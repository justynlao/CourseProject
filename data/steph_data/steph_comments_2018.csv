"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson."
Love it when the little guys win such battles.  Reminds me of [Stephen Curry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzszeBrAj5s) boxing out Dwight Howard for the offensive board.
The following list is **my opinion**. I have arguments for every ''controversial'' pick (Westbrook over Curry and Harden in particular).  1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Russell Westbrook  4) Stephen Curry  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Giannis Antetokounmpo  8) Kawhi Leonard (despite being injured for almost the whole season)  9) DeMarcus Cousins  10) Jimmy Butler  11) Chris Paul  12) **Kyrie Irving**  13) Paul George  14) DeMar DeRozan  15) John Wall  16) Damian Lillard  17) Karl Anthony Towns  18) Joel Embiid  19) LaMarcus Aldridge  20) Kristaps Porzingis
Stephen Curry
"I knew that Steph was Wardell Stephen Curry Jr for years, and I knew that Steph's dad was Dell Curry for years, but up until a couple months ago, I never made the Wardell = Dell connection. I guess I thought Dell Curry's full name was Wardell Dell Curry."
"I mean, if we're picking *any* player from *any* era then the following team of Monstars would curb-stomp the present day Warriors. If these players are all in their primes:   PG: Stephen Curry   SG: Michael Jordan   SF: JR   PF: Lebron James  C: IT"
"Stephen ""on pace for the most efficient 25+ppg scoring season of all time"" Curry "
Behind Stephen Curry aka the true MVP in the 2017-18 season.  If Curry played as many minutes and and shot the same amount of FGs as those other clown MVP candidates then Curry's stats would look way better than it already is.  Also with a stacked team it's natural for all players stats to be lower but current Curry stats is just scary considering all the other players he got on his team.
The official list of top 5 according to me and I don't think unless you're biased you should have an issue with is.....  1) LBJ  2) Kevin Durant  3) Stephen Curry (Now I love the guy and I know a lot of folks want me to put him before KD but let us just face reality right now together)  4) James Harden  5) Brodie

"Wardell Stephen Curry, or Melo."
Stephen Curry. Most people didn't hate him during the 2015 season when the Warriors won the championship. He started to get a lot of hate when he led the Warriors to a crazy regular season record in 2016.
"Too much work, I'd much rather make a 12-man team using the last 12 drafts!  2017: **Donovan Mitchell**  2016: **Malcolm Brogdon**  2015: **Kristaps Porzingis**  2014: **TJ Warren**  2013: **Giannis Antetokounmpo**  2012: **Khris Middleton**  2011: **Kawhi Leonard**  2010: **Larry Sanders**  2009: **Stephen Curry**  2008: **Courtney Lee**  2007: **Mike Conley**  2006: **Rodney Carney**  Now *there's* a team!"
No. Bill Russell is to defense as Stephen Curry is to shooting. That’s why Russ is a GOAT tier player while Big Ben/Rodman/Deke are not top 50.
[just gonna leave this here](http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-knee-injury-evident-game-7-2016-6)
Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are tied with the greatest 3-1 chocking performance ever.
"Two top two players. Including the best, Stephen Wardell Curry."
"Stephen is a better scorer and has been a more efficient passer this year, LeBron isn't a great defender anymore and for their roles, they're quite a bit similar as defenders. As a matter of fact, Curry has improved his teammate's play better than LeBron does. His gravity is insane, his teammates on/off shooting splits show more impact than LeBron.  Durant has been known by most people to be a better scorer and has been a much much better defender this year.   So what does he have? That he can rebound better than Curry and can pass and maybe rebound better than Durant?  This is quite a bit of homerism, but there's an argument to be made.  Edit: Whatever (assumingly) Warrior's fan that is insta downvoting the people that are disagreeing with me needs to stop, downvoting for opinions is stupid and frankly you're making me look bad because you're making it seem like I'm doing it out of pettiness 🙄"
Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are under 30 and on the same team. There's zero reason to compete now.
"He may technically be more efficient, but that's with lower volume. Let's compare.   Curry for his career has a TS% of 62% and an eFG% of 57.8%, but he does this taking **16.9 FGA per game.**  Jordan, on the other hand, has a TS% of 63.3% for his career which is only 1.3% higher and a eFG% of 67.6% which is almost 10% higher (so I will give you that). However, he only attempts **5.6 FG a game.**   Basically, although the stats point to Jordan being more efficient by the numbers, he shoots a lot less than Curry does per game. The fact Curry can almost replicate his numbers at such a higher volume speaks a lot to his insane efficiency.   [A few snippets from this article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/):   &gt;Among players with more than 200 shots, Curry was only the fourth-most-efficient shooter on a shot-by-shot basis (behind Kyle Korver, DeAndre Jordan and Kevin Durant) **Yet Curry has more than 1,600 shots in that span, while none of the other three players has even half that. He has 371 total points added from shooting efficiency alone, with Korver in second place with 247.** Note that this doesn’t include additional value from free throws earned — which would probably make Curry’s advantage even greater (Curry has 416 made free throws in the period, compared to Kyle Korver’s 118).  Granted that article doesn't detail his full career, that should at least show you just how efficient Steph has become.  Lastly let's look at another efficiency stat: PER  Throughout his career, Jordan's PER is only 18.4. Steph, in comparison, has a career PER **23.8**. That's a pretty colossal difference.   In summary, there is a lot more to the efficiency story than just TS% and eFG% alone. "
"Well he isnt.    The stats show that. Steph shoots a ton more than Reggie and he also makes it as a higher % than Reggie ever did.     https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;player_id2_hint=Reggie+Miller&amp;player_id2_select=Reggie+Miller&amp;player_id2=millere01&amp;idx=players    The numbers speak for themselves. Steph is a better three point and free throw shooter.    Here is a comparrison of Steph, Reggie, Ray, and Klay. Probably considered the 4 best shooters of all time.    https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;player_id2_hint=Reggie+Miller&amp;player_id2_select=Reggie+Miller&amp;player_id2=millere01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Ray+Allen&amp;player_id3_select=Ray+Allen&amp;player_id3=allenra02&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Klay+Thompson&amp;player_id4_select=Klay+Thompson&amp;player_id4=thompkl01&amp;idx=players    I will even go out on a limb and say Steph is #1 all time and Klay is the #2 best shooter of all time. I dont even think its that big of a limb to be honest. Ray and Reggie were great. But Steph and Klay are both better shooters. Is what it is. Shooting you can prove by statistics."

"Im sure that age is significant to you but the fact remains that stephen curry has caused a majority of teams to focus more on three point shooting. Whereas lebron james in his tremendous talents has not caused an upswing in driving and slashing and all the other insane things that he does), simply because nobody else is that talented in as many aspects of the game as he is. Whereas gm's did the math and figured out that if the could hire more snipers they would have a greater percentage of winning the game. 3&gt;2 And yes Steph was the forefront of that. Also ive been watching basketball live for the last 25 years. Sorry im not 50"

"Finally found some articles with that info in them:  http://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Stephen-Curry-nearly-automatic-from-the-12310503.php  &gt; Assistant coach Bruce Fraser has encouraged Curry to work at “selling fouls.” That’s one big reason Houston guard James Harden averaged more than 10 free-throw attempts per game in each of the past three seasons, as he sought contact and convinced referees to call a foul. &gt;  &gt; Curry, no natural actor, is gradually learning the fine art of shouting when he takes a shot in traffic, or demonstratively reacting at the slightest nudge or bump. &gt;  &gt; “I’m not great at it,” he said. “My tendency, especially when I’m in space, is to just play basketball. And basketball to me is trying to score, not really looking to create contact and get the foul called.… &gt;  &gt; Fraser “has been really consistent with his message, because he thinks there are times I can kind of let the ref know what’s going on. But it’s hard for me to always be in that mind-set, because I’m trying to create space, get my shot off and play basketball the way I’ve played it my entire life.”   Nothing more to it in [some](https://247sports.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/Bolt/warriors-assistant-coach-encourages-stephen-curry-sell-fouls-109538160) [others](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2741102-stephen-curry-is-getting-the-calls-and-its-no-accident) I found, which just copy this part, but I think it was really Bruce the specific person who was encouraging/helping him at that, is he the same guy which helped Steph with his landing?"
"1.	Lebron James 2.	Stephen Curry 3.	Kevin Durant 4.	James Harden 5.	Giannis Antetokounpo  6.	Anthony Davis 7.	Kawhi Leonard  I get it, Russ fills the stat sheet every night... But so do all of these guys. I'd understand putting him ahead of Kawhi because Kawhi has been out the whole year, so that puts him at 7th.  Westbrook fills the stat sheet just like the other guys, except he isn't nearly as efficient as any of them.  Russ also hasn't proven himself able to be a leader of a team. Even this year, Melo and PG joined him and before this recent win streak, the Thunder were hardly .500. Even then, if you actually look at who they have played over this win streak, it's all been straight trash teams! Last year he had a decent team and still the Thunder were only the 6th seed and didn't even make it out of the first round.  Look, I get it it! He scores lots of points, grabs lots of boards, and gets lots of assists. But he doesn't do it efficiently and he doesn't lead his team's to success. You put any of those other 7 guys in his same situations either this year or last and both years the Thunder would have a better record, and that's why Russ isn't a top 5 player."
I remember AI even says  Kyrie and Steph are better ball handlers than him   [link](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2465203-allen-iverson-says-stephen-curry-and-kyrie-irving-have-better-handles-than-him.amp.html)
"Kyrie Irving **is** a top 3 point guard in the NBA **if** any one of Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, or Chris Paul die. "
" &gt;Yeah sure, I don't think that I was hostile in any way, I justed pointed out that what you are saying is ridiculous.   Great perception   &gt;I think it would work, both are capable playmakers and we've certainly seen backcourts with less combined playmaking ability do well. I mean just think of Curry/Thompson, those two seem to be doing just fine and Thompson is nowhere the passer that Harden or Kyrie is while Steph is on a similar level in that regard.  Thompson is way more than a scorer/passer, but okay    &gt;  &gt;Similar to you, when you started a discussion on whether you can say that one player is superior to the other under my comment about how players are remembered as time passes.  &gt;&gt;LeBron, WHICH I ACCIDENTALLY PUT INSTEAD OF KYRIE &gt; &gt;So you meant to put Kyrie twice? Right now it reads ""Rodman would not be able to slot into any team into the NBA and automatically make them better. Same thing with Kyrie and LeBron"". I don't really buy that you wanted it to say ""Same thing with Kyrie and Kyrie"".   I meant to say CP3 and Kyrie. It's not that hard to figure out that I DIDN'T mean LeBron or Kyrie twice   &gt;  &gt;What about Westbrook? He averaged a 30 point triple double, does he not add just as many, if not even more, points/rebounds/assists?  How many shots does he take, how many times does he pass to the right man and not force a ball  If you think assists are the defining factor of a a good passer, you're doing yourself a disservice    &gt; &gt;Are you really serious about that last bit? James Harden averages 9.1 assists this year and he is pretty much the best isolation scorer in the NBA. To me that doesn't seem like he focuses ""soley [sic] on shooting"".  Holy shit. Focusing more on shooting doesn't mean he stops passing. You seriously think Harden is doing more passing as a Rocket with CP3 than without?    &gt;Well, that was when he played with LeBron. In Boston, Kyrie doesn't have LeBron setting him up and he and his team seem to be doing just fine.  But even in Cleavand, he scored off of ISO drives and shots all the time. He wasn't part of the offensive structure too much. LeBron ran the offense,  not Kyrie    &gt; &gt;Why? I'm fully confident in saying that Stephen Curry is a better player and a better point guard than MCW. That's just the way it is. By the way, MCW won rookie of the year in 2014, tells a lot about how much you know about the NBA that you don't even know who he is.  I'm not saying Curry vs MCW, I'm talking about Curry vs any NBA player. The comparison falls short for any player VS curry unless you are saying they're as good as passing/defense/rebounding    &gt; &gt;Here's an example: CP3 is a better defender than Kyrie. What happens, now that we discovered that basketball is about more than just scoring and passing? Seriously, you can bring in a lot more factors into a discussion like that and it's not that hard to get to a conclusion about who is better.  Yeah I know all the factors? I literally commented on why LeBron is LeBron.  It's not just assists and points. It's his defense, rebounds,  overall ball movement, etc?     &gt;I agree, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible to say who is better between the two. Let me make an analogy. You have a beat up and very old Volkswagen Beetle and you have a brand new BMW 3 series. The Beetle is certainly the better choice when you want to go mud racing, but that doesn't change that the BMW is the better overall car.  But that analogy isn't fair   You need to compare two equals   Are you saying that CP3 is the mud car and the BMW is Kyrie?  I feel it would be more fair to compare a $250,000 SUV that sits a whole family to a $250,000 BMW/Audi/Porsche "
"&gt;Honestly, you need to learn how to how have a conversation without being hostile and condescending   Yeah sure, I don't think that I was hostile in any way, I justed pointed out that what you are saying is ridiculous.  &gt;Kyrie and Harden would never work without a ball passing player like CP3  I think it would work, both are capable playmakers and we've certainly seen backcourts with less combined playmaking ability do well. I mean just think of Curry/Thompson, those two seem to be doing just fine and Thompson is nowhere the passer that Harden or Kyrie is while Steph is on a similar level in that regard.  &gt;CP3 wouldn't work on a team without scorers around him to make shots   Kyrie wouldn't either, no one can score 100 PPG.  &gt;You completely missed my point   Similar to you, when you started a discussion on whether you can say that one player is superior to the other under my comment about how players are remembered as time passes.  &gt;LeBron, WHICH I ACCIDENTALLY PUT INSTEAD OF KYRIE  So you meant to put Kyrie twice? Right now it reads ""Rodman would not be able to slot into any team into the NBA and automatically make them better. Same thing with Kyrie and LeBron"". I don't really buy that you wanted it to say ""Same thing with Kyrie and Kyrie"".  &gt;There's quite a few, but there is no player with the rebounds, points and assists LeBron adds in the modern era   What about Westbrook? He averaged a 30 point triple double, does he not add just as many, if not even more, points/rebounds/assists?  &gt;Now going back to CP3, he fits perfectly into Houston. He shares the ball, plays great ball defense, and allows Harden to focus soley on shooting   Are you really serious about that last bit? James Harden averages 9.1 assists this year and he is pretty much the best isolation scorer in the NBA. To me that doesn't seem like he focuses ""soley [sic] on shooting"".  &gt;Kyrie works as the primary scorer. In the finals they won after being down 3-1, Kyrie was the PG, but the offense ran through LeBron and Kyrie's job wasn't to conduct the offense, but to put the ball in the net. Watch the highlights from that final. Kyrie scored off of ISO shots, drives, or LeBron finding him with a wide open shot  Well, that was when he played with LeBron. In Boston, Kyrie doesn't have LeBron setting him up and he and his team seem to be doing just fine.  &gt;As for your Steph Curry compared to whoever, it only works if you're saying that they're as good as passing, or whatever as Curry is shooting and scoring   Why? I'm fully confident in saying that Stephen Curry is a better player and a better point guard than MCW. That's just the way it is. By the way, MCW won rookie of the year in 2014, tells a lot about how much you know about the NBA that you don't even know who he is.  &gt;CP3 is as good of a passer as Kyrie is a scorer So who's better?   Here's an example: CP3 is a better defender than Kyrie. What happens, now that we discovered that basketball is about more than just scoring and passing? Seriously, you can bring in a lot more factors into a discussion like that and it's not that hard to get to a conclusion about who is better.  &gt;They're better in different scenarios for different teams   I agree, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible to say who is better between the two. Let me make an analogy. You have a beat up and very old Volkswagen Beetle and you have a brand new BMW 3 series. The Beetle is certainly the better choice when you want to go mud racing, but that doesn't change that the BMW is the better overall car."
Except for when he went on national tv and proclaimed that Harden was the MVP  https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/04/03/stephen-curry-responds-to-mark-jacksons-mvp-endorsement-of-james-harden/
"If it's today G Stephen Curry G Klay Thompson F Kawhi Leonard F LeBron James C Rudy Gobert I think it would be the best possible, maybe with KD instead of Kawhi Leonard, but I think it would to be too much high usage player, as Kawhi in this situation would kind of take a step down and be more of what Paul George has been for the Thunder."
There are models and most follow a Weibull pattern so your assumption is correct more often then not at least for overall efficiency.  He's FiveRhirtyEights player card for Steph and how his career project out as far as WAR goes: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/stephen-curry/  WAR isn't a perfect example of something like TS% especially for a shooter who can potentially evolve.sj. 
It's so disrespectful to hear anyone say Stephen Curry isn't a top 3 player. The only reason KD and LeBron are above him is because of their size and height.
Stephen Curry has probably the 2nd worst fanboys aside from LeBron James.
Stephen Curry is also a genetic freak of nature.

"It's a reference to Steph's ""infamous"" Nike meeting.   &gt;The pitch meeting, according to Steph's father Dell, who was present, kicked off with one Nike official accidentally addressing Stephen as ""Steph-on,"" the moniker, of course, of Steve Urkel's alter ego in Family Matters. ""I heard some people pronounce his name wrong before,"" says Dell Curry. ""I wasn't surprised. I was surprised that I didn't get a correction.""  &gt;It got worse from there. A PowerPoint slide featured Kevin Durant's name, presumably left on by accident, presumably residue from repurposed materials. ""I stopped paying attention after that,"" Dell says. Though Dell resolved to ""keep a poker face,"" throughout the entirety of the pitch, the decision to leave Nike was in the works."
55 is worse than 67 or 61.  Congratulations to Stephen Curry/Kevin Durant/Kawhi Leonard on their 2017 MVP.
"I'm just posting a tweet, relax friend. I think it's dumb but entertaining. It's mostly interesting because it shows how valuable NBA players are. [Steph is taking home ~15.3m dollars in salary after taxes this year](http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-salary-taxes-nba-2017-9), so propotionally, if he played 80 games at 32 minutes a game, he'd make ~$5962.46 per minute he's on the court. The amazing thing about that number is it's a massive underpay relative to his value, not only in basketball production but his sheer marketability. "
"&gt;The NBA will not televise the NBA All-Star draft. Initially, that decision makes you wonder why even have it at all. The whole point is the drama of picking and choosing, the politics and the pettiness. That’s the riveting part, not the East and West being mixed.  &gt;But the more I think about it, the more I come to see why the NBA is passing on the playground-style draft. Because it could go like this:  &gt;Commissioner Adam Silver: LeBron James, you have the first pick. Stephen Curry, you pick second.  &gt;LeBron: Gimmie KD.  &gt;Kevin Durant: That’s right. No. 1!  &gt;LeBron: You were supposed to go to the Warrriors and squash the Under Armour empire by now. But somehow, the Curry 4s are selling and not on sale at Ross.  &gt;Durant: But …  &gt;LeBron: You had one job.  &gt;Durant: You don’t understand the spell he has on 13-year-olds, man.  &gt;LeBron: That’s why I’m picking you first. I’m bequeathing you the throne so you can take over middle schools...   That's what a copy/paste into notepad gets you after highlighting everything. It seems pretty stupid"

What are you doing???  Klay: I can’t find my lighter.  Curry: Man, come over here. I picked you.  Silver: Klay Thompson is not eligible for the first round. You must choose from the pool of starters that were voted in.  Draymond Green: (*through gritted teeth*) Steph! That’s not the plan!  Green nods his head twice to the right.  Curry: Oh yeah! My bad. You know me. I lose focus sometimes.  Ron Adams: Yeah, we know!  Curry: Give me Anthony Davis.  Davis: Niiiiice!  Kyrie Irving: Hol’ up … hol’ up … I see what’s happening here.  LeBron: Y’all doing this again???  Curry: What? I’m picking players just like you. Why is it a problem when I select a player???  LeBron: Nah. It’s cool, Steph. It’s cool. I’m ready this time.  Whadduya say Ky! Down for one more run together?  Kyrie: Respectful requests usually come with a please.  LeBron: I’m the King!! I don’t say please to nobody. What I look like?!?!  Draymond: Don’t let him talk to you like that Ky!  Kyrie: See, this is why I left.  LeBron: I don’t care! I’m taking James Harden!  KD: (*whispers in Bron’s ear*) You ain’t supposed to pick him. He with adidas.  Bron: WE RUN NIKE! And Kyrie acting funny again! I’m through with him!  Kyrie: Control is but an illusion. The truly free are those who surrender to the reality of having no control.  Curry: I’ll take Kyrie. My bad, James. You were my next pick.  LeBron: We need some size. Lemme see. … Give me Joel Embiid.  Embiid: Finally. You guys were taking too long to trust the process. I should have been the first pick.  LeBron: Don’t trip, bro. I’ll make sure Rihanna holla at you as a bonus.  Embiid: I told everybody I’m off her now. She didn’t want me then, I don’t want her.  Harden: You say that now. You know you wanna see her nakey nakey naked.  Curry: Yes! Give me Giannis!  Draymond: Told you we’d get him too! This chess. This ain’t checkers!  Cousins: You betta pick me, Bron! I ain’t no last pick!  Davis: You not last. You see all these cats out here?  Cousins: Last of the first round! I ain’t last at nothing. Bron, don’t play me out here like this.  LeBron: Cuz, I already got Joel. I can’t have two centers.  Cousins: I ain’t just a center fool! Stop tryna play me! I play the four and I can run the point. My 3 is better than yours!  Durant: Pick Cuz, man. You know he gone blow a gasket if you don’t. Let him live.  LeBron: C’mon Cuz. You know I got you.  Cousins: That’s what I thought!  Thompson: Here it is! Found my lighter!  Curry: Let’s go DeMar DeRozan. You know I love The Six.  DeRozan: Right on. Right on. Let’s have some fun.  Drake: Somebody said The Six?  Durant: Don’t nobody give a damn about no Drake night!  Silver: This is a closed meeting, Aubrey.  Drake: I’m with DeMar. He said I can get one of his stints.  Silver: That’s not allowed under the CBA.  Drake: But I’m designing the uniforms.  Russell Westbrook: No you ain’t! I already set up a designer from Milan to make 'em!  Drake: But I’m making a soundtrack.  Damian Lillard: Too late. I’m already on it.  Drake: Can I at least perform at halftime?  Victor Oladipo: I could use another background singer. You a tenor, right?  Silver: So the starting lineups go as follows:  Team LeBron James consists of himself, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid and DeMarcus Cousins.  Team Stephen Curry consists of himself, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Giannis Antetokounmpo and DeMar DeRozan.  Now for the reserves. LeBron, since you had the first pick in the first round, Steph you get the first pick of the second round.  Curry: My brother of Splash. Klay Thompson.  Thompson: So, I’m set right? That’s all you need from me?  Draymond: Klay, where is you going bro???  Thompson: Um … I’m just … about to make sure Rocco is still safe outside.  Cousins: I’m coming witchu.  Silver: To check on Rocco?  Cousins: Um … yeah. It’s like he both our dog. We just keep him at Klay house.  Silver: You two are not checking on Rocco without me. Stay here. LeBron, your pick.  LeBron: Let’s go Russ!  Westbrook: Hell nah! I ain’t playing with him!  LeBron: Oh, so you gone play for Steph???  Westbrook: I don’t play for nobody! I play for myself! Because why not!  KD: Brodie calm down with all that. Just play basketball, man. Cut the act.  Curry: I ain’t picking him. I wanna win.  Westbrook: What you say!?! I’ll play you 1-on-1 right now!  LeBron: Chill y’all! Damn! Russ. Let’s go Brodie. We hooping.  Silver: Curry, your next pick, please.  Thompson: Sucks. It’s a beautiful, sunny day outside and I’m stuck in here.  Curry: Draymond.  LeBron: I’ll take Jimmy Butler.  Curry: Karl-Anthony Towns.  LeBron: Kristaps Porzingis.  Curry: Victor Oladipo.  Draymond: Oh, we about to destroy y’all!  KD: Bet a rack.  Draymond: Bet 5 racks.  KD: Done. Easy money.  LeBron: D-Wade. Where D-Wade at?  Silver: You are only allowed to select from the current crop of All-Stars.  LeBron: What?! I’m the King! I can pick my brother if I want!  Chris Paul: Well actually, Bron, as the president of the players association, I can confirm that the agreement was only current All-Stars.  LeBron: Why would you even agree to that? You know I gotta have my guys with me.  CP: That’s not true. I believe in you bro. You can do anything.  Curry: It’s you can do ALL things. If you gone steal my slogan, at least get it right.  Kyrie: But didn’t you steal it from the Bible, though?  Curry: It’s not stealing if it’s from the Bible.  Silver: LeBron, please make your next selection.  LeBron: John Wall.  Curry: This one for The Town. Give me Dame.  LeBron: Giiiiiive meeeee … LA.  Kyrie: See! I knew you was going to the Lakers!  Paul George: Let’s goooooooooooo!  LeBron: Chill out! I meant give me LaMarcus Aldridge! Geez.  Curry: Bradley Beal.  LeBron: I see what you’re doing. Trying to load up on shooters?  Curry: (*whispers*) And a little light recruiting.  LeBron: Kyle Lowry.  Curry: OK, last pick. Hmmmm. This is tough.  I’ma close my eyes and throw my mouthpiece. Whoever I hit is my pick.  Embiid: But I thought you only threw it at refs and fans.  Draymond: You’re not allowed to talk until you make the playoffs.  Curry: It was a joke. Relax. Give me Kev … no, give me Al Horford.  Kevin Love: Dammit, Steph! C’mon bro! I promise I won’t lock you up on the perimeter ever again.  Wall to Beal: Look at Kyrie over there cracking up.  Beal: Hilarious.  Wall: I bet he’s so glad he’s out of that mess.  Beal: Must feel good. Tops in the East. Free from his ball-dominant co-star who tries to control everything. He’s living the life.  Wall: Riiiight … wait, what you trying to say???  LeBron: Give me CP. I ain’t taking K-Love.  Silver: Again, you can only pick current All-Stars.  LeBron: HE’S THE GREATEST POINT GUARD EVER. How is he not an All-Star this year???  CP: It’s cool. Me, Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green got somewhere to go anyway.  Blake Griffin: You sure you don’t want a go-to guy like Lou Williams?  Curry: Let him have CP. He is All-Star worthy.  Silver: The coaches did not vote him in. I can’t allow it.  LeBron: Not surprised. I never get any calls in this league anymore.  Curry: All right, I’ll take Kevin Love as my final pick.  LeBron: You can have him. Al Horford, let’s go.  Horford: Great. I’m on the top seed in the East and the last pick? Do I get a prize or something?  Harden: You get to win. Look at our squad.  Thompson: We about to light it up. We’ve got the best shooters on the globe.  Kyrie: Well, actually, it’s not a …  Butler: Let it go, Ky. Just let it go.  "
I'm pretty sure [it is] (http://www.nba.com/article/2018/03/25/golden-state-warriors-coach-steve-kerr-rules-out-stephen-curry-first-round)  Someone correct me if I'm wrong though
"I guess nobody really reads articles anymore.  &gt;Option A: He can sign a two-year deal with a 2019-20 player option in which the first-year earnings would be $30 million and the option year worth $31.5 million. The only benefit in signing this contract is that the salary cap is expected to jump from $101 million (2018-19) to $108 million (2019-20). Durant could then opt out after the 2018-19 season and sign a five-year, $219 million contract ($37.8 million, $40.8 million, $43.8 million, $46.8 million and $49.9 million).  &gt;Option B: He can sign a four-year max contract valued at around $158 million. His annual pay would be $35.3 million, $38.2 million, $41 million and $43.8 million.  &gt;Option C: He can agree to a three-year deal with a player option after the second season. His income would go from $35.3 million to $38.2 million, and the option year would be $41 million. The salary cap in 2020-21 is expected to be approximately $112 million. Or, in this scenario, Durant could opt out and sign a five-year, $228 million contract with a starting salary of $39.4 million -- the same contract Anthony Davis is eligible to sign with New Orleans in 2019.  &gt;**Under Option C, Durant would be eligible for a no-trade clause because he would have played four seasons with the Warriors and been in the NBA for eight seasons.** But the Warriors' negotiations with Stephen Curry last summer showed that the team's ownership is reluctant to put a no-trade clause in a contract."
Very disrespectful to Stephen Curry 
"It's ok if it's Heat or Chalmers related, but it would be silly and derailing to just randomly post Chalmers [face](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OGrMmq7yT0U/US52Us1pRXI/AAAAAAAAGng/qRzYeX9EG0U/s1600/Stephen+Curry+Soon.jpg) when it's not related to the topic."
"The problem is any time you try to point out that Stephen Curry is the best player on here, Kevin Durant and/or his business manager friend get on here with their alt accounts and brigade the crap out of you."
"Everyone is talking about how garbage we were playing, and yeah, we got Jingled. But all I see is a team that...  #Didn't lose by 41!  Oh, and no injuries. And a ROTY.  And a COTY.  And no injuries.  And a sexy Spainard. And no injuries.  &amp;nbsp;  ^^I ^^miss ^^Wardell ^^Stephen ^^Curry ^^II "
"*As much* to winning basketball as Stephen Curry who clearly makes the game easier for the players around him. It's much more difficult to build an egalitarian offense around Durant.  Durant is in the conversation for best scorer of all time, sure. Curry is the GOAT PG scorer, and he gives everyone that plays with him a *massive* boost in performance."
"It amazes me how everyone paraphrases this interview, but somehow his answer slightly more dickish each time.    When they asked if any other rookies ""caught his attention"",  he shook his head and said “I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That’s where I want to be. I think for me, that’s what I love to watch.”  Him saying he doesn't follow other rookies and only watches superstars is a lot different than dogging the other rookies.  "
"Seriously dude, introspection. Read the damn quote. Simmons was asked if any other rookies had caught his attention. He said none had. **he never mentioned Mitchell, nor any other rookie.** All he said is that he watches the greats, not other rookies.  People made it into a diss at Mitchell because Mitchell is the 2nd best rookie this year, but Ben Simmons didn’t say a single damn thing about Mitchell.  For someone who has literally no idea what you’re talking about, you’re really full of yourself. Can you be a big enough person to admit you were wrong, or are you going to continue obliviously insulting me like I’m the one out of my depth?  “None,” Simmons responded promptly. “I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That’s where I want to be. I think for me, that’s what I love to watch.”"
"Ben's comments were taken out of context.  EDI: This is the full quote (same thing he said before the season):  ""None,"" Simmons told ESPN. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch."""

"Interior defence is more important than interior offence because terrible interior defence will end up giving extremely high probability layups and dunks. Perimeter offence should be more important than perimeter defence, especially with how guys are shooting the ball now. You have someone like Stephen Curry or Damian Lillard that are shooting 30+ footers with high volume. How are you supposed to guard that? Close out tightly and let them blow by you? Perimeter defence becomes less of a deciding factor against the league's best perimeter offences imo. Wide open 3's are going to generate less PPP than wide opens layups and dunks, that's what it comes down to. "
"You should re-read the article.  They didn't ask which rookies whose accomplishments he was ""aware of"".  They asked which rookies caught his attention.    ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  Hes clearly not watching other rookies.  Hes watching the league's best players."
Stephen Curry is the best PG of all time that has a normal point guard height.
"&gt;》I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch  I get that. He wants to be where those guys are. BUT he still Said that no other rookies have caught his eye. Zero % chance he hasn't noticed donovan and what he is doing "
"I love Lebron, but you have a point. It's not like he [squatted down and pretended to take a dump on the court or anything.](https://thebiglead.com/2017/06/08/did-stephen-curry-pretend-to-take-a-poop-on-the-court-after-kevin-durants-dagger/)"
"Stephen Curry is a better player right now  than he was back in 2016. So instead of averaging 30ppg, he’s averaging 26.. who cares?  He’s still doing his job and being efficient while doing it.  Kds presence will lessen Currys burden during the regular season. In the postseason, he will go back to being the Baby Faced Assassin, regardless of whether or not KD is on the team. Last postseason, Curry averaged 28,6,5. The system still does and will continue to revolve around Curry because that’s what made the Warriors exceptionally successful. If the Warriors decides to build a system around Kd, then we will see a OkC type team with Kd, which is clearly not as good.  Curry just needs to remain healthy, which I believe he will be moving forward because A) he has been an iron man for the last five years B) his injuries this year have all been freakish.  "

"**STEPHEN CURRY** with a **40** INCH VERTICAL  I joke, but seriously, him being a 41% 3 point shooter was a big positive and it's disappointing it hasn't carried over to the NBA."
"Did you read the article?  ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  He's talking all-time, historical greatness.  I don't think it has to be considered a slam on Mitchell, Believe me, as a diehard Mitchell fan I'd defend the shit outta that if I sensed any shade. I just think his comment is a byproduct of thinking big picture/long term/historical greatness. And good for him.  I honestly think anyone interpreting Ben as having any sort of beef with Mitchell is just looking for a fight."
"**When the 6-foot-10 point guard was told the Rookie of the Year race appears to be a two-man show, he buried his head down and proceeded to chuckle. Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words.  ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""**  Nobody asked him what other rookies he likes or thinks are good.  They asked him which rookies ""caught his attention"" and he responded saying none because he follows the greats, since that's where he wants to be someday.  That's a perfectly acceptable answer and isn't dogging DM or any other rookies.  Ppl will play that narrative, but it's a stretch. "

"Why are Kd, LBJ, and the Stephen part of Curry and Westbrook part of Russel in brackets?"
"""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch."""

Waddell Stephen Curry
"**All-NBA First Team**  * Guard: James Harden, Houston Rockets * Guard: Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers * Forward: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers * Forward: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors * Center: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans  The five players from my MVP ballot fit nicely here. Stephen Curry and Chris Paul could’ve gotten Lillard’s spot, but both played less than 60 games. Giannis Antetokounmpo missed out on a first team forward spot only because of the brilliance of James and Durant, while Joel Embiid wasn’t good enough this season to outdo Davis for the first team center spot.  **All-NBA Second Team**  * Guard: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors * Guard: Chris Paul, Houston Rockets * Forward: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks * Forward: LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs * Center: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  Curry, Paul, Antetokounmpo and Embiid were all obvious selections for the second team, leaving just one forward spot up for grabs. That went to Aldridge, who has been outstanding for San Antonio, keeping the Spurs in the playoff hunt despite only having Kawhi Leonard for nine games due to his bizarre, season-long quad issues.  **All-NBA Third Team**  * Guard: Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder * Guard: DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors * Forward: Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder * Forward: Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves * Center: Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  Westbrook is close to averaging another triple-double, while DeRozan has been the engine of a Raptors team that could win 60 games. George and Butler were the clear choices as third-team forwards, with the NBA thankfully changing Butler’s eligibility from guard only to guard/forward, alleviating a very difficult task of trying to find a sixth forward worth including.  The final spot came down to Karl-Anthony Towns or Gobert, the league’s best offensive and defensive centers, respectively. By the slimmest of margins, Gobert gets the nod.  **All-Defensive First Team**  * Guard: Jrue Holiday, New Orleans Pelicans * Guard: Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers * Forward: Al Horford, Boston Celtics * Forward: Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder * Center: Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  Gobert, the defensive player of the year, was an easy choice, and sliding Horford over to forward makes for two of those. Holiday and Oladipo make their teams massively better when they are on the court (Indiana is 7.3 points per 100 possessions better with Oladipo out there and New Orleans is a full nine points per 100 possessions better when Holiday plays). George gets the final spot — both because he’s a great defender and as a nod to Andre Roberson, who was on pace to be the league’s best defensive player before suffering a season-ending knee injury.  **All-Defensive Second Team**  * Guard: Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves * Guard: Dejounte Murray, San Antonio Spurs * Forward: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans * Forward: Robert Covington, Philadelphia 76ers * Center: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  Minnesota has struggled on defense all season long, but would be completely lost without Butler (they are 7.4 points per 100 better defensively with him on the court). Murray, on the other hand, made a real impact in his second season, and first as a starter. Covington is the prototypical “3-and-D” player, and Davis is simply a monster. Embiid was the automatic choice as the second-team center.  **All-Rookie First Team**  1. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers 2. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz 3. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics 4. Lauri Markkanen, Chicago Bulls 5. Kyle Kuzma, Los Angeles Lakers  Simmons, Mitchell and Tatum were automatics. Markkanen has exceeded just about everyone’s expectations in Chicago, looking like the foundational piece the team hoped he’d be. Kuzma has predictably cooled off after his hot start, but still has been a gem of a find as a late-first rounder.  **All-Rookie Second Team**  1. John Collins, Atlanta Hawks 2. Lonzo Ball, Los Angeles Lakers 3. Dennis Smith, Jr., Dallas Mavericks 4. Bogdan Bogdanovic, Sacramento Kings 5. Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat  Trying to fill out the all-rookie second team is always a challenge, but this year was easier than most thanks to a deep class. Collins has emerged as a long-term rotation piece in Atlanta. Ball — despite all of the noise surrounding him — has actually contributed to winning as a rookie point guard, which is hard to do. Smith had an encouraging year in Dallas, where he’s been given the reins as the future of the franchise. Bogdanovic has been Sacramento’s best player, while Adebayo has shown the supreme athletic tools that will likely make him Hassan Whiteside’s successor in the middle in Miami.  edit: formatting"
"Yeah, they tried to make that on a ""who has had the best career"" and cut off people with short careers because of that. Using the data I collected last year, the current VORP leaders that are active players (this may be a bit off as it's last years data) is:  * Lebron James * HUGE DROPOFF * Chris Paul * Dirk Nowitzki * Dwyane Wade * Vince Carter * Pau Gasol * Russell Westbrook * Kevin Durant * Manu Ginobili * Andre Iguodala * Stephen Curry  So Manu is probably one of the bigger steals of the century.  edit: overperforming starting 5:  * SG - Manu (VORP as of 2017: 46.8, pick 57) - 1999 - 30th overall in VORP/Game * PF - Paul Millsap (VORP as of 2017:33.5, pick 47) - 2006 - 47th overall in VORP/Game * PG - Kyle Lowry (VORP as of 2017: 31.5, pick 24) - 2006 - 37th overall in VORP/Game  * SF - Kawhi Leonard (VORP as of 2017: 25.6, pick 15) - 2011 - 13th overall in VORP/Game * C - Marc Gasol (VORP as of 2017: 31.2, pick 48) - 2007 - 23rd overall in VORP/Game  This being said Nikola Jokic should probably be there at C instead (VORP as of 2018: 13.7, pick 41) - 2014 - 17th overall in VORP/Game (2017) or maybe even Rudy Gobert (VORP as of 2018: 15, pick 27) - 2013 - 34th overall in VORP/Game (2017)  edit 2: definitely a case for jimmy G buckets as well (VORP as of 2018: 23, pick 30) - 2011 - 25th overall in VORP/Game"

"Stephen Curry just excited everything way more. He starts hitting some threes, starts dancing around. The crowd starts going wild. The other team turns it over in the excitement, Curry hits another three. The Warriors are all of a sudden up 25, and Curry rests the 4th, rinse and repeat.  Not even sure it's something quantifiable in the stats. Curry scoring runs are like no other player I've ever seen. The possibility of winning just disappears so fast when Curry catches fire. "
"Bill Simmons: ""Kevin Durant is just as important to the Golden State Warriors as Stephen Curry"".  LOL."
Stephen Curry 
"[Take a look for yourself if you think Harden had the stats on him](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y1=2015&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id2_select=James+Harden&amp;y2=2015&amp;player_id2=hardeja01&amp;idx=players). The stats were very, very comparable. Also, defense, gravity, record setting 3s etc. I think the problem with consistency started with Westbrook winning last year though. That one should have been Harden's. But I don't think the stats argument goes in favor of Harden in 2015 if we're choosing that route for consistency."
"For contrast, the Warriors are 3-0 when Curry scored 40 points. 2 of these were with Durant, and 1 of these was with the Classic Warriors.   Since 2014-2015 (the Steve Kerr era), the Warriors are 23-1 when Stephen Curry scored 40 or more points.   Gravity is real. "
Stephen Curry isn’t playing and Warriors are still favored in any matchup.

"If you want to cherry pick whatever sample size you want that fits your narrative as ""clutch"" sure. If you want to use the standard defined clutch sample size people use of ""a 5 point game within 5 minutes""......then unfortunately things don't look so great for the Kobe stans.   Kobe Bryatn in the standard definition of playoff crunchtime is 91/238 from the field. That's a good ole 38%. From 3 he is 14/55 shooting.   As you can see there are many players ahead of him and many behind him.....which makes him meh. WE don't need to sit and pretend Kobe's hero ball of hijacking the offense to put up the contested shots he want led to this great offense. It led to meh offense. But all the Kobe fanboys want to talk about is his ""will to win!!!"" and how him always chucking up shots and often ignoring his teammates showed ""how competitive he was!!!"".

"This may feel like an unneeded defense since most rational basketball fans have curry in their top 3-4 players in the NBA right now, but over the past 3-4 seasons I there hasn't been anyone (Westbrook, Harden, or Durant) better or more essential to their teams than 1a LeBron and 1b Curry.   2014/2015 Curry  -23.8ppg/7.7ast/4.3reb on 49%/44%/91.5% .64 TS% Curry is the best player on the best team, beats LeBron in the finals (LeBron Leads the series in points, assists, rebounds, Kyrie and love injured) -Loses finals MVP to Andre Iguodala for his stellar defense on LeBron (See stats listed above)   2015/2016 Curry -30.1ppg/6.7ast/5.4reb on 50%/45%/90% .67 TS% -Takes 11 threes per game and hits 50% of shots over 28 feet  -Leads league in steals (subjective to the great defense the warriors had but aren't all defensive stats)  -First unanimous mvp (Shaq and LeBron should've had this before him but it makes this look better so I'm adding it)  -Best player on the winningest regular season team of all time   Here's where the argument comes into play for some reason, the warriors defeat the thunder coming back from down 3-1, then go on to lose to the cavs after a 3-1 lead. I'm not one to use injuries as an excuse but it helps me in this argument so I will anyways. All throughout the 2016/2017 season Curry is regarded as the second best player in the league behind LeBron nagged by an ankle injury to the centerpiece of the statistically greatest team of all time the Warriors lose as many games as they do in the playoffs in the regular season.   *KD JOINS THE WARRIORS*   2016/2017 Curry https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/  2017/2018 Curry  -26.4ppg/6ast/5/reb on 50%/42%/92% with one of the highest TS% of all time "
"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/  this is relevant every single year. if he sinks 2 more baskets in 2016 game 7, we'd call him ""the best player on the planet"". for me personally, he's done enough. he's not as big as lebron and cannot be the post presence that he is, but he's a better shooter, passer, has better handles, impacts his teammates in a greater way, is more coachable, and is more versatile in that you don't have to build your team in a certain way with steph to be successful.   also i really hate how the comments are literally all ""this is great"" and like no substance at all otherwise. if you think it's great and have no other thoughts, upvote it."

"You people and your audacity to say that I “don’t know any NBA players that played before 2008” or that I’m a “bandwagoner” is amazing. Bring up the fact that I’m a teenager all you want, morons. I’ve been studying the NBA since I was a little kid and My knowledge of the history of this league is miles ahead of you. You think I don’t know who Brent Barry is??? How laughable. I could name the entire roster of the 1974 Cleveland Cavaliers if I wanted to. I could name the statistical leaders of every category in the 1964 NBA season off the top of my head. You people probably started following the league once Stephen Curry became big, yet you try to paint me as the uninformed one."

Stephen Curry is a good basketball player. Also everyone is injured. Everyone
"Space. KD is excellent, but nobody's presence of merely being on a basketball court creates more space for his teammates than one Wardell Stephen Curry. I believe it was Kerr that talked about how defenses have to do more to gameplan for steph than they did against MJ because of how much more of the court you have to actually defend steph at. KD is terrifying, but if he's pulling up from 5 feet behind the line, you can live with that for the most part. You can't let steph do that. Throw in picks and the space they create.. any miscommunication or hesitation from defenders results in easy looks because of his shooting and bbiq.   Edit: found the link. Kerr's comments should answer your question pretty well. https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2717120-steve-kerr-stephen-currys-impact-on-opposing-ds-greater-than-michael-jordans.amp.html"
1. LeBron James 2. Dirk Nowitzki 3. Chris Paul 4. Dwyane Wade 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry  I think after that it remains to be seen who else makes the cut.
"Jokic wasnt as aggressive as it resulted..  most of his shots were in the 2nd half getting towns in foul trouble which was superb.  He shot horribly tho.  This game belonged to Devin ""literally stephen curry"" Harris and Jamal Murray and their ability to shoot the 3."
"If Stephen Curry was a plus defender, maybe he wouldn't have blown a 3-1 lead."

" I don't see this working.   Here's why: Like in your idea, imagine there's no max salary, LeBron (Or LeBron-esque player) makes 60/70/80 mil a year for 4 years off of his rookie contract. The same is true to an extent for LeBron's friend's Daniel Wade and Jimmy Bosh, they're also making absurd money since they're objectively worth that much to their respective teams. And since they take up most of the hard cap, the teams they play for don't have salary flexibility to sign other good players and LeBron, Wade and Bosh continually lose in the playoffs to more balanced teams for years. After their 4 year phat contract ends, it comes to a point that they have a mountain of cash but decide that winning is more important than money. So they team up. Stephen A on 1st Take screams a whole lot but the precedent is set and history repeats itself, teams that have a hope of attracting multiple star FAs collude to do so and as far as the others, it's either a tank race or being smart.   Reddit continues to lament that there's no parity in the league even though this season (and previous) has shown that reddit and the NBA fanbase as a whole have no idea what the future is. ***Show me one reddit post in 2012/2013/2014 that predicts that the .348 Golden State Warriors of 2011 would have 4 All-stars by 2016/2017 and be starting a dynasty. ONE.***  Abolishing the max doesn't take away any of the initiative out of the players' hands. If you're KD or LeBron and you've been in the league making stupid amounts of money but still no championship, 20/30 million off the table is no sacrifice. Do you really think LeBron would've stayed in Cleveland if they offered him 80-90% of the cap (absurd even in this scenario - there's simply no space and they would've been in luxury tax hell forever) but in return play with rookie scale G-league players and be bounced out of the playoffs every year? Do you?   Or is it a more likely scenario he takes 20-25% of the cap so he can team up with 2 other All-stars who are also so mind-numbingly rich that they also would be happy to take 20-25% and leave the rest off the table?  The disparity in competitiveness is not a result of the max salary, but teams mismanaging their talent, asset management, player evaluation, luck, injuries and some cities being more attractive than others which the NBA salary structure and CBA can't do shit about.   Ibaka over Harden.  Jonny Flynn and Rubio over Curry.  MKG over basketball players  I could go on and on on  edit: dates  "

"Not really in order other than maybe the top 3:  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Stephen Curry  Dwight Howard  Kobe Bryant  Dirk Nowitzki  Tim Duncan  Chris Paul  Dwyayne Wade  Melo? Kevin Love? I don't know who to put in the last spot tbh. Melo definitely was one of the best players in the league around the turn of the decade, but he doesn't have anything to show for it and he's hot garbage now. Kevin Love is pretty underrated imo. In Minnesota he was one of the better players in the league. Both of these players suffer from bad defense though.  Maybe Boogie or Anthony Davis or Kyrie or Westbrook or Harden or Kawhi. There's a lot of borderline guys that will definitely be on all 2010's team by the end of the decade.  Edit: LaMarcus Aldridge is also a great shout. I'd put him with Melo and KLove in contention for the last spot."

Kevin Durant was nominated for successfully using a large quantity of burner accounts to create a media narrative that somehow caught on that he is better than Stephen Curry. 
"Backcourt pairings with what I think are their collective peaks as a duo:  Bob Cousy/Bill Sharman - peak '57  Jerry West/Gail Goodrich - peak '72  Walt Frazier/Earl Monroe - this is a weird one because the Knicks were better with Monroe in the line-up but his best seasons either came with the Bullets or after Frazier had fallen off, so '73, I guess.  James Silas/George Gervin - peak '76  Gus Williams/Dennis Johnson - peak '79  Maurice Cheeks/Andrew Toney - peak '83  Derek Harper/Rolando Blackman - peak '87  Magic Johnson/Byron Scott - peak '88  Isiah Thomas/Joe Dumars - peak '90  Kevin Johnson/Jeff Hornacek - peak '90  Terry Porter/Clyde Drexler - peak '91  John Stockton/Jeff Hornacek - peak '97  Sam Cassell/Ray Allen - peak '01  Tony Parker/Manu Ginobili - peak '07  Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson - peak '15  These are probably the best pairings that I could think of (not necessarily off the top of my head) and one player in each group is either in a class with Harden and Paul or at least approaching it with them but no pairing has both players there (even in the season I used as their collective peak (oddly enough, for my money it might be Porter and Drexler).  Part of that is because more often than not, for a superstar backcourt to succeed they not only have to have complimentary traits but they also have to find the right balance between lead ball handler and off ball tendencies (ideally Steph Curry might be the most perfect guard for either role, he'd be amazing with any top 10 shooting guard).  Harden and Paul have not only found that balance on the court for the most part, but D'Antoni has also done an excellent job of staggering their minutes (something he's always been particularly good at but he has more wealth of across the board talent than he's had in years past).  So, basically, no pairing can really match Harden and Paul's individual production (which they've been able to maintain) and their on court synergy."

"Thank you.  Warriors ball movement allow Stephen Curry to never take long twos because of his gravity and ability space out and efficiency to become a triple threat, since they are guarding his three he can just shoot a hesi pull up jumper. "
"That's probably the only viable father/son duo to compare against Stockton, unless Austin Rivers comes up with 2000 steals.  And no, the two players named Wardell Stephen Curry are combined at around 2000 steals. Dell also has only 1909 career assists. Unless Steph can sling 9000 dimes and David Stockton doesn't add many, the Stocktons will remain untouched in that category."

Tell me why Stephen Curry only played 34 minutes a game?
None of this matters if Draymond Green plays in game 5.  They win the series in 5 games and nobody is talking about how Stephen Curry played an extremely grueling 34 minutes a game in the regular season.
Klay also plays next to Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry the second and third best players in the world. Put lilard next to lebron I’m sure his efficiency takes a jump as well. Klay is great and plays his role to a T but he isn’t better than lilard

"https://247sports.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/Bolt/warriors-assistant-coach-encourages-stephen-curry-sell-fouls-109538160  &gt;For the majority of his career, Golden State Warriors superstar has averaged around four to five free-throw attempts a game. This season however, Curry is averaging 9.4 free-throw attempts a game.  &gt; Assistant coach Bruce Fraser has encouraged Curry to work at “selling fouls.” That’s one big reason Houston guard James Harden averaged more than 10 free-throw attempts per game in each of the past three seasons, as he sought contact and convinced referees to call a foul.  &gt;Curry, no natural actor, is gradually learning the fine art of shouting when he takes a shot in traffic, or demonstratively reacting at the slightest nudge or bump.  &gt;“I’m not great at it,” he said. “My tendency, especially when I’m in space, is to just play basketball. And basketball to me is trying to score, not really looking to create contact and get the foul called.…  &gt;Fraser “has been really consistent with his message, because he thinks there are times I can kind of let the ref know what’s going on. But it’s hard for me to always be in that mind-set, because I’m trying to create space, get my shot off and play basketball the way I’ve played it my entire life.”"

"I liked Kerr's take even better.  “We know that James and Chris are two of the craftiest players in the league,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “If they drive and you want to stick your hand in the cookie jar, they’re going to grab your hand and pull on it and the ref is going to give them two free throws.”  https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/12/golden-state-warriors-houston-rockets-western-conference-finals-nba-playoffs-2018-game-1-james-harden-klay-thompson-chris-paul-stephen-curry-when-is-schedule/"

Warriors general manager Bob Myers kept Lacob from bringing a reduced offer to the negotiating table, but it was enough of a thing that Myers reassured Curry of the franchise’s commitment."

"Do not allow Stephen Curry to rest on Defense get him in the action to have to guard CP3 or Harden, Harden can take advantage more but he should be in the pick and roll defending more   DO NOT BALL WATCH when guarding Klay and Steph off the ball, that’s how those two always float into open space. Clamping down on that can decrease some of the Warriors easy offense.

" Those Clippers team weren't as bad as you think, they just badly under-performed in the playoffs. You'd think a team of Chris Paul, Deandre Jordan, Blake Griffin, and JJ Redick could make a deep playoff run but they couldn't. Their best chance was when they faced the Rockets, but they just collapsed in the end.   Stephen Curry is basically the engine of the Warrior's offense in Kerr's system, and deserve a lot of the credit for making the Warriors play so well. Also he has two MVPs over Chris Paul. "

"I will say that the Mark Jackson years showed a lot of promise. Most folks knew Stephen Curry was a great basketball player, especially after that 54 point breakout game in Madison Square Garden in  2013. David Lee, the Warriors' first all-star since Latrell Sprewell, was also considered to be the second best player on that team. Winning a playoff series and acquiring Andre Iguodala in the following offseason for less money than what the Kings offered was seen as a ""we arrived"" moment for Golden State as a free agency destination. At that point I expected they'd be up there with OKC and Memphis as a young up-and-coming team that could contend for the Finals. But MVP-level Curry? That was a surprise."
"I disagree with this quite a bit. Lebron was definitely not finals MVP. Stephen Curry was the best player in this series, and Iguodala may have been 2nd best. Lebron shot 47 TS%, which is awful, and when a player is scoring that inefficiently, they're not helping the team a ton with their possessions, no matter what narrative people try to throw on that series.  I think the reason the series was deceptively close is because Golden State wasn't ready for the big stage. The team CHOKED hard. Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barneds and Andrew Bogut were all big time non factors. If Curry and Iguodala didn't show up, they probably would have lost. Curry was the only player in the starting lineup with a TS% above the league average for the series. I think Klay and Draymond each gave them 1 big game and then 5 small games for the series.    The other big thing is that Golden State got murdered inside. Mozgov averaged 14 pts/7.5 rebs and Tristan Thompson averaged 10 pts/13 rebs. Thompson and Mozgov were the only guys with positive net ratings (Lebron was neutral).   Golden State wasn't great in that finals and I think a healthy Bulls team would have beaten them, and the Cavs definitely would have beaten them if Kyrie and Love didn't get injured that year. "

"Sorry guys, I did not get a paywall and I do not subscribe:  ""One of the many peculiar things about being a professional athlete is that your colleagues know exactly how much money you make.   In the 10 years that he’s been an NBA role player, Houston Rockets forward Luc Mbah a Moute has never been paid as much as his peers. He’s earned less in his entire career than James Harden earned this year alone. As a free agent last summer, he was on the open market longer than most players before he finally signed a one-year deal for the veteran’s minimum salary, the least that any NBA team could offer. “Everybody could’ve gotten him,” Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni said, “and we did.”   He’s been so useful that it has since become clear Mbah a Moute was deeply misvalued by the league. To put it very simply, when he’s on the court, his team is better. And yet D’Antoni can’t fault other teams if they couldn’t understand why. “To be honest with you,” he said, “I didn’t know it, either.”   And what exactly was it that he didn’t know about Mbah a Moute?  “That he’s one of the best players in the league,” D’Antoni said.   Which sounds like an odd thing to say about someone who averages 7.5 points per game coming off the bench. Except he’s precisely the sort of player the Rockets knew they would need against the team they knew they would need to beat.   The Rockets and Golden State Warriors have circled each other like sumo wrestlers all season long, and now they’re colliding in the Western Conference Finals, a series between dominant, intelligent, carefully built teams responsible for many of the stylistic innovations that have defined the modern NBA. The Warriors are the reigning champions eyeing a third title in four years. You may have heard something about them. But the Rockets were constructed specifically to beat the Warriors, and they established themselves as the biggest threat to their budding dynasty by winning the most games in the NBA this season. They became good enough that Golden State losing is at least theoretically possible now.  This is a matchup with valuable players, most valuable players like James Harden, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, and one player who is crucially valuable in his own quiet way: Luc Mbah a Moute.  Every decision in basketball is a reflection of what NBA teams value and why. Because they’re constrained by a salary cap from spending indiscriminately—this is not baseball—they have no choice but to find value in unexpected places. And they win championships by doing more with the same amount of money. The embarrassment of riches otherwise known as the Warriors, for example, only exist because Curry was on a bargain contract until this season, at which point Durant agreed to his own sweetheart discount.   But it has never been more imperative to chase value on the margins in this era of talent consolidation across the NBA. There is a premium on effective, affordable players, and stealing a niche player on a minimum deal can be as important as picking the right star player for a maximum salary.   There was a simple reason the Rockets targeted Mbah a Moute, a 6-foot-8 forward who could guard anyone, after they paired James Harden with Chris Paul last summer. It was almost entirely because they were obsessed with the Warriors. They didn’t need to crunch the numbers to know they would probably have to play Golden State on their way to an NBA title—this being the Rockets, they crunched the numbers anyway—and that meant it wasn’t enough for them to merely improve. They had to improve in a way that increased their chances against the Warriors.   They were convinced that Mbah a Moute could help. Golden State’s small lineups feast on mismatches, but there is no team capable of starving them like the Rockets. And that’s by design. Houston can surround Harden and Paul with the versatile, interchangeable players required to switch on defense and survive against the Warriors—players like Mbah a Moute. In two games against Golden State, Mbah a Moute was positional silly putty. He defended Klay Thompson on 33 possessions, Durant for 23 possessions and Curry for 13 possessions, according to NBA tracking data.   Mbah a Moute, a Cameroonian who went to UCLA and bounced around five teams in five years before this season, was secretly good at lots of little things for a long time until those very things made him valuable.   He moved the ball, spaced the floor and was perfectly happy to guard the other team’s leading scorer. But one reason he was overlooked is that he did not shoot. He was good at not shooting, but not shooting wasn’t an option in Houston, where he’s been encouraged to shoot more than ever. “People thought I wasn’t a good shooter,” said Mbah a Moute, who is shooting 36% on 3-pointers this year, “but it’s because I was never really in a position where I could shoot.”  Houston saw the potential in Mbah a Moute that other teams ignored. It was not an accident that he signed there when he could have signed anywhere. “No, no, no—that one we went after hard,” D’Antoni said.  Rockets executives were on the phone with Mbah a Moute and his agent every day until he agreed to a deal. As he called around the league, general manager Daryl Morey heard so much praise about Mbah a Moute from coaches, executives and former teammates like Paul that he actually got worried. “It was almost too much raving,” he said. “I was, like, it can’t all be this good. It’s been even better.”  Mbah a Moute felt the same way as the Rockets. He was a little baffled at how badly they wanted him, especially because they already had P.J. Tucker, another undervalued wing player they prioritized last off-season.   “You just signed P.J.,” he said, “and I think we do the same thing?”  But what Houston realized was that it couldn’t have enough players like Tucker and Mbah a Moute.   “That made sense to me,” Mbah a Moute said. “I felt I could be a complementary piece of the puzzle.”   He was a positionless player before position became a dirty word, and when the game evolved, he took advantage of the ideas that have reshaped the league. Mbah a Moute was suddenly a market inefficiency. What he did was in high demand, and yet he was still available for cheap. That was all the incentive the Rockets needed to pursue him.   It worked out spectacularly well.  The Rockets set a franchise record for wins in a season. Their offense was more explosive than last year’s, when it was one of the most explosive of all-time. Their defense went from mediocre to elite under the influence of Paul, Tucker and Mbah a Moute, whose defensive rating was the lowest on the team.  He now finds himself in line for a richer contract because it turned out that D’Antoni calling him one of the league’s best players was positively D’Antonian: It may have sounded wrong, maybe even ridiculous, until it was right.  In fact, of the hundreds of player combinations that logged more than 1,000 minutes together, the Rockets had the single most productive two-man lineup in the NBA, a duo with a better net rating than even Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.  This pair that annihilated other teams: the likely most valuable player James Harden and Luc Mbah a Moute."""
"Drafted Draymond Green, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson.  Hired Steve Kerr.  Won a championship.  KD wanted to be here.    Shit on KD all you want but don't slight the org for ""buying rings""."
"I don't think you understand the situation properly.  Klay can take the extra $50 million and stay in the same location on the same team with the same teammates.  The only difference is that it saves the owners money in luxury tax.  **EDIT- From below:**   The 18-19 salary cap is projected at $101M at this point in time, let's call the 19-20 cap $110M.  Let's also assume the Dubs are going to resign Durant and he's not going to take as much of paycut like he said (say roughly 30M)  19-20 Season currently on the books:    | Player             | 2019-20        | |--------------------|----------------| | Stephen   Curry    | $40,231,758    | | Kevin   Durant     | ***30,000,000*** | | Klay   Thompson    | ??????         | | Draymond   Green   | $18,539,130    | | Andre   Iguodala   | $17,185,185    | | Shaun   Livingston | $7,692,308     | | Damian Jones | $2,305,057   |  With or without Klay, they're already over the salary cap and only have 6 players on the payroll.  They can go over the cap as far as they want to re-sign Klay, so they have no reason to drop him.  Then they have to fill out the other spaces on the roster regardless."
"Someone else asked a similar question, here’s my copy-pasted answer to them:  ***  I never said they don’t play more fundamentally sound, I said they aren’t as fundamentally sound:   &gt;Female ballers **tend to be** more fundamentally sound than their male counterparts  Honestly this isn't true  ***  Just because WNBA players **play more** fundamentally sound style of basketball than the NBA doesn’t mean they players **are** more fundamentally sound. That’s my whole point. I explained why their play style is more fundamentally sound, and then I explained how despite that, in reality they **aren’t** actually more fundamentally sound when you factor how different a game they play compared to men.   Off the top of my head an analogy I have to offer is Joe Ingles and Steph Curry. This season Joe Ingles shot a higher percentage (44.0%) than Steph Curry (42.3%) from three. But it’s not just as simple as saying “well Joe Ingles shot better so therefore this season he was a better three point shooter than Stephen Curry”. Just like the with WNBA players vs. NBA players, you have to consider the play style in context. Curry shot way more attempts, and had way more pull-ups and harder, further shots than Ingles who took more spot ups than Curry.   Basically, just because Ingles shot a higher percentage, doesn’t mean he was a better shooter than Curry this season. Just like how even though WNBA players play more fundamentally sound, doesn’t mean they are. "
"The article is behind a paywall so:  “Klay Thompson’s professed dedication to the Warriors and the Bay Area isn’t just words. He said he wants to stay and he’s already taking the steps to do so.  According to multiple sources, Thompson and the Warriors have already engaged in discussions regarding a contract extension. If the sides agree this offseason, Thompson would not hit the free-agent market for up to another five years.  Signing an extension would significantly decrease the maximum Thompson could make — and save the Warriors millions in luxury tax penalties.  The most he could get in the first year of an extension is a 120 percent raise. With the highest annual increases allowed, that would put Thompson’s extension at four years and just over $102 million. Add the $18.9 million he is due to make in 2018-19 and Thompson is looking at a maximum five-year salary of $121 million should he sign an extension.  If Thompson were to play out his contract and sign a new deal with the Warriors before the 2019-20 season, the maximum he would be eligible for — based on current salary-cap projections — is five years, $188 million.   However, Thompson probably understands that the maximum is not really on the table. The Warriors would almost be forced to let him walk if he demanded a new deal averaging $37.6 million per year since Stephen Curry and, presumably, Kevin Durant would be making the maximum. Three maximum salaries — for players in their 30s — and luxury-tax penalties figure to be too high even for the Warriors.  However, if Thompson became a free agent and went elsewhere, he could sign up to a four-year deal worth $139 million. Adding next year’s salary and that’s $158 million he could make over five years.  The NBA rumor mill has the Philadelphia 76ers interested in Thompson, who would seem to be the missing piece for the burgeoning franchise. The Los Angeles Lakers are an obvious match for the SoCal kid. Several teams could use Thompson, which is why there is little doubt he could get the four-year max if he hits the free agent market.  But Thompson wants to remain a Warrior. And he has proven that by engaging in discussions that could leave at least $30 million on the table (over five years) to remain in the Bay through his prime.  “It would be hard for me to envision going anywhere else,” Thompson said in a profile by Bleacher Report.  What’s more, two sources said talks have included Thompson taking an extension with an average of around $23 million a year — which would come out to about four years, $92 million, nearly $50 million less than he could get on the open market — and puts his five-year total at $111 million.  The final numbers won’t be, and can’t be known until July as Durant’s contract status will impact Thompson’s extension. Of course, there is no guarantee the sides reach an agreement this summer.  But if Thompson does sign an extension, it would be his second consecutive team-friendly contract. Thompson signed a four-year, $69 million extension in 2014. That figure was an expectation of what his maximum would be under the projected salary cap. So when the cap turned out higher, Thompson was locked in, missing out on the four years, $73 million extension he could have gotten.  Thompson has said he cares more about his happiness than the extra money, and he is happy here. While many expected Thompson to want out of the Warriors, where at best he is No. 3, he sees the franchise as a place to spend his entire career.  The choice between $150 million in a place he doesn’t know or $110 million in a place he knows he loves — it isn’t that hard for Thompson, those close to him say. In the end, he is still set for life financially. And he still has a lucrative deal with China-based shoe company Anta, and other endorsements such as Chocolate Milk and Body Armor, to supplement his NBA salary.  Why not just play it out as a free agent and re-sign with the Warriors for more money, even if it’s not the max? No doubt, Thompson and the Warriors could find a number that is greater than $102 million but still below the max.   But Thompson hasn’t had a track record of prioritizing squeezing every dollar he can. Plus, he doesn’t really want a prolonged or contentious negotiation, or the stress that comes with his wealth of options.  Thompson likes peace. He likes easy. He likes what he has. An extension would get all this done, help the team and keep this train rolling.”"
"From the article:  &gt;The most he could get in the first year of an extension is a 120 percent raise. With the highest annual increases allowed, that would put Thompson’s extension at four years and just over $102 million. Add the $18.9 million he is due to make in 2018-19 and Thompson is looking at a maximum five-year salary of $121 million should he sign an extension.  &gt;If Thompson were to play out his contract and sign a new deal with the Warriors before the 2019-20 season, the maximum he would be eligible for — based on current salary-cap projections — is five years, $188 million.   &gt;However, Thompson probably understands that the maximum is not really on the table. The Warriors would almost be forced to let him walk if he demanded a new deal averaging $37.6 million per year since Stephen Curry and, presumably, Kevin Durant would be making the maximum. Three maximum salaries — for players in their 30s — and luxury-tax penalties figure to be too high even for the Warriors.  &gt;However, if Thompson became a free agent and went elsewhere, he could sign up to a four-year deal worth $139 million. Adding next year’s salary and that’s $158 million he could make over five years.  Further:  &gt;What’s more, two sources said talks have included Thompson taking an extension with an average of around $23 million a year — which would come out to about four years, $92 million, nearly $50 million less than he could get on the open market — and puts his five-year total at $111 million.  &gt;The final numbers won’t be, and can’t be known until July as Durant’s contract status will impact Thompson’s extension. Of course, there is no guarantee the sides reach an agreement this summer.  &gt;But if Thompson does sign an extension, it would be his second consecutive team-friendly contract. Thompson signed a four-year, $69 million extension in 2014. That figure was an expectation of what his maximum would be under the projected salary cap. So when the cap turned out higher, Thompson was locked in, missing out on the four years, $73 million extension he could have gotten.  Warriors don’t give out NTC's, but if Klay does this he definitely needs to demand one. "

"I like Stephen Curry. He’s my favorite basketball player.  When Stephen Curry makes a three-pointer, I think “yes.”  When Stephen Curry misses a three-pointer, I think “no.”"
- Steve Kerr is an overrated coach - James Harden and Kevin Durant  have caught up and/or eclipsed kobe as a player  -wilt chamberlain bill Russell  and most players that played before the 80’s shouldn’t be considered greats because  of the lackluster competition  - Stephen Curry is the greatest point guard of all time not named magic Johnson  
"I never said they don’t play more fundamentally sound, I said they aren’t as fundamentally sound:   &gt;Female ballers **tend to be** more fundamentally sound than their male counterparts  Honestly this isn't true  ***  Just because WNBA players **play more** fundamentally sound style of basketball than the NBA doesn’t mean they players **are** more fundamentally sound. That’s my whole point. I explained why their play style is more fundamentally sound, and then I explained how despite that, in reality they **aren’t** actually more fundamentally sound when you factor how different a game they play compared to men.   Off the top of my head an analogy I have to offer is Joe Ingles and Steph Curry. This season Joe Ingles shot a higher percentage (44.0%) than Steph Curry (42.3%) from three. But it’s not just as simple as saying “well Joe Ingles shot better so therefore this season he was a better three point shooter than Stephen Curry”. Just like the with WNBA players vs. NBA players, you have to consider the play style in context. Curry shot way more attempts, and had way more pull-ups and harder, further shots than Ingles who took more spot ups than Curry.   Basically, just because Ingles shot a higher percentage, doesn’t mean he was a better shooter than Curry this season. Just like how even though WNBA players play more fundamentally sound, doesn’t mean they are. "
"The only reason I root for the warriors is because of Stephen Curry, my favorite player ever. If he got traded to the Cavs tomorrow, the Cleveland fanbase would be one richer "
"Regular season awards still go to whoever did best in the regular season.   This also reminds me of the year Tyreke Evans won ROY over Stephen Curry. Tyreke had the better year overall, but Curry progressively got better month to month. By the end of the year Curry was looking like the better player."
"Sure did. Played a whole bunch of different sports growing up that were way more physical than basketball too. Shit talking is a part of the game and sports in general. But every coach I have ever had has beaten it into their players' heads that when the game is over, you respect your opponents. You shake hands and say good game even if a few minutes ago you nearly came to fists.  That and everyone laughs at the guy talking shit on the losing team, especially if the score/series is a significant margin against them.  Edit: [For the people downvoting me:](https://theundefeated.com/features/lebron-james-and-trash-talk/)  &gt;The first unwritten rule in trash\-talking is that whatever happens on the court stays there.   &gt;   &gt;“Trash\-talking is part of the game,” Golden State Warriors guard  Stephen Curry said. “You have to give it. You have to be able to take  it. It’s just that you don’t want to see it ever cross the line and  become personal, because the game of basketball is never that serious in  regards to disrespecting people. **So you have to leave it on the floor.**”"
"&gt; That’s arrogance to you?  Never said it was.  But its definitely multiple ""clap backs"" and pot-stirring.  &gt; I’m sure you’ll be the first to recognize that Simmons saying that MO other rookie caught his eye was more disrespectful, right?  Not at all.  He said no rookie caught his eye because he focuses on watching Top 5 players and not his peers.  The quote:  &gt; ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  Mitchell standing up for Ben is cool tho and indicates there's no actual beef."

There’s no argument that KD is a better shooter than Stephen Curry
"So the warrior, arguably the best team in the league.  Let me lay down some facts on you.  There are two rounds of 30 picks in the NBA Draft. 60 total picks.  The undrafted players count as being picked +60  Quinn Cook / 2015 Draft / undrafted Chris Boucher / 2017 Draft / undrafted JaVale McGee / 2008 Draft / 18th overall David West / 2003 Draft / 18th overall Zaza Pachulia / 2003 Draft / 42nd overall Nick Young / 2007 Draft / 16th overall Shaun Livingston / 2004 / 4th overall Andre Iguodala / 2004 / 9th overall Kevin Durant / 2007 / 2nd overall Jordan Bell / 2017 / 38th overall Draymond Green / 2012 / 35th overall Kevon Looney / 2015 / 30th overall Klay Thompson / 2011 / 11th overall Stephen Curry / 2009 / 7th overall  If you were to take the average picks of the 16 players on the warriors lineup you end up with 26.125.  The average pick on their roster is 26th in the Draft, solidly debunking your “have to have the best draft picks to make a solid team theory.”  If the warriors have proven anything at all it’s that you don’t need the best picks to be the best. You just need a group of guys to buy into the mentality of the organization. To believe in one another as well as having confidence in their own games. Look to pass first score second, which at times even backfires on the warriors because they make one too many passes in my mind. Instead of a strong finish at the rim to draw a foul.  There are a ton of solid players out there that are rookies from last year that are better than fultz and lonzo yet they were picked 1 and 2.  It’s not about media hype, or quality of draft picks. It’s about acquiring players that work well together. "
"Please go away. You have no idea how bad the bench and offence was in the first part of the season and how Kyrie carried us. He was playing almost like a young Steph Curry.

"If Kevin Durant slept with Ayesha Curry, what would the ramifications be?  I see this going one of two ways. Let's work through both scenarios.  First, Steph comes home from a long trip to the local Foot Locker. He's greeted to the sight of an elongated, legless, carnivorous reptile plowing his wife in the pastry maker. That's when he realizes, just as the prophecies foretold, Stephen Curry is a cuckold prince. He grabs his pacifier, curls up into a ball, and weeps. At that moment, Lebron James enters the Curry household, and then begins to spoon his son to sleep. The rest of the NBA is none the wiser.  In the second scenario, Stooph does not come home that night. When he next sees Ayesha, she tells him everything. Steph arrives at practice early the next day. When he enters the locker room, its just him and the servant.  ""You been suckin' them toes, boy?"" Stooph says.  The servant approaches. They kiss cheeks.  KD enters Bob Myers office.  He shouts, ""Myuhhh wife!"" while dressed as a crude recreation of Sacha Baron Cohen's character Borat, from the surprise 2006 blockbuster, Borat!

This year Lowe still made him one of his 8 ""locks"" for East All-Stars.   Lowry has been top 10 in RPM for the last 3 years. Kyle Lowry is absolutely a top 15 player.  NBARank going into 16/17 &gt;Insider profile: For all the talk of ""skinny Lowry,"" he was more or less the same player as he was in the second half of 2013-14 and the first half of 2014-15 throughout a single campaign. The result was the best full season of Lowry's career, a second consecutive All-Star start, an appearance on the All-NBA third team and a spot on the USA team that won gold in Rio. Only three point guards (and nine players total) used more than a quarter of their team's plays with true shooting percentages of .570 or better: Lowry, MVP Stephen Curry and Chris Paul. That's the company Lowry has kept recently, ranking as a top-10 player by most all-in-one value stats. "

"i'm happy about bobby knight and donny, but when you watch this team play you can tell steph is not the best passer.  he turns it over too much, and makes wild, bonehead throws across the court. one sec, i'm going to go find the potential assist to bad pass turnover ratio for the whole GSW squad and list them in order:  POTENTIAL ASSIST/BAD PASS TO RATIO GSW:  1. Quinn Cook: 96 (holy crap)  2. Kevon Looney: 16.25  3.  Patrick McCaw: 13.  OK.  Obviously this suffers a little bit from SmallSampleSize-Itis.  I'll rerun this but filter by Klay's total passes per game.  You only get counted if you pass as much as or more times than Klay.

We have a terrible track record in the playoffs. It's not all his fault but it's been evident for some time that Casey is just not a championship-caliber coach.      The real question is how much more another coach can squeeze out of this group. It's not a Mark Jackson-Steve Kerr situation where you have a Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green core at ages 25/23/23. DeMar/Kyle/Serge are 29/32/unknown.

That's like saying there's no way Eric Bledsoe could have benched X because just look at Stephen Curry."
And this is a lie. I don’t know where you got that from but if rovell says he’s paying nearly 12% then he’s laying the 12.   http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-salary-taxes-nba-2017-9
I'll delete my account if Stephen Curry is more accurate from the half-court line than Andre Drummond is at making free throws.  AGAIN!
"Yeah, I think you Philly fans would know a lot more about his performance overall than I possibly could and like I said he does really have a great reputation. I'm just talking more from the perspective of that one series, even more specifically I'm talking about that first game.  That being said, I don't think it's a matter of experience. A schmuck like Stephen A Smith could have done better with the defensive matchups.   There are certain things a coach shouldn't have to learn. The Reddick on Tatum assignment was one of those things.    In college, Tatum was in the 99th percentile for post-ISO plays. His ability to bully short white guys in the post is pretty much the entire the reason he was projected so high in the draft. He was a top 4 pick before anyone knew he could shoot 3s or defend.   It's not just that Reddick on Tatum is a bad idea, it's the exact matchup Tatum was hoping to get by forcing switches, it was probably even something Brad Stevens had spoken to him about and that our team game-planned to achieve.   Suddenly the mismatch is just given to us on a silver platter and Tatum doesn't even have to work for it.   Steve Kerr wouldn't put Curry on Lebron, Thibs wouldn't put KAT on Harden, Lue wouldn't put Love on Curry. There are matchups you just know to avoid.   "

The Pels and Spurs played the Warriors that didn’t have Stephen Curry. Food for thought.

"OP, I’m a lil confused on your team bc John Wall and De’Aaron Fox both use “o”, and “a” as vowels. In addition to Stephen Curry, Nené, and De’Aaron Fox all sharing “e” as a vowel. I’m probably missing something here on how either vowels work, or misinterpreted the guidelines you set. Would you mind explaining how that’s a valid lineup?"
"From February of 2017  &gt;""*Where do you see Kevin Durant's ceiling in the all-time NBA ranks?*"" --Sahith Vadada  &gt;Given that Durant's the same age now as Michael Jordan was when he won the first championship, it's probably still somewhat early to be putting a ceiling on him. That said, if we give Durant a median trajectory from here on out -- a few championships with the Warriors, but no more MVPs, because while he's in his prime he splits credit with Stephen Curry -- I don't think he could pass Kobe Bryant, who finished No. 11 in last year's all-time #NBArank voting. And he'd probably be behind Curry, too. So I think Durant may have a tough time getting any higher than about 13th.

"teams have been using the 3 as a weapon for a while and stephen curry really brought the pull up 3 and dribble combination 3 into the spotlight. However, I really don't see too many teams trying to replicate the type of 3's he's shooting.  My guess is that teams are still aiming to shoot more corner threes than the 3 off the pick and roll"

"1. Pacific Timezone.   2. Yes. I moderated the r/teenagers discord server for a period of about 6 months, during of which it had around 3k active users, and an extremely active community.     In addition, I moderated and currently moderate the r/halo server, which at it's peak contained 7k members and    was extremely active during the release of Halo 5: Forge. I took a break for school and have recently returned.     I also created and ran my own server, a sort of cousin to the r/teenagers. I eventually had life get in the way and    passed on ownership, it was extremely active during the time it was up.   3. I've slowly ramped back into my usual activity on Discord, and I have my phone on me virtually at all times. I typically am available if pinged for atleast 12 hours a day, and I actively check it often. I'd become a lot more active should I become a moderator, especially considering the fact I'd be able to talk basketball, lol.   4. The server doesn't appear to exist yet so I can't say if this would be something that would be a problem, but I've found minimal rules to best. As someone who has spent days moderating Discord servers, i've found the ones that communities work the best are ones where the rules are very basic, No slurs, no NSFW, no personal attacks etc. Discord moves so fast that things like shitposts can't exactly be moderated efficiently, and that also creates an awkward line between what is acceptable and not. The community needs to be able to breath, similar to how it does on the subreddit.    In addition, dedicated channels for games (think like, game threads) seems almost like a must. A general off topic channel as well, and maybe a meme channel.     I'd also like to explore having roles for each team - however it's worth noting that this could create a mess of colors as each role has it's own color.     Discord has really amped up their platform in the past two years, and there's tons of options being added. Bots that have unique features and that support the community are available, including automods that mute /unmute for targeted words or actions.   5. A Discord moderator is someone who should enforce the rules of the server. Removing spam, NSFW, or fixing conflicts. They shouldn't feel the need to act above anyone, and should be, in my opinion, active top members of the community, who look to ensure it runs and functions smoothly. They need to be able to admit mistakes and want to moderate to create a better server, more than just for a special role or power to ban people they don't like.     They can mute troublesome members, ban spammers, and ensure the community is safe, and fun. They    shouldn't feel the need to show their power in every conversation that takes place.   6. I've been active on r/nba for around two years now. I'm primarily pretty casual, but enjoy posting PGT from time to time and discussing basketball. I feel like I'd be a good addition because of my experience moderating Discord - and my love and passion for the NBA and everything r/nba is. As great as the NBA is, r/nba really makes it for me. It's where to find the news, memes, and some good original content. While it can be unruly at times, that is simply the nature of the beast.   7. My favorite memory was when Stephen Curry drained the three pointer against Oklahoma in 2016. I grew up in Seattle, and attended one of their last games here. There was something so satisfying about that shot, and after about a 7 year absence I got back into basketball, and the NBA. It was such a hype moment.   I believe I have a comfortable balance between memey and serious, and I think I'd be able to fit in and be a good moderator in the community. I really don't take myself that extra seriously, and this is typically good for me when I'm communicating with people, although this mod app might come as serious, I am a super casual and laid back person. I simply want to chat basketball with people, and make sure the community runs and functions well, keeping it free of any problems.   I have much experience in moderating Discord, as I used it as my main social outlet for the better part of two years. I've moderator some small servers in between I didn't list, and made a few for other smaller groups I'm in. I'd love the chance to moderate the Discord for my favorite subreddit.  Thank you for your consideration, and sorry for being a bandwagon Warriors fan :)  "
"It was fourth quarter, with less than ten seconds left and Golden State was down by 2. T h e arena was so loud, that Steph couldn’t hear his own thoughts.  He calmly walked the ball up the court and saw Russell waiting for him at the half court line, watching him intently with his eyes. Once Steph reached half court, he quickly passed the ball to Kevin and once Kevin touched the ball, every fan in the arena instantly booed.  ""CUPCAKE! CUPCAKE!” everyone chanted in the stands. Kevin calmly dribbled the ball and watched as his former teammate, Andre Roberson, checked him.  After passing the ball, Steph ran straight through the lane and took a screen from Draymond. Russell bumped into Draymond and then hurriedly moved to catch up to Steph, but this was enough space to give the sharpshooter room.  Kevin dribbled the ball to the top of the key and Andre followed. He gave him a quick in and out with the ball and then passed it to Steph once he saw him open. Steph caught the ball in the corner behind the three point line and quickly released it in the air. Russell moved to contest the shot, but was too late.  The clock was running down as the ball sailed to the basket. Steph had landed and watched as the ball moved in the air. He closed his eyes and silently prayed that the ball would sink in the net. When he heard the buzzer go off, he opened his eyes and saw the ball rattle in the hoop. The whole Warriors bench stood and watched. BUZZZZZ!!!!!  ""WOOOOO!!!!!” Steph yelled excitedly. He raised his arms in the air as Thunder fans booed. The team was running onto the floor to hug him and celebrate the game winner. Thunder players were shaking their heads at the sudden lost and standing in disbelief. Steph continued to stand confidently as Kevin was the first to reach him. He put his forehead to Steph’s and yelled.  “YEAH!” Kevin yelled out loud. He brought a hand to Steph’s head and smiled. Steph looked in his eyes and smiled, too. At that moment, Steph focused solely on Kevin and wanted nothing more than to kiss him. Kevin was leaning close to him, so Steph leaned up and kissed him.  It went silent in the arena, every fan either stopped cheering or booing and watched as Stephen Curry kissed Kevin Durant. "
Stephen Curry
I've only been really watching since 2014 tbh so heres my list in order:   Kyrie Irving   Kawhi Leonard   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   LeBron James
"Thinking he's the 2nd best player in the league is very defensible, but so is thinking Steph is better. Steph's best season is better than KD's best season. Steph's plus minus has been better than KD's the last two seasons. Steph also makes his teammates shoot much better when he's on the court.   [This article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/) is from last year, but it illustrates how impactful Steph is. FWIW, he was better this season when he played.  They are roughly equivalently efficient scorers, Steph is the much better shooter and playmaker, but Durant is the much better defender and rebounder.  You can easily make the case that Steph has been the league's second best player from 2015-now. Of course, you can also easily make the case for Durant.  Regardless, it's closer than you're giving it credit for."
"Stephen Curry. No one expected him to be this good. Came out of nowhere.  All the other greats, it was somewhat predicted that they would end up to be a first ballot HOFer."

"I used regular season only cuz point was to more or less show which players protect their 3-point percentage more by deciding not to put up 3's. In the playoffs, that kind of goes out the window.   Players | Attempts | Made -------|--------|---- Stephen Curry | 15 | 1 Carmelo Anthony | 3 | 0 Dwyane Wade | 9 | 0 LeBron James | 4 | 0 John Wall | 6 | 0 Dirk Nowitzki | 2 | 0 Chris Paul | 3 | 0 Paul George | 6 | 0 Russell Westbrook | 2 | 0 James Harden | 7 | 0 Kyrie Irving | 1 | 0 Giannis Antetokounmpo | 1 | 0 Damian Lillard | 2 | 0   Anthony Davis | 1 | 0 Kevin Durant | 6 | 0 Kawhi Leonard | 0 | 0  So yeah... not really a huge game-changer.

"The biggest knock on Kobe is his finals performance. He had a below league average scoring efficiency in all of his NBA Finals except 2002 (1/7). Comparatively, someone like Stephen Curry has had above league average scoring efficiency in 4/4 finals.  It’s cool he had good moments in the easier rounds, but he was carried hard in the finals, and with his scoring efficiency it’s pretty clear the finals mvps aren’t accurate as to who the best player on the Lakers was for those series.   Because he came up small in the finals almost every time, I think he belongs more at the kiddie table and not the adult table with Steph and Lebron at Thanksgiving.   2000 Finals: Kobe 41.1 TS%/-20 net rating, Shaq 57.6 TS%/+9 net rating  2001 Finals: Kobe 50.1 TS%/+1 net rating, Shaq 57.5 TS%/+14 net rating  2002 Finals: Kobe 62.3 TS%/+12 net rating, Shaq 63.6 TS%/+24 net rating  2004 Finals: Kobe 46.6 TS%/-18 net rating, Shaq 61.5 TS%/+5 net rating  2008 Finals: Kobe 50.5 TS%/-13 net rating, Pau Gasol 57.2 TS%/0 net rating.  2009 Finals: Kobe 52.5 TS%/+13 net rating, Pau Gasol 64.7 TS%/+33 net rating.  2010 Finals: 52.8 TS%/+9 net rating, Pau Gasol 55.6 TS%/+21 net rating."

they saw how much the duties of becoming the mvp had on stephen curry during the playoffs and im sure warriors head office complained about this and so they changed it to 2 weeks after the originally scheduled finals (if all series went to game 7s)      i personally think its a good thing. but it should be a few days after the finals and also shift dates just like the finals date shifted since teams were ready to play

[sim888] Detail: What the Warriors should be doing here is to form a ring around Stephen Curry so he can get an open shot.
"You are right about him getting crucified, but he was crucified by the garbage hot take shows, and if JR had made a shot that won game 1, the storyline was going to be KD playing badly. Stephen A, and all the talking heads on ESPN said as much.   If you think it's BS, that's your right to think it, but I literally said KD/Curry/LBJ are held to different standards. KD and Curry's bad games canceled each other out for me, and Curry had two offensive explosions and one good game. KD had one offensive explosion and 2 efficient games which are good for him, but not considered great considering what KD/LBJ are considered capable of.   If you think I'm being too hard on KD, I don't know what to tell you. It's still softer than the standards LBJ is held to, and I'm ok with those standards. Those type of stats for LBJ in game 2 were criticized. "
"Dell Curry wasn't wrong: &gt;""We felt that Stephen would fit perfectly with a coach like Mike D’Antoni, playing that fast, up-and-down style. He loved the idea of playing at Madison Square Garden.”  They have that now with Golden State."
"Monta Ellis and Stephen Curry liked playing with each other too, after they got over the initial growing pains of getting used to each other and finding their roles. Unfortunately, it was still a bad fit. Fans loved Monta, and rightfully so, but trading him for Bogut was the right move for the franchise."
"Why are you reducing players down to picks? How about this:   Team A: Signed Lebron, had Kyrie Irving (2x All star, never played in playoffs, never made an All-NBA Team), Anthony Bennett (Biggest draft bust in NBA History), Andrew Wiggins (Never played a minute in the NBA). These are the 3 recent #1 Picks you mentioned. Won 33 games the previous year.  Team B: Signed KD, had Stephen Curry (3x All-Star 2xMVP, unanimous MVP, NBA Champion, 3x All-NBA Player), Klay Thompson (2X All-Star, 2X All-NBA Player, NBA Champion), Draymond Green (NBA All Star, All-NBA Player, All Defensive first team). Won 73 games the previous year, best in the history of the NBA.  Can you honestly say those teams are even remotely the same situation.  FYI I loved the warriors before KD signed, I loved what you guys were doing putting your team together, you just lucked into the weakest, softest MVP in league history who wanted the easy way out."

"The summer of 2016 told us to never dismiss anything when it comes to the Warriors and their ability to land a superstar.  The difference between then and now will be Golden State's inability to create space combined with the salary cap increasing only 1.9 percent. Two years ago, the Warriors were in position to sign Kevin Durant based on the cap increasing from $70 million to $94.1 million -- not to mention that Stephen Curry had a salary of $12 million and Harrison Barnes was set to be a free agent. If LeBron does decide he wants to join Golden State, the maneuvers won't be so simple.  Last June, Chris Paul notified the Clippers that he was not planning to sign with them as a free agent. Instead of the Clippers losing Paul for nothing, the point guard opted in to his $24.6 million contract and was sent to Houston for a package of players and draft picks. This scenario allowed the Rockets not to completely gut their roster to create cap space for Paul if he became a free agent.  For LeBron, the Paul scenario presents the best route if his desire is to play for the Warriors (or, possibly, the Rockets). When the season ends, James and his representatives can meet with the Cavs and let them know that he is not planning to return. Instead of losing James for nothing, Cleveland can take a proactive approach like the Clippers and ask James to opt into his $35.7 million contract (and waive his no-trade clause), with the understanding that he would be traded to a team like the Warriors. Of course, this scenario would need all three parties -- Cleveland, James and Golden State -- to agree.  The Warriors could put together a package that includes All-Star Draymond, wing Andre Iguodala and draft considerations. The Cavs would receive a package of players that would keep them afloat in the East. Keep in mind that if James leaves as a free agent, Cleveland will have limited options in free agency based on being right at the salary cap.   Curry,Klay,Durant, Lebron 🤯🤯😂  "
"Actually, [according to ESPN and Second Spectrum](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23526364/houston-rockets-target-stephen-curry-defense-evening-western-conference-finals), they targeted Curry 43 times in Games 1 and 2. Though only 28 were isolation plays."

He's big and good at basketball. I think people over value being able to jump high in a league dominated by shooting. It's much more important knowing when to jump and where to be. Just look at Stephen Curry -- undersized guard who can finish at the rim and get rebounds. I'd much rather go with Doncic.

That’s… not going to win that way.  -Q: Why not?  -ELLIS: It’s different when you’re trying to compare me and Stephen, when you’re trying to go back to when me and BD were playing, it’s a different situation.  You’ve got a nine-year veteran who’s been in the game, who understands the game, knows how to play the game, and he’s a big body…  You can’t put two small guys out there and try to play the 1 and the 2 when you’ve got big 2 guards in the league. You just can’t do it.  OK, yes, we’re going to move up and down fast, but eventually the game is going to slow down.  You can’t do it.&gt; "
Stephen Curry 
David west and Zaza pachulia come knocking on my door on a stormy night.  I answer... “Hello?” Zaza then replies “nothing eazy” and then him and d west step to the side. Stephen curry and Klay Thompson starting raining sniper bullets on my front door as javale mcgee and Kevin Durant starting dropping bombs on my roof. I ran to the back in the dark and there is draymond who stuns me by kicking me in the groin. Nick young comes to deliver the finishing blow but misses the shot. I stand up and run to my back door to be met with an ominous presence. It’s Steve Kerr. He tells me it’s better to just let them take over. He leads me to the back yard as Shaun Livingston does a turn around jumper and it’s the end.
Who is Stephen Curry I?  His dad as called Dell and named Wardell Stephen Curry.

"Holy shit this Warriors thread is insane...      &gt;No thanks, if it means giving up Barnes, Bogut, touches to Steph, chemistry concerns, defensive holes or any other potential problem then I am not on board. Why break up a team that has a great chance to win it all for a long time for something that may break it all. Whatever the front office does I'm on board they have shown they know what they're doing but to me this does not seem like a good move.  ...          &gt;Man, I hope it doesn't happen. Kd is one of the most dominant players in the league, teams should be dying to build around him.  &gt;I'm hesitant to believe these kinds of reports though. If I was the kind of talent KD is, I wouldnt even think about going somewhere else to be a #2. Typically athletes of that caliber are stupid competitive, that's why they get so good.      ...       &gt;I don't want anyone to leave I don't want anyone to come I want everything to stay as it is  ...      &gt;I'm still not sure about this idea. It's a massive risk (he's great but does he fit) with a massive cost (we'd have to give up at least Barnes, Andre, and likely Bogut or Festus).  ...       &gt;If it ain't broke, don't fix it  ...      &gt;KD is an amazing player but before barnes was injured it felt like this group has a potential next level we haven't seen yet. Would be a shame to break it up before.  ...      &gt;If KD leaves to go to a contender, will he receive the same kind of criticism Lebron did when he went to Miami? If not then perhaps that hate was more due to the whole ""Decision"" debacle then the actual leaving itself. Durant's image is spotless at the moment, so I wonder how public perception of him would change.  ...      &gt;Don't want him. Too big of a risk and who knows how he will handle it if he needs to become a role player. That dude takes too many shots.  ...      &gt;I don't want it. Don't want to get rid of HB, Iggy, Bogut. And want the team to stay built around Stephen Curry and let him be the superstar of the team. If KD comes he'll take that away..  ...      &gt;Having to part ways with Andre hurts more than HB  If only they knew..."
"Oh man. To be so dismissive of what he's already achieved with such a poor/injured squad surrounding him (until this season, but even then there were quite a few injuries) not only shows your ignorance, but also proves my point about how if he were on a better team (or a bigger market team) he'd be getting a lot more credit. He's top 3 to me because defensively he blows Stephen Curry out of the water. He's also undeniably better than James and Durant at defense now. On top of this, he put up more points per game and rebounds than any of them. Lebron is number one, that's not up for debate, but Davis can absolutely be called top 3 based off of this season."
"they're actually saying ""Stephen Curry"". it's hard to tell because it's usually pronounced ""Steven"", so it's understandable that you'd be confused!"

"Piggybacking for visibility. Here's what TK actually wrote:  &gt;2. The Warriors will not even think of breaking up of the Big Four this summer or into the future.  &gt;Are the Warriors still targeting New Orleans center Anthony Davis? Sure. Lacob and Myers love to circle the best names possible years in advance of their potential availability, and figure out how they might be able to land the biggest fish out there.  &gt;It used to be Kevin Durant. Now the Warriors’ biggest target is Davis, and they understand that their clearest way to get him was to sacrifice several big parts of their foundation — maybe Klay Thompson and/or Draymond Green — in a trade.  &gt;But the Warriors have also just won back-to-back titles, riding the backs of Durant, Stephen Curry and, yes, Draymond and Klay. Add in Andre Iguodala, and those are the guys who have made this dynasty possible and set the culture, and they’re all irreplaceable.  &gt;If the Warriors had lost to Houston in the conference finals? I think Warriors management would’ve been slightly more amenable to at least considering some big deal that would’ve taken apart their foundation to try to build another one.  &gt;But not now. Warriors management has always been clear: As long as they’re winning, they will do everything they can to keep the core together, and it would be crazy not to.  &gt;If anything, the Warriors are well down the path of signing Thompson to an extension this summer and could do the same with Green either this summer or next.  &gt;“All good things cost a lot,” Lacob told ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne. “We’re going to try to sign Klay and Draymond to extensions this summer. … We’ll do whatever we can to keep them.”  &gt;Just as a side note, here’s the count of Warriors titles, player by player in this era (counting only when the player was on the playoff roster for a title run):  &gt;3 — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Klay Thompson.  &gt;2 — Kevin Durant, Zaza Pachulia, David West, JaVale McGee, Patrick McCaw, Kevon Looney, Damian Jones, James Michael McAdoo.  &gt;1 — Harrison Barnes, Andrew Bogut, Leandro Barbosa, David Lee, Festus Ezeli, Ian Clark, Mo Speights, Nick Young, Quinn Cook, Matt Barnes, Justin Holiday, Brandon Rush, Jordan Bell.

"That's great and admirable, but not at all what we were discussing.

Do I hate lebron? Nope. I hate his followers though. I can’t believe that his followers go around calling warriors fans bandwagoners when Cleveland’s fan base was nothing without lebron.

"&gt;Golden State Warriors lead guard **Stephen Curry** already owns the franchise record for three-pointers made, attempted and free-throw percentage.   &gt;   &gt;Soon, he may be able to add assists to the list, too.   &gt;   &gt;At the moment, Curry is 628 helpers behind franchise legend and Hall-of-Fame floor general **Guy Rodgers** for the lead. Curry has only had more than 628 assists in a year once in his career, back in his breakout 2013-14 campaign when he averaged 8.5 of them nightly over 78 games played.   &gt;   &gt;If the two-time MVP is able to suit up in at least 70 contests next season, he’ll have to average nine assists per game to break the record by the end of the campaign. Definitely doable, especially as Curry will still have the likes of **Kevin Durant**, **Klay Thompson** and **Draymond Green** to distribute the ball to, as well as the fact there will be a certain behemoth joining the squad in **DeMarcus Cousins** who Curry will be eager to feed dimes to, as well.  this person doesn't watch Golden State basketball."

My inner Stephen Curry rebukes this stat
"&gt; Published on Apr 25, 2013 Stephen Curry and the guys have had some very impressive shooting displays during this season, the obvious one to point out at this point being the 65% of shots they just made from the field against the Nuggets in game 2. But, in my opinion, this still is the best instance of long range shooting a Warrior has shown off. An injured Chris Mullin, who had sprained his knee in round 1 against the Spurs, went through two workouts to get ready for the second game of round two at LA. Did it pay off or what!? Mully went for 41 points on 16 from 21 from the field, with 5 assists, to boot. Meanwhile, Magic Johnson, who had spent the majority of the first half finding his teammates, noticed that the game might slip out of the Lakers' hands and replied to Mullin's jumpers by attacking him nearly every time down the court. Magic was basically scoring at will, either he made a shot or the Warriors fouled him. His playoffs career-high (and the only 44/12/9 in playoffs since 1985) wasn't enough though as the Warriors pulled off the W on the road. May 8, 1991.  This description is almost too cute. "
Stephen Curry will start exactly 71 games.
Sure  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/1820880-stephen-curry-says-he-shaped-his-game-after-steve-nash-and-reggie-miller.amp.html
"I don't have an argument because there is no argument. Kevin Durant will never be respected as he made the biggest bitch move of all time and Stephen Curry is the reason the Warriors got to such a level in the first place, he is their most important player especially considering having him allows Durant to not be consistently doubled. These are facts, not an argument. Just cold hard facts, if somebody can't comprehend this, like you, they have 0 knowledge on the sport. "
"The 80’s and 90’s were full of talented 3 point shooters, many of which were shooting better than 35%. Stephen curry took more 3’s in the last 3 seasons than Larry Bird did his entire career, Bird was almost 40% career. Reggie Miller, Dale Ellis, Steve Kerr and many more were terribly underutilized. It’s painful to watch old games on NBATV and see so many shots taken less than a foot inside the arc.  Also, teams weren’t shooting 52% from inside the arc either. "
"Stephen Curry can't be one of the drafters for All-Stars because you can't do it 2 years in a row. I don't know how LeBron moving from the East to the West effects this rule.  EDIT: Its more likely they play on different teams. Lets say Giannis and KD are captains. Giannis had more votes than KD last year and given LeBron is leaving the East lets say he'll probably be 1st captain unless LeBron is eligible. Giannis would probably take LeBron and KD would take his teammate Steph. Even if KD drafts first, KD would probably go with his teammate Steph and Giannis would probably take LeBron."
"&gt; my brother went to OU. had to listen to an entire year about how this kid is Steph Curry. he gets to Summer League and his shot looks horrendeous and suddenly people are going ""wait, shit, uhh... no he's... STEVE NASH, yeah, that's it."" what?  Stephen Curry shot 32% from the field in summer league. He's getting compared to Steve Nash more because people are impressed with his court vision, not because he hasn't shot well. Trae shot better as a 19-20 year old in SL than Curry did as a 21-22 year old. "
&gt; What makes Trae Young great is that he is much closer to Steve Nash—like the best-case scenario of Trae Young is closer to Steve Nash than Steph Curry  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/07/13/trae-young-stephen-curry-comparison-nba-summer-league-hawks

"Shameless shoutout to myself: I found this thread because I was looking at my old comments by ""controversial"" and found some where I was making a case for Steph being a top player and had tons of people calling me crazy. So to those people from 5 years ago, suck it.   It's actually crazy though how much the league has changed in 5 years. Apparently there was a strong case for Tony Parker to be the 3rd best in the league!  Edit: This was an actual comment I responded to!   &gt;""Yeah, you're insane. Not for suggesting Parker or Rose, but Steph? Stephen Curry? Is there some other Steph I'm unaware of?""   GOTCHABITCH  Edit 2: I had lost a bet at the time which is why all my comments say that DWade is the best player to come out of the Chicagoland area, which at the time was a direct shot at DRose. I believe I said that DWade wouldn't put up 20 points in some playoff game and he did. I remember that I had something good for the loser too if I had won but I can't remember it now."

LeBron, KD, James Harden, Stephen Curry, CP3, Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, and time traveling peak Jordan, Kareem, Wilt, Bird and Magic all say fuck it. Let's sign 1 year contracts with the Wizards and play together for one year. They win all 82 games and the championship.  Then, they disperse and go their separate ways.  Under your logic, that team isn't very ""dominant"" because they only won one ring.  We don't need to know how many rings GSW will win with this team to know how dominant they were for the last two years. You have to compare the relative strength and talent of teams. You can't just look at rings."

"&gt;2016 curry was the greatest player of all time on the regular season any one who didnt vote for him was just straight hating  Probably the greatest offensive season yeah, but all around GOAT? Hell no. Jordan, Barkley, Shaq, Magic, and Kobe have all had better individual seasons than Curry at some point in time. Shit there's probably a lot of players I'm leaving off of there too.   Also thanks for all but admitting that the media doesn't hate Steph lmao.  &gt;Outside of this year he was far too inconsistent, didnt draw much fouls and didnt average 24 points didnt average 10 assists or rebounds,  Your standards are so fucked up it's ridiculous. Of course he doesn't average 10 rebounds or assists, that's not his fucking role, and he already plays on a team where the other starters are Stephen Curry and Kevin fucking Durant, not to mention that DeMarcus Cousins might join that here soon as well.  Also, when did it become some unwritten rule that superstars HAVE to average 24 points? You know there's more to being a superstar than scoring, right?   &gt;Trying to push your silly narrative that klay is a superstar to take away from curry shows how desperate you are.  Lol what? If anything you're pushing this silly narrative that Klay isn't a superstar to overrate Curry's accomplishments.   I'll tell you right now that Steph is a top 5 PG of all time, but he's had adequate help his entire career, and that's not to say that having adequate help makes you a bad player as you seem to think I'm saying, but his stats now really aren't as impressive as your making them about to be when they're contextualized.   &gt;Harden is straight trash and unreliable, theres a reason why KD curved him and rather play with a REAL superstar.  Harden has playoff woes, but he's still a superstar. He was voted MVP by the players the year that Steph got his first MVP, and he also had a good playoff run that year too. The only real knock on Harden is inefficiency and a handful of bad games, other than that he's a pretty good playoff performer with some chinks in his armor that need to be patched up, but like I've said, this isn't about Harden.  Oh and you know that Harden got traded to save money, right? KD didn't curve shit lmao. Maybe if you actually didn't some fucking research you'd know.   &gt;Kobe isnt better than curry  Kobe was a better scorer, better defender, had better intangibles, executed better in the clutch, and I'd even go as far to say more valuable to his teams during his last 4 rings than Curry was for his last two. Shaq would've won in 2000 no matter what, but the 3-peat isn't happening without Kobe.   I can do this all day lmao. "
"Here's my unpopular opinion: a hard cap won't solve superteams, but removing the max contract will.  A player like Stephen Curry is actually worth more than a supermax, because under the CBA, transcendent players like James and Curry are gonna be paid the same as second-tier and even third-tier stars because there's a limit on how much teams can pay them.  If Curry got his market value last year, then KD would have had to either seek another team that would pay him his market value or take an even bigger paycut to stay with GSW."
"They don’t like his dad + he’s a Laker point guard + highly drafted + he’s a large media presence + he’s not the scoring archetype PG that’s common in the NBA  Plus, people see him as easy prey because it’s early in his career and for some reason they don’t want his dad to be “right” that his son is good even though Lonzo is very talented and with his abilities has a good chance of being a legit PG. Might not be a Stephen Curry, but he can be a great point guard. "

Curry/LeBron/KD are all capable of exerting their will on a game more so than Harden/Kawhi/AD. Just look at the Warriors third quarter runs - that's Curry at 100 is basically the shimmy quarter. Dubs were +500 in the third last year.    [&gt; Curry was the NBA’s best third-quarter player this season. In the regular season, he averaged 10 points in third quarters, nearly two points more than any other player in the league, while shooting a gaudy 54 percent from the field and 51 percent from beyond the arc. In the postseason, he’s averaging nine points per third quarter and his percentages have gone up — 58 percent from the field and 57 percent from beyond the arc.] (https://www-mercurynews-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/03/nba-finals-2018-game-2-golden-state-warriors-vs-cleveland-cavaliers-cavs-lebron-james-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-schedule-news/amp/?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQECAE4AQ%3D%3D#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mercurynews.com%2F2018%2F06%2F03%2Fnba-finals-2018-game-2-golden-state-warriors-vs-cleveland-cavaliers-cavs-lebron-james-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-schedule-news%2F)"
"Seriously... There are people here who rate Oscar Robertson over Stephen Curry. A player who missed the playoffs 4 times and was a first round exit another 2 or 3 times in his prime in the 60s and couldn’t win anything until Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came along. He had less MVPs than Curry in an infinitely less competitive era. Oscar’s stats adjusted to pace and minutes aren’t nearly as good and he did it against weak competition. It’s insane to me how highly people rank players from the 60s and 70s, and even 80s sometimes."
"Stephen Curry's shot hasn't had quite as favorable variance the past couple of seasons, but he has become much more skilled at driving to the basket and finishing there since his unanimous MVP season and is a much better scorer.  I think people are taking Curry for granted. He had a 67.5 TS% last season, which is the best in NBA history for a 20 PPG scorer.   He's definitely better than Harden (he just outplayed him head to head in the Western finals for goodness sake), and also outplayed Anthony Davis in the series they had together, although they don't go head to head at all because of the positional differences, so there is less to glean off of that.  It's hard to tell what Durant does to Curry's game. It doesn't seem like Durant actually does much. He doesn't really create open looks for Curry or prevent Curry from getting doubled, and Curry had equally impressive efficiency seasons without Durant (66.9 TS% in the unanimous MVP season). I think if Durant wasn't there, you'd see Curry get around 3 more PPG, while maybe being 1-2 TS% less. "

That makes ""normal"" hard to find these days. An extraordinary basketball player who just wants to be an ordinary one doesn't fly with a public drunk on celebrities. Rossiter remembers a late-night dinner in New York when Curry and the Warriors were in town. Curry's two phones just kept dinging and dinging and dinging, one message after another.  &gt; ""I thought to myself, 'Hmm, maybe I shouldn't text him so much,'' Rossiter says.  &gt; But at Davidson, and with these people, he can go back to being a regular, to being a guy in search of a good prank."

"Yes, he’s elite.   &gt; The answer is that he creates better shots for his teammates. Assists are inherently meaningless. They’re a proxy for how much a player helps his team score, sure, but they’re a crude metric from an era when better ones didn’t exist. It’s cool that Westbrook flipped the odometer in three popular stats for the first time in a long time, but the person who touched the ball last before someone else made a shot is irrelevant. These days, we have much better data to help figure out whether a player makes his teammates better on offense. Curry does.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/   Being just a great scorer doesn’t create a great offense as we saw with KD running the Warriors without Curry. His playmaking creates easy looks for everyone which leads to historic figures with Curry even with the other all-stars off. He uses his gravity as a playmaking tool to create historically efficient offense.  There’s a reason every offensive metric grades him out as the best (or second best depending on the year) offensive player in the NBA."

"Stephen Curry.  Best PG ever, greatest gravity ever. 3 titles in 4 years, snubbed for finals mvp, always gets manhandled and ignored by refs because he does not flop.  And a great team player. Always sacrifices touches/points/assists for the good of the team and plays hard D even if he gets a bad matchup, was like a wall for Lebron in the finals.

"Stephen Curry is to long distance 3s what Babe Ruth was to home runs. Before Babe Ruth no one was really *trying* to hit home runs on the regular, it just kind of happened every once in a while. Then Babe Ruth came along, started hitting dingers, and everyone was like ""who the fuck is this guy, what's his deal?"" Eventually it started to become the norm because everybody wanted to be like the Great Bambino. Curry is the same way, he's completely changed the game. And just like Babe Ruth, more and more players are starting to emulate him because now they know it's possible. Take [Trae Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMvadVBsRjI) for example.

Mike D'Antoni arrived in Phoenix for the 04-05 season. The previous year they took ~1200 threes. Under D'Antoni they took 2,026, and won 62 games. They shot a similar number the next year and won 54 games.   They were the first team to take 2,000 three-pointers in a season, and since then it has been done 35 more times.   Steve Nash won two MVPs, and in many ways [he's the blueprint for Curry.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/steve-nash-on-stephen-curry-hes-taken-what-i-did-to-another-level/) Nash didn't take the same volume of 3s that Curry does, but he was more of a pass first player.

During that season John Stockton put up this ludicrous stat line:  17.2 ppg on .514 fg, .416 3pt, and .819 ft.  14.5 apg with 3.5 topg.  2.7 spg.  That is worlds better than both of Steve Nash's MVP seasons, and if Steve Nash had had his prime during the age of MJ, he wouldn't have won anything either.  John Stockton's career true shooting is .6081.  He is 6th all time in win shares (just barely behind Michael Jordan).  He is 1st all time in assists with 15,806, beating the second place Jason Kidd who has 12,091 (in an era where there were fewer assists and more iso ball).  He is 1st all time in steals with 3,265, beating second place Jason Kidd who has 2,684.  He has the NBA's all time iron man run.  He led the NBA in assists for 9 straight seasons, which is another ridiculous record that won't be touched.  &gt;  Stockton is the most overrated player on this sub, no one who watched him considered him a top tier player like Curry is.  Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon all considered him a top tier player.  You genuinely don't know what you're talking about.  I resent that your ignorance is causing me to argue against Stephen Curry, my current favorite player and someone I think could possibly go down in the top 10 all time if his game ages well."
You would draft Jason Kidd over Stephen Curry? 
Very few players can make an argument to have reached Currys 2016/16 offensive level. I have nothing to argue against that. It was a great season to watch unfold.   How would you not call curry a liability on the defensive end? [this explains pretty well how they picked on him ](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2492176-how-cleveland-cavaliers-are-exploiting-stephen-currys-defense-in-the-nba-finals). Like I said I've never seen a superstar get picked on the defensive end like I saw curry during those finals.
Stephen Curry is the all time leader in playoff TS% for 20 point scorers.

"What? This is such a stupid statement. Okay, Stephen Curry is a busy person. He can't sign autographs for everyone he meets on the street. He signs autographs for people who go to the camps because he is teaching those kids and has time. He didn't open the window because he was going somewhere and didn't want to be bothered. Celebrities and famous athletes need time to themselves. It's fun to be recognized, but when you are really famous, it can get annoying. Lastly, the reason why Curry went to Davidson because that was the only place he got an offer. His goal was to make the NBA. He couldn't get there without going to a college that plays at a higher level. This is such a stupid claim."

"I'd take Western Conference. The reason?  3 pointers.  PG: Chris Paul SG: Stephen Curry SF: Kevin Durant PF: Dirk Nowitzki C: Anthony Davis  Sub: Ray Allen, James Harden, Karl Malone, Yao Ming, Hakeen Olajuwon, Tim Duncan  These players could drive, and spread the perimeter. From 1-5 they all could shoot 3s. Durant and Davis have the athleticism, and the reach to rebound and also shoot (Davis got the 3pts down) while Nowitzki have the finesse to shoot. Paul and Curry could dribble their way and step back for the 3s as usual.   Subs would have the reigning 3pt made of all time in Jesus Shuttlesworth and 3pts step-back iso king of James Harden. Yao could also shoot back in the days (see his Olympics highlights) and Olajuwon, Malone and Duncan sub the center to play the low-post.   This is just my opinion, how do you guys think about it? Cause from my observation, 3pts have changed the way the game evolved drastically. Especially after the Warriors won their 1st title. 3pt dagger have been the most crucial moment in a lot of NBA games. "

Stephen Curry is the most disrespected player in the league. It sounds crazy but it's true. 
"This says he giannis was number 4 in jersey sales last year and kawhi was 11, also bucks were 6 for team merch and the spurs were not on the list. [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/article/2018/04/17/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-lead-most-popular-merchandise-list-2017-18) .  Obviously kawhi didn’t play last year and that would probably account for the big gap but I still believe giannis is a more marketable player."
"Stephen Curry is (arguably) the best player on a dynasty, and (not arguably) the most important piece of that dynasty. Those two facts alone make him easily better than Anthony Davis, without even diving into the accolades and statistics"
"Yes, Kobe Bryant is arguably the most overrated basketball player in history. He is often ranked among the Top-Ten players of all time, which I think this is absurd. The following are the reasons I consider Kobe overrated: Kobe is NOT an All-Time Great Scorer. One of the most prevalent arguments as to why Kobe is a all-time great, is his supposedly legendary scoring ability, which is often compared to all-time great, Michael Jordan. However, lets take a closer look at this claim and show why it is flawed: Kobe has only 2 Scoring Titles. Kobe has only lead the league in points per game 2 times, in 19-year career. In comparison: Michael Jordan has done so 10 times. Wilt Chaimberlain has done so 7 times. Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson have done so 4 times. (KD has been in the NBA, less than half the time Kobe had, and has twice the number of scoring titles) Kobe has a Career Points-Per-Game Average of 25. Kobe averaged 25 PPG, over his career. This is a fantastic average, however, it does not rank among the greatest career averages. Kobe’s PPG average does NOT rank among the Top 10. LeBron’s career average is 27.2 PPG, while Kobe’s career average in the same span was 24.8. However, Kobe is generally considered a greater scorer. Allen Iverson, who is generally not considered among the greatest NBA players ever, had a career average of 26.7 PPG, also greater than that of Kobe. Kobe has had the Worst Chokes in the NBA Finals. Kobe is often ranked among the most clutch players in NBA history. This is not backed by substance, and this is evidenced in some of his NBA Finals performances over the years. 2004 NBA Finals: Game 3 vs Detroit Pistons In Game 3 of the 2004 NBA Finals, against the Detroit Pistons, with the series tied at 1–1, Kobe had arguably the worst choke of any superstar in Finals history, which led to a loss by 20 points. Kobe finished the game with just 11 Points on a terrible 30% shooting, with 3 Rebounds, 5 Assists and 4 Turnovers. 2008 NBA Finals: Game 6 vs Boston Celtics Facing elimination, with his team down 3–2 in the series, with a chance to force a Game 7 in Staples Center, Kobe, the reigning MVP of the league, choked again in one of the biggest games of his career, which led to the Lakers losing the Championship. Kobe finished the game with 22 Points on a dismal 32% shooting, with just 3 Rebounds and a pathetic 1 Assist with 4 Turnovers. 2010 NBA Finals: Game 7 vs Boston Celtics With a brilliant chance at redemption, against a Boston Celtics team that defeated his Lakers two years ago, Kobe had a chance to cement his legacy as a clutch performer on the biggest stage of all: Game 7 of the NBA Finals, at home. Yet, he choked again. Kobe finished the game with 23 Points, of which he scored 11 from the free-throw line, thanks to receiving a ridiculous 15 free-throw attempts (ahem Referees? ahem). He scored 12 Points from the field on a awful 25% shooting, with just 1 Assist and 4 Turnovers, but did have a stellar 15 Rebounds. But thanks to the Referees (The Lakers got 20 more free-throws than the Celtics), the Lakers happened to win this game and Kobe won his 5th Ring. Compare these chokes with LeBron’s Finals: Game 4 performance against the Mavericks, which sparked conversation about LeBron being a Choke-Artist. LeBron put up a measly 8 Points on 27% shooting, but had 9 Rebounds and 7 Assists, therefore having about similar production as Kobe’s in the fore-mentioned games. Kobe has only ONE Regular Season MVP (Which he didn’t really deserve). Kobe Bryant has only one regular season MVP , which is put 12 players who have more MVPs than him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has done so 6 times. Michael Jordan has done so 5 times. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson have done so 3 times. Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry have done so 2 times. Kobe Bryant did win the 2007–2008 season, but did not deserve it. Let us take a look at Kobe’s stats, compared to other players’ performances. Kobe Bryant: 28.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG, 46% FG, 36% 3P, with a record 57–25. Chris Paul: 21.1 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 11.6 APG, 2.7 SPG, 0.1 BPG, 49% FG, 37%3P, with a record 56–26. LeBron James: 30.0 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG, 48% FG, 32% 3P, with the record 45–37. Amar’e Stoudemire: 25.2 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.1 BPG, 59% FG, 16% 3P, with the record 55–27. Kobe is an Extremely Inefficient player. Kobe Bryant has an Career Field Goal Percentage of 44.7%. Kobe Bryant, despite being a versatile scorer, has thelowest field goal percentageamong the Top 15 All-Time Career Scorers. Kobe Bryant has scored a total 33,643 Points, off 26,200 Shots. In Comparison, Karl Malone has scored a total of 36,928 Points, off 26,210 Shots. Which means, Karl Malone has taken 10 more shots than Kobe Bryant, but has scored 3,285 more points. Kobe has the Most Career Field Goals Missed. Kobe has missed 14,481 Shots in his career, which happens to be 1,064 more than the next player, John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant hold the record with the Most Missed Shotsin a single game with 30 while shooting just 36% against the Boston Celtics in 2002. In the Top 100 for most field goals missed in a game, Kobe hold 25 of those spots, making for a quarter of the total. Kobe Bryant is NOT a clutch player. Kobe does have some great moments in the clutch, but individual moments do not mean he is a great clutch performer. Kobe Bryant missed the last 15 straight game-tying/go-ahead FG in final 5 seconds of 4th quarter/OT of his career, and his last game-winner was in March 2012. Kobe Bryant has a Field-Goal Percentage of 29.1%, over his career, on game-tying or go ahead shots in the last 24 seconds of a game, over his career, only making 48 out of 164 attempts Kobe Bryant has received multiple Undeserved All-Star Selections. Kobe Bryant has been selected to the All-Star Game in the years 2014 and 2016, for which he was undeserving. He received these on the basis of legacy, rather than on performance. His stats for these seasons were: In 2014, Kobe Bryant played a total of 6 games, where he averaged just 13.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG and 6.3 APG. In 2016, Kobe averaged 17.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 2.8 APG. Kobe has been gifted Multiple Championships by Referees. Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, whether knowingly or unknowingly, have been subject to some of the most blatantly rigged NBA Playoff games, in history. 2002 Western Conference Finals In Game 6, of a tight western conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, where the reigning champion Lakers were facing elimination, the Lakers received a ridiculous27 Free-Throws, in the fourth quarter, compared to the Kings’ 9. Watch the video below to see for yourself: 2010 NBA Finals In Game 7 of the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics, Kobe shot a disgusting 6 of 24 from the field. However, thanks to the 15 Free-Throwshanded to him by the referees, compared to the whole Boston Celtics team got 17 Free-Throws, Kobe won his 5th Ring. Watch the following video to see yourself: Now I am not saying Kobe is not a legend, I am simply saying that he is given much more credit than some of his more deserving contemporaries. He deserves to be compared to players like John Stocktonand Reggie Miller who are fantastic players, but NOT All-Time Greats like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Tough question because most basketball experts do not overrate him. Most place him somewhere in the top 10–15. That’s about right. But most young basketball fans do overrate him. Many put him in the top 5. Those that do usually do not have strong knowledge of basketball history; usually overrate individual play; and usually overrate athleticism. Players that are definitely ahead of Kobe: Jordan, Magic Johnson, Jabbar, Russell, Chamberlain, Lebron James In my view, none of these are worth debating versus Kobe. Players that are probably ahead of Kobe: Duncan, O’Neal, Bird, Olajuwon, Robertson Players that are close and/or may finish their careers as close: West, Durant, Curry, Moses Malone So, in my view, Kobe is 12th at highest. Or somewhere in the 10–14 range. That’s still great. So what I say next does not diminish him but only puts him in context versus the other great players. Kobe Bryant is definitely the most selfish and least likable teammate of anyone on the list. (Chamberlain is close on the selfish front. Robertson is close on the least likable front). When I engage in these discussions with my fellow GMs, we set up the ground rule as who would I want on my team for 5 years. This is an important distinction because character/personality become increasingly important over time. Indeed, Kobe would likely be in the top ten if this was a single game or single series. Shaq is another guy that loses ground in this area. At his peak, he was crazy dominant but his laziness and selfishness are draining after a period of time. As a contrast, Duncan and Magic are rated higher than their athleticism might indicate because they are the ultimate team guys. But Kobe’s character deflates his teammates, unlike the majority of those ahead of him who elevate their teammates. Over time, team chemistry decreases. And, of course, losses or implosion occur. Is Kobe overrated by young NBA fans, yes. "
Do you think Stephen Curry is gonna end up retiring as a top 10 player ever. Same question with KD 
"**Speaking about the West,**  Lebron is locked in for a spot  Boogie is clearly out  **Questionable/Competitive for spots:**  Draymond green  Paul George  Lamarcus Aldridge  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Karl-Anthony Towns  **Some new guys who may make the cut:**  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Nikola Jokic  DeMar DeToronto  **Fairly safe list:**  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Lebron James  Klay Thompson  **Definitely not going to make the cut:**  Melo  A lot of these spots depend on team standing as well as individual numbers. The MVP players(James, Curry, Durant, Westbrook, Harden) can coast in based on reputation even if they are having a rough season."

"Lacob deserves huge credit. The Warriors were a failed organization. [Chris Cohan bought the team in '95 and proceeded to run it into the ground.](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2010/3/23/1387430/16-years-of-chris-cohan-owning-the)   Cohan was so bad that when Lacob bought the team he said ""We're not the cure for cancer, but we might be the cure for Cohan."" It created a small kerfuffle and kind of presaged ""light years.""   Lacob didn't hesitate to make moves necessary to get the team competitive, like trading away the popular Stephen Jackson and Monta Ellis for Andrew Bogut. He hired good staff, people like Jerry West, keeping Riley around, Bob Myers, and worked to instill a good culture.   Myers stepped into the GM role only 12 months after joining the organization. We know the draft picks he hit on because we all watch them play. He was involved in engineering the plan to build the team into the super juggernaut that it is today. You can go all the way back to Curry's value contract, the $44m 4 year deal, signed under Myers. Ty Lawson had just signed a $48m deal and when Curry was asked about being underpaid he said this,  &gt;""I could potentially be underpaid. I just don't want to be that guy who is overpaid. That's my mission.""  They did a great job building a championship level roster and the final move was hiring Steve Kerr. Steve Kerr came in and with essentially the same roster as previous head coach Mark Jackson took the team from 51-31 and a 1st round exit to a 67 win season and a championship. He's also instilled a culture of player empowerment player buy-in.   I've worked at enough different organizations to know that leadership is super important. I believe most enterprises, public or private, large or small, fail or succeed based on the quality of their leadership.   That's why I don't give short shrift to a guy like Lacob. Because I **guarantee** you that under the Cohan timeline it's Stephen Curry who's traded away instead of Monta Ellis and they'd whiff their draft picks and continue to be the worst team in the NBA. Being a leader is finding the right people and putting them in the right positions to enable them to succeed. That's what Lacob has done since he took over the team, and the results speak for themselves.   P.S. Without Curry the Warriors being far and away favorites definitely wouldn't have happened, so I do agree with you to a degree about it all being attributed to Curry, but under Lacob's leadership the team still would have gotten better and been a playoff team, simply based on the other moves they made."

"The eye test for fans is overrated because we aren’t as good at analyzing the game as we think we are. I think advanced analytics are the most reliable way to judge players, though they have outliers, it starts to become decently accurate when you incorporate multiple factors... The eye test shouldn’t be completely ignored but it’s not as important as many people claim it is in my opinion cause a lot of people like to act like their eye test is more reliable than every other factor when it clearly isn’t... The eye test may be better to see potential but not straight up production.   Edit: FWIW I made a stat combining multiple advanced stats together that had the most accurate looking league leaderboards and I think it came out pretty decently:  1. James Harden 11.12  2. Stephen Curry 9.69  3. LeBron James 9.61  4. Anthony Davis 9.11  5. Damian Lillard 8.68  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 8.15  7. Jimmy Butler 7.99  8. Chris Paul 7.73  9. Karl-Anthony Towns 7.53  10. Kevin Durant 7.02  11. Nikola Jokić 6.93  12. Kyrie Irving 6.75  13. Russell Westbrook 6.47  14. LaMarcus Aldridge 6.41  15. Victor Oladipo 5.65  16. Kyle Lowry 5.14  17. Clint Capela 4.96  18. Kemba Walker 4.87  19. Kevin Love 4.73  20. Rudy Gobert 4.68  It’s definitely not perfect but I think it has a better leaderboard than any singular advanced stat does... I’m not sure what I could do to improve it but it seems to favor low usage centers too much and hurts centers with high turnover rates and not-elite efficiency."

"This would be my pick too. Dirk at 4. Deandre at 5 to cover Dirk on D. Luka's already a fav for RoTY since he's had experience playing against grown men on a pro level unlike most other rookies. Discount KD/Stephen in Barnes/Curry. Still coached by Rick Carlisle who's one of the best coaches in the NBA.  I'm thinking they are actually good enough to make playoffs at a decent spot but people underestimating them because they were bad last year, Dirk's old, and West is stacked and a big 3 won't guarantee you anything. But they don't realize that Dirk isn't Melo and is willing to play off bench while still hitting shots, Mavs are a new young squad now, Seth was hurt last year, they picked up DJ/Luka, and Carl is still one of the best coaches who can make the new team gel. No one thinking Mavs make the playoffs, but I think they might even get a middle range seed.  While he isn't my 2018 sleeper player. I feel everyone is underrating Koustas (even Mavs fans who are star struck by Luka) who's flying under the radar since he didn't do well in college and got drafted last at 2nd/60th. I think Mavs should place resources into his development. If the kid ends up being 80% of Giannis the Mavs will have a shot at the title for years in the future."

"First of all when I was looking at assists I was looking at the wrong season I guess.   And let's just not talk about eFG% when we are talking about a Pre-Stephen Curry player and a Post-Stephen Curry player. Harden takes 10 3-Point Shots Per Game while Iverson only took 3 shots, also Harden plays for D'Antoni's team in which you either are a great 3 point shooter or aren't going get any playtime at all.   No, Harden is not the better playmaker. Iverson is one of the best ball handlers of all time and as I just stated in the last comment Harden only averages 1 assist more than AI.

"But as Lewenberg points out, all the reasons are business-related, we know that the league doesn't necessarily care much about showing ""good basketball"" on these nights. It's about the number of people who watch, and given the limited choices both in the number of sporting events available and the number of games the NBA has, these games are almost no-brainers.  I get why people are upset that the Bucks got a game, but they do have a young star in Giannis, who ranked [4th in jersey sales last season](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/04/17/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-lead-most-popular-merchandise-list-2017-18) and also carried his team to 6th in merchandise sales.

"Driving and finishing - Harden by a long shot.

Curry has a ton of gravity behind the 3-point line but Harden draws similar attention when he goes to the rim. Also, Curry plays with better shooters and has to deal with less help defense as a result.    If anyone doesn't want to do the math Harden: 17.1 Drives per game, resulting in 15.9 points for .93 PPD.

"Purely based on on-court impact? Off the top of my head I'd say that: MJ, LBJ, Kareem, Wilt, Hakeem, Shaq, Bill Russell, Magic, Kobe, and Duncan all had greater on-court impact on games than Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant."
"Reading is fundamental. The OP's title LITERALLY says ""BEST Mid-range shooter last season: Stephen Curry (60.0%).""  YOU are arguing vs. yourself. Are you a straw man? "

Stephen Curry once made two 3-pointers in a row for charity.
"It's fairly obvious, Stephen Curry got injured. They were on a much better winning pace before he went out, within 1 of 2 games of the Rockets if not ahead I believe. There were also some step-backs from Iguadola and Livingston last year."
TIL scoring points quickly is a result of teammates when it comes to Stephen Curry.  The best part is only 6/21 of Currys have come with KD on the team.  Remove the games with KD and Curry is tied for first still.  
"It’s a joke, right? Stephen Curry is only reason the Warriors became good, reason that KD joined them  Curry is a 2 x MVPs"
"I’m not saying it’s impossible for a 3-4 year player to become a superstar, I’m just saying it’s a lot less of an existence thereof because the more talented players usually prefer staying in college no longer than 2 years. Back then, there was a lot more players opting in to staying 3-4 years, therefore, there were a lot more talented players coming out after 3-4 years. Nowadays, those talented players don’t really desire to develop their fundamentals father in college and want to make that jump early as possible. A lot of people back in 1994-1995 believed that Tim Duncan should have foregone and went ahead and joined the NBA because he was that talented, but the mindset was different, Timmy wanted to get all 4 years in. Same for Nash.  Stephen Curry wasn’t necessarily an anomaly since there were still a lot of players staying in college back in 2008 and 2009, but again, he had his magic shooting talent back in college but desired to stay 3 years to get bigger and more NBA ready so he could use that ability in the league.  It’s just that in this league nowadays, the more talented players typically don’t want to stay in college because of academics/possibility of declining or injury so they jump to the NBA. There are still really talented players that go 3-4 years in college, just not as often as it used to be. "
"Golden State Warriors’ general manager Bob Myers proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Stephen Curry and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured center Boogie Cousins yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Shaun Livingston gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Klay Thompson yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Durant hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” Draymond said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”"

"I agree, but on those rare occasions when Steph goes 1/10 from three and the team needs points, I see nothing wrong with the greatest shooter in the world taking 2 pointers. Steph Curry would've won finals MVP if some of those 3 point shot in game 3 were made two pointers.  And I agree with the contact. It's a testament to Curry's toughness. If you haven't already, go on YouTube and search ""Stephen Curry Does Not Get Foul Calls"". As much flak as Curry gets for being soft, he's pretty tough  I used to think people were just Curry sexuals when they complained about all the contact until I actually watched Curry off the ball, or just when people crash into him while he's shooting. Very strange that the refs don't call as many fouls for Curry as sayyy, James Harden?"
"Read my other comments for Bird and Russell. Magic is just as great as Bird in my opinion. Magic is the only person to win a high school championship, a college championship, and a NBA championship within 4 years of each other. Magic also led his team to the finals with 3 different coaches. 5x champion. Magic Johnson and Stephen Curry are the only superstars that other superstars wanted to play with. Also, Magic is the greatest PG of all time. Being the best player on a top 3 best team of all time (Showtime Lakers) also is a factor  Edit: Not to mention his basketball IQ, toughness, and leadership. I hate it when people just frivolously throw around ""2nd only to Jordan"". Bullshit. Your resume has to compete with all time greats. I don't think it's an insult to call LeBron James number six greatest basketball player of all time. But you can't be number one with a 3-6 record in the finals."
"The ""best player in the league title"" is fluid and constantly switches from Steph Curry, LeBron James and Kevin Durant. If I had to rank them it would be   1. LeBron James  1a. Kevin Durant  1b. Steph Curry  Steph Curry does things that make him the best player in the game no matter who's on the floor. His weakness is his physicality and the unusual amount of fouls that aren't called for him. Steph Curry is the most cerebral of the three, but he can be made uncomfortable by teams with physical defense. Also, Steph Curry needs to add the mid range to his game, for those nights he goes 0/10 from three. If he's cold, he needs to see that ball go in but refuses to take 2 pointers. It's frustrating  Kevin Durant is a transcendant scoring talent who sees the game on a higher level ever since he joined the Warriors. His weakness is that he's not as mentally strong as LeBron or Steph and is prone to breakdowns (Steph is the leader of the Warriors, even though KD is the most talented). I don't knock him for not being an alpha like Stephen A. Smith. Some people aren't born to lead, and that's okay  LeBron James brings more to the game than anybody else. LeBron has a lot of weaknesses, the first being his mental strength (which he has improved on the last few years) and the second is LeBron James isn't willing to play off the ball. This is why high IQ teams beat him in the finals (Mavericks, Spurs, Warriors). LeBron also isn't a good leader, but better than KD  &amp;#x200B;  Every time I get close to saying these things about any of these players I get murdered by there respective fan bases. It gets exhausting but its what I believe"

Steph, looking at all the statistics as yall love to look at, locked up bron on each one of his possessions when he was put to guard him  steph is BETTER than KD in every single advanced offensive metric.   GSW system is STEPH’S SYSTEM.   steph does NOT only shoot 3s, he’s 1b to Kyrie’s 1a as best finisher around the rim  if westbrook is considered better than Klay, why couldnt him and durant do it when steph and Klay could?   NO ONE has gravity like steph has gravity. stop fooling yourselves  KD was not better than steph before he hopped on the team, and all of a sudden he’s better than steph now? cmon yall really out here tryna disrespect the lil dude.

Don’t really hate any teams but for currently relevant teams our fans might not like:  Los Angeles: LeBron James (arguably most entertaining player to watch)  Philadelphia: Dario Sarić (underrated)  Toronto: Kyle Lowry (underrated)  Washington: Otto Porter (underrated)  Golden State: Stephen Curry (amazing to watch + also lowkey underrated now)
"Dunn isn't starting for any team besides tanking teams .... also Lavine was paid 20 mil with a torn ACL and averaged 16 points on 38%FG and 34% from 3 (Worse than Butler) in 24 games. Also the pick number 7 while valuable there was no telling who the wolves would've picked. If every lottery pick turned out well, the wolves or any tanking team wouldn't be in this situation. The last All star to be picked no.7 was stephen curry in 2009 who the wolves passed on twice. This is all hindsight and it was not a terrible trade when it happened "
"&gt;last season his usage was 21.7 which was 118th in the league   His usage was 29.6 according the basketball reference and NBA.com.  according to the same sites, Wiggins had a 23.2 and 23.4.  So Lavine is just a couple percentage points off of LeBron James in usage, in other words.   &gt;Good efficiency means better than average TS%, I thought that was fairly straightforward.  It is straightforward, thanks for that.  What doesn't seem to be straightforward; however, is what our definition of ""average"" is, considering Lavine was sub 50% from TS, again according to NBA.com and BR.  That leaves him at 408 out of 519 qualifying players for the metric.  So he's using the ball at almost the same rate as Stephen Curry, and shooting it with comparable efficiency to Dwayne Buycks.    &gt;Also there’s a bad rep with having high usage, if you’re efficient there’s nothing wrong with it   I agree. He's not tho.  &gt;Wiggins and KAT both had significantly higher usage than him last season, and Shabazz’ was about even with LaVine’s  No they didn't.  I already spelled out how much higher his usage was than Wiggins, but towns was at 22.9.  coincidentally shooting 64.6 TS.    &gt;he’s not a ball stopper either, he puts up about 3 apg and his AST% was about even with Donovan Mitchell, Manu Gimobili, Kelly Olympic, Lance Stephenson, Will Barton. None is these guys are known as ball stoppers.  So, A.) this happened in a per 100 context of 26 shots, 5 assists and 3 turnovers, meaning every 100 times he ended a possession, he only got an assist 14-15% of the time, which is 4-5% more than the much maligned, and third choice, Andrew Wiggins.  Lavine was playing his way to form/fitness last year during an end of season littered with tanking teams, and at a point where the bulls only real aim was losing and getting Lavine into form, ergo the 29% usage rate.  So, you know yer right--thats right around Donovan Mitchell, but that wasn't a particularly good stat for Donovan Mitchell, and in fact is likely one of the things Mitchell should be working on.  Donovan Mitchell was a high usage player, and he needs to work on his efficiency.  That's not any different than what I'm saying for Lavine.  Actually there is a difference: I believe in Donovan Mitchell's ability to adjust here and become a hyper efficient, high usage player.    I'm not sure I believe Lavine's ability to do so, especially with a $78m incentive to prove to everyone he's too dog.   &gt;So idk if you have preconceived notions with LaVine or what, but most of your opinions on him seem to be incorrect and unfounded.   I do, and they're based on his freaking performances!  Can he get better? Sure? Is he a $78m player?  I'll take Josh Richardson for 40m instead, please.  But i appreciate the convo so you get an up it's."

"Well they sure fooled me. Never been west of the Mississippi. Im a warriors fan because i watched curry at davidson and loved his march madness run, but i took everyone around me’s word for it and assumed it was just a feelgood college story that wouldn’t translate to the nba (i hadnt actually paid attention to the nba since shaq and penny).  Years later after grad school and being too busy to care about sports at all, i saw [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/16/upshot/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-3-pointers.html) and nearly spit out my coffee. Watched some games and was instantly hooked on gsw’s motion offense and eventually on the league in general (just in time to experience a finals loss...)   If youre a bay area native, why are you a lakers fan? Similar story?"
This is an astonishingly bad take.  There is not a single team in the league that would be better off with 33 year old Chris Paul than Stephen Curry.  The more interesting question is whether any team in the league would be better off with peak Chris Paul than Stephen Curry today but the answer is still probably no.
KD is better than Stephen Curry.  
"In the upper left quadrant of the image, each of the circles is an individual teammate for a given season.  The dark blue one, for example, is Dante Cunningham, whose shot quality improved by 6.1% with AD on the floor in 2017-18.  So the model is clearly based on how stars affect *individual* teammates' shot quality to start with, which means it's not just based on which unit is on the floor.  What's not clear is how those individual figures are aggregated to get the total impact on teammate shot quality.  You can play around with it [here](https://fansided.com/2018/09/11/nylon-calculus-pbpstats/).  ETA: Based on [this article](https://fansided.com/2018/03/26/nylon-calculus-evolution-stephen-curry-pure-point-guard/), it's clear that Nylon Calculus aggregates these statistics by taking the weighted mean of teammate TS% change, where the weight is the harmonic mean of minutes the teammate plays with and without the player.  This emphasizes teammates who play both with and without the player, as opposed to teammates who mostly play with the player or without him.  This could lead to issues for teams that mostly follow a first-unit, second-unit rotation philosophy, but at first glance it seems like a solid aggregation method."

"Not really. He's been an amazing player for a while, just didn't get his due, and his team and coaching staff were not up to par. He was small and skinny, and similar to Conley, didn't put up a lot of shots, so casuals weren't in love with him. Sadly for Conley he's stuck in a super small market playing 80s basketball while he's one of the best point guards of the decade. At least Curry got a modern coach and good teammates at some point.

He was seen as a ""shooter"" early on, while he was already an MVP level player under Mark Jackson. His boxscore stats have never been *extremely* impressive a la Russ, but they were still very good. Curry casually averages almost 7 assists for his career, while playing alongside David Lee, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jarret Jack, etc, and under Mark Jackson. The Warriors were 12th in ORtg in 2013, which says enough of Jacksons coaching.  Curry is the ultimate plug and play guard. He fits **every team**, and contrary to popular belief, he's an average defender, and sometimes even a good one. He doesn't have Durants height, but he's smart, quick in the passing lanes, stays in front of his man and stays focused.  ------------  If Player Impact Plus Minus doesn't work for you, Curry has been at the top of RPM since it was created. 6th in 2013, and 1st in 2014, top 4 **at least** since then.   He just never got the credit he deserved until he averaged 30ppg, since there's people that still believe Harden should have won MVP in 2015 (lol)  Something similar happens to Draymond, where his alltime great defensive presence is undermined.  Meanwhile KD for some reason is though of as a good defender, and people think Klay is prime Sidney Moncrief, while he's very average on the defensive end.  "

"This is something that absolutely has to be taken into consideration with Gobert. We ultimately decided that he's an incredibly effective player against probably 27 of the other teams in the league, and that was enough for us. The Warriors and Rockets aren't the only litmus test. There's an entire regular season to consider, most of which will be waged against teams that don't have Stephen Curry or James Harden or Chris Paul. Then there are all the other possible playoff matchups, in which Gobert could play a dominant role. Just look what he did to the Thunder – OKC couldn't even manage 99 points per 100 possesssions when Gobert was on the floor in the first round. It definitely works against Gobert that two of the best teams in the league would be tough matchups for him, specifically, but we also take into account the fact that Gobert, just by being on the floor, requires opponents to step out of their normal rhythm to account for him, specifically. There's power in that.  Also: I'd dispute the notion that Gobert was exploited by Capela. Really, he was exploited by Paul. -- RM"

"&gt; Are there players that you suggest I keep my eye on? Up-and-comers?   **best dudes in the league/most fun to watch:** pretty much anyone who's been on the all nba / all star team. Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook are considered the best (in no order).  ""**Up-and-comers"":** Ben Simmons, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Jokic, Karl Anthony Towns, Devin Booker.

Stephen Curry is the most insane mix of talent and privilege I've ever seen. 
"&gt; I wouldn’t say Wade is certainly a better playoff performer.  Honestly I think they are pretty close.  Dwyane Wade Playoffs 05-12: 26.2 PPG, 5.8 RPG, 5.3 APG, 1.7 SPG, 1.2 BPG, 3.7 TOPG on 48/32/78 shooting (57 TS%)  Stephen Curry Playoffs 13-18: 26.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 6.4 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.3 BPG, 3.6 TOPG on 45/41/89 shooting (61 TS%)  The stats are about the same and Curry is a bit more efficient, but Wade of course played better defense as well."
"Not really that big of a risk IMO. Trading away Monta Ellis by itself was addition by subtraction: it got rid of an empty points scorer who was bad on defense and needed the ball in his hands to be effective (opening up more usage for Stephen Curry), and it opened up more playing time and a starting spot for Klay Thompson."
"We are primarily discussing prime Kobe. Even though Kobe retired in 2016 he was a shell of his former self, afflicted by the countless injuries he endured in his 20 year career. The last time he was considered elite was in 2013, which was 5 years ago. Also, the NBA landscape of the having heavy motion offense with floor spacers wasn't truly realized until the Spurs showcased it winning in 2014, and the Warriors perfecting it from 2015 onward, and other the past few years of other teams trying to emulate this formula of success.  To further elaborate, 3 point attempts have increased, which in turn, means more opportunities to score more points. In 2013, where I'd argue Kobe was last considered elite, the league average was 20 three point attempts per game. As each year passed the attempts have gone up to where we are now in 2018, it is now 29 three point attempts per game. That is a potential of 27 more points in a span of 5 years. If you go even further back to where Kobe scored 81 points in 2006, three point attempts were only at an average of 16.   Stephen Curry today shoots 10 3 pointers by himself. Kobe Bryant has a career average of 4 three point attempts. If Kobe upped his three point volume to match the current era, Kobe would have more points. Kobe would play in today's era of having more floor spacers, having the freedom to shoot more threes, and playing at a faster pace, As a result Kobe would have better per game numbers than he currently shows for his career averages. Obviously this applies to all past players but I just wanted to specifically look at Kobe."
Stephen Curry hit more threes in a two year period than Larry Bird did in his entire 12 year career.
I can honestly say I have never treated Stephen Curry like God.

"I can’t wait to see a 7”1 Fernando Oduwano with Giannis like build, a 47 inch vertical, and a jump shot that resembles Stephen Curry comes into the league. I see the 76ers drafting him in about 16 years after our current core ends and we rehire Sam Hinkie for The Process: Part 2. After some youngn years we will win the 2038-2041 NBA Titles where he will then leave us to join the Lakers. The city of LA, who have been waiting to return to prominence since LeBron, Kawhi, and Ingram had last won those shocking titles in 2020 and 2021 where they overcame two separate 3-1 deficits to the Warriors to sweep the Celtics the first year and then beat the 76ers in 6 the next. He will then proceed to choke in his first year in the Finals with LA before winning won the next year. Unfortunately, Oduwano suffers a career ending injury in game 4 of the Finals when they were going for the sweep (they managed to pull it out in 6). He retires with a career average 37/9/7 on 55/43/88 shooting and although his shortened career will be the undeniable GOAT to those who have watched. "
"Skillset is a combination of genetics and muscle memory. In sports like basketball, it's more about muscle memory. That's why your idea of more advanced training doesn't make sense, because it doesn't work that way. No high school players goes to a Stephen Curry camp and turns out to be a different player with different training regimen, or gains the edge he needed to make it as pro. It's not that impactful.   The whole rationalization chain is missing in your claims, argumentatively, just doesn't add up because of that at all. Saying something is something is such a poor way of arguing for a point, you don't explain why at all and the burden of rationalization lies with the owner of the claim.   Referencing a book might fill that void, but I don't care enough about this topic to read a book about it to be frank. It's not like the topic is history of Eastern geopolitics where I'd look at a referenced book."

"You sound like us Lakers fans on NBA message boards in the mid-2000’s. Everyone acted like Kobe wasn’t an all-time great back then.  It’s funny when you think about how many people act like they’d hate to have volume shooting superstars on their team, but I guarantee they wouldn’t be saying that dumb shit if the players were already on their team from the get-go.  Who in their right mind wouldn’t want Westbrook? Maybe if your starting PG is Stephen Curry, sure, but I refuse to believe the other 29 teams’ fan bases would hate having Westbrook on their roster."

I wish I was friend with Stephen curry 
Yeah it totally wasn’t because [Curry played like crap](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-finals-mvp-worst-ever-062016?amp=true) in the finals or anything.  Or because [Draymond Green was the only starter who didn’t play like complete trash](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html).
"No top 15 player in the NBA should be facing single coverage, KD got a lot of that because of Curry facing the double teams.     I'm old school, been watching the game since early 80s, to me the move to GSW is soft, I rarely agree with the man nowadays, but Stephen A was 100% right that morning when KD signed there.    In saying that, I respect your opinion, but agree to disagree.     With all that money and spotlight, you have to accept being a role model. We do put them on a pedestal, not accepting the fact that they are humans, and no human is perfect..... This has to be remembered....     The game has been watered down though, it's fast paced and exciting no doubt, but the rules of the real game have been disrespected and put on the back burner for the rights to profits."
It's easy though. I have:  1. Artis Gilmore   2. DeAndre Jordan   3. Cedric Maxwell   4. Tyson Chandler   5. Stephen Curry   6. James Donaldson   7. Adrian Dantley   8. Reggie Miller   9. Charles Barkley   10. Kevin Durant
"So where do you put him between: Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony (he's ass but he's at least able to coast on popularity), Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, and Joel Embiid?"

"&gt; Poseidon was God of the sea and natural disasters like storms and earthquakes. He was extremely powerful and had a temper. Noone wanted to see his bad side as he'd become very hard to calm down once angered and wasn't the compromising type. As such, I'll say he is Kobe Bryant.  That sounds more like Boogie than Kobe, Kobe doesn't have a temper issue. He's more passive aggressive and blunt than anything.  &gt; Apollo was the God of the sun, light, knowledge, science, philosophy, arts, health and disease. Apollo was also considered an extremely important god next to Athena. His personality was very complex and his behaviour unpredictable. He often provided all kinds blessings and gave all kinds of curses. I think Kahwi Leonard is NBA's Apollo. Can be a game changer but can also make everything crumble. Noone knows exactly what he is thinking.  I think Kyrie fits better here  &gt; Aphrodite was the Goddess of love, sexuality, lust, allure and persuasion. Every human that laid eyes on her would see her in the form of the ideal woman of his fantsasies. Anyone she touched (including Gods) would fall in love with her. She oversees all forms of sexual relationships from pure innocent love to prostitution. She was quite mischievous. Aphrodite is thus Stephen Curry cause he is the ideal fit to any team and attracts superstars like a magnet.  Screams Kelly Oubre Jr"
"People mistake changes in the rules for improvements in skill. People have noted that Stephen Curry has a very similar skill set to Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, but that the more grind it out midrange game of the late 80s early 90s made him a talent without a game.  It’s also one of the reasons Iverson was so incredible (and paved the way for the current small guy league today). He was so amazingly athletic and pugnacious that he could play at an MVP level against the Dale Davises, Anthony Masons and Charles Oakley’s of the world.  Iverson would absolutely excel in today’s league and it’s a terrible shame that his personal demons didn’t let him get there."

Why is Curry at 62.4% for 2015 with a 17.9 game score when LeBron had a 24.6. Curry has two teammates much closer to his game score(Iggy 13.6, Draymond 12.9) than he was to LeBron's. If it's simply due to winning the series, then LeBron should get very little percentage in 2017 and 2018 as well. And Durant's game score margin over Curry in both years was greater than Curry's over Iggy and Draymond in 2015.     KD posted the 2nd highest game score in NBA finals history in 2017 and the 10th highest of all time in 2018.

Meanwhile in 2017 KD was at 30.3, Curry was his closest teammate at 24.1(-6.2%) and then you have to go all the way down to Klay at 10.6(-19.7%). LeBron finished at 29.6(-0.7%) and Kyrie was the only other player above 15 at 18.2(-12.1%).    So how the hell is Thomas at 83.4% while Durant is at 43.1%. Even if it's proportional, Dumars and Laimbeer combined for +33.8% over Thomas proportionally and Drexler had the highest GSC of the Finals while losing the series. Meanwhile Klay and Curry combined for only 14.2% above KD and KD had the 2nd best game score in NBA Finals history   "
"&gt; Don't know where anyone gets the idea that r/nba loves LeBron.  6/25 posts on this sub are positive posts about LeBron/LeBron highlights. More than any other individual player. Is that really ""rightfully recognized?"" Seems a bit overboard. That's where some may get the idea that this sub loves LeBron.   People are saying that he does sometimes alienate teammates to a strict spot-up shooting role on the wing because sometimes he literally does. He is still great, but that has become a bigger flaw later in his career here, denying that is just being ignorant. Stephen Curry fouled out of an NBA finals game because LeBron flopped. He was at his worst in Miami but he is still pretty bad with the theatrics.   I do appreciate his game. He's been incredible to watch his entire career. I think his hate, while still there, is overwhelmed by this massive crowd of fans willing to defend LeBron for anything and everything. "
Stephen Curry is what would happen if Steve Nash cared about scoring over passing
"Copying this from another user. Kobe is the second most popular player ever. Kobe is not a top 10 player. Durant and Kobe probably end up close on all time lists.   &gt; Yes, Kobe Bryant is arguably the most overrated basketball player in history. He is often ranked among the Top-Ten players of all time, which I think this is absurd. The following are the reasons I consider Kobe overrated: Kobe is NOT an All-Time Great Scorer. One of the most prevalent arguments as to why Kobe is a all-time great, is his supposedly legendary scoring ability, which is often compared to all-time great, Michael Jordan. However, lets take a closer look at this claim and show why it is flawed: Kobe has only 2 Scoring Titles. Kobe has only lead the league in points per game 2 times, in 19-year career. In comparison: Michael Jordan has done so 10 times. Wilt Chaimberlain has done so 7 times. Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson have done so 4 times. (KD has been in the NBA, less than half the time Kobe had, and has twice the number of scoring titles) Kobe has a Career Points-Per-Game Average of 25. Kobe averaged 25 PPG, over his career. This is a fantastic average, however, it does not rank among the greatest career averages. Kobe’s PPG average does NOT rank among the Top 10. LeBron’s career average is 27.2 PPG, while Kobe’s career average in the same span was 24.8. However, Kobe is generally considered a greater scorer. Allen Iverson, who is generally not considered among the greatest NBA players ever, had a career average of 26.7 PPG, also greater than that of Kobe. Kobe has had the Worst Chokes in the NBA Finals. Kobe is often ranked among the most clutch players in NBA history. This is not backed by substance, and this is evidenced in some of his NBA Finals performances over the years. 2004 NBA Finals: Game 3 vs Detroit Pistons In Game 3 of the 2004 NBA Finals, against the Detroit Pistons, with the series tied at 1–1, Kobe had arguably the worst choke of any superstar in Finals history, which led to a loss by 20 points. Kobe finished the game with just 11 Points on a terrible 30% shooting, with 3 Rebounds, 5 Assists and 4 Turnovers. 2008 NBA Finals: Game 6 vs Boston Celtics Facing elimination, with his team down 3–2 in the series, with a chance to force a Game 7 in Staples Center, Kobe, the reigning MVP of the league, choked again in one of the biggest games of his career, which led to the Lakers losing the Championship. Kobe finished the game with 22 Points on a dismal 32% shooting, with just 3 Rebounds and a pathetic 1 Assist with 4 Turnovers. 2010 NBA Finals: Game 7 vs Boston Celtics With a brilliant chance at redemption, against a Boston Celtics team that defeated his Lakers two years ago, Kobe had a chance to cement his legacy as a clutch performer on the biggest stage of all: Game 7 of the NBA Finals, at home. Yet, he choked again. Kobe finished the game with 23 Points, of which he scored 11 from the free-throw line, thanks to receiving a ridiculous 15 free-throw attempts (ahem Referees? ahem). He scored 12 Points from the field on a awful 25% shooting, with just 1 Assist and 4 Turnovers, but did have a stellar 15 Rebounds. But thanks to the Referees (The Lakers got 20 more free-throws than the Celtics), the Lakers happened to win this game and Kobe won his 5th Ring. Compare these chokes with LeBron’s Finals: Game 4 performance against the Mavericks, which sparked conversation about LeBron being a Choke-Artist. LeBron put up a measly 8 Points on 27% shooting, but had 9 Rebounds and 7 Assists, therefore having about similar production as Kobe’s in the fore-mentioned games. Kobe has only ONE Regular Season MVP (Which he didn’t really deserve). Kobe Bryant has only one regular season MVP , which is put 12 players who have more MVPs than him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has done so 6 times. Michael Jordan has done so 5 times. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson have done so 3 times. Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry have done so 2 times. Kobe Bryant did win the 2007–2008 season, but did not deserve it. Let us take a look at Kobe’s stats, compared to other players’ performances. Kobe Bryant: 28.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG, 46% FG, 36% 3P, with a record 57–25. Chris Paul: 21.1 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 11.6 APG, 2.7 SPG, 0.1 BPG, 49% FG, 37%3P, with a record 56–26. LeBron James: 30.0 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG, 48% FG, 32% 3P, with the record 45–37. Amar’e Stoudemire: 25.2 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.1 BPG, 59% FG, 16% 3P, with the record 55–27. Kobe is an Extremely Inefficient player. Kobe Bryant has an Career Field Goal Percentage of 44.7%. Kobe Bryant, despite being a versatile scorer, has thelowest field goal percentageamong the Top 15 All-Time Career Scorers. Kobe Bryant has scored a total 33,643 Points, off 26,200 Shots. In Comparison, Karl Malone has scored a total of 36,928 Points, off 26,210 Shots. Which means, Karl Malone has taken 10 more shots than Kobe Bryant, but has scored 3,285 more points. Kobe has the Most Career Field Goals Missed. Kobe has missed 14,481 Shots in his career, which happens to be 1,064 more than the next player, John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant hold the record with the Most Missed Shotsin a single game with 30 while shooting just 36% against the Boston Celtics in 2002. In the Top 100 for most field goals missed in a game, Kobe hold 25 of those spots, making for a quarter of the total. Kobe Bryant is NOT a clutch player. Kobe does have some great moments in the clutch, but individual moments do not mean he is a great clutch performer. Kobe Bryant missed the last 15 straight game-tying/go-ahead FG in final 5 seconds of 4th quarter/OT of his career, and his last game-winner was in March 2012. Kobe Bryant has a Field-Goal Percentage of 29.1%, over his career, on game-tying or go ahead shots in the last 24 seconds of a game, over his career, only making 48 out of 164 attempts Kobe Bryant has received multiple Undeserved All-Star Selections. Kobe Bryant has been selected to the All-Star Game in the years 2014 and 2016, for which he was undeserving. He received these on the basis of legacy, rather than on performance. His stats for these seasons were: In 2014, Kobe Bryant played a total of 6 games, where he averaged just 13.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG and 6.3 APG. In 2016, Kobe averaged 17.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 2.8 APG. Kobe has been gifted Multiple Championships by Referees. Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, whether knowingly or unknowingly, have been subject to some of the most blatantly rigged NBA Playoff games, in history. 2002 Western Conference Finals In Game 6, of a tight western conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, where the reigning champion Lakers were facing elimination, the Lakers received a ridiculous27 Free-Throws, in the fourth quarter, compared to the Kings’ 9. Watch the video below to see for yourself: 2010 NBA Finals In Game 7 of the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics, Kobe shot a disgusting 6 of 24 from the field. However, thanks to the 15 Free-Throwshanded to him by the referees, compared to the whole Boston Celtics team got 17 Free-Throws, Kobe won his 5th Ring. Watch the following video to see yourself: Now I am not saying Kobe is not a legend, I am simply saying that he is given much more credit than some of his more deserving contemporaries. He deserves to be compared to players like John Stocktonand Reggie Miller who are fantastic players, but NOT All-Time Greats like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Tough question because most basketball experts do not overrate him. Most place him somewhere in the top 10–15. That’s about right. But most young basketball fans do overrate him. Many put him in the top 5. Those that do usually do not have strong knowledge of basketball history; usually overrate individual play; and usually overrate athleticism. Players that are definitely ahead of Kobe: Jordan, Magic Johnson, Jabbar, Russell, Chamberlain, Lebron James In my view, none of these are worth debating versus Kobe. Players that are probably ahead of Kobe: Duncan, O’Neal, Bird, Olajuwon, Robertson Players that are close and/or may finish their careers as close: West, Durant, Curry, Moses Malone So, in my view, Kobe is 12th at highest. Or somewhere in the 10–14 range. That’s still great. So what I say next does not diminish him but only puts him in context versus the other great players. Kobe Bryant is definitely the most selfish and least likable teammate of anyone on the list. (Chamberlain is close on the selfish front. Robertson is close on the least likable front). When I engage in these discussions with my fellow GMs, we set up the ground rule as who would I want on my team for 5 years. This is an important distinction because character/personality become increasingly important over time. Indeed, Kobe would likely be in the top ten if this was a single game or single series. Shaq is another guy that loses ground in this area. At his peak, he was crazy dominant but his laziness and selfishness are draining after a period of time. As a contrast, Duncan and Magic are rated higher than their athleticism might indicate because they are the ultimate team guys. But Kobe’s character deflates his teammates, unlike the majority of those ahead of him who elevate their teammates. Over time, team chemistry decreases. And, of course, losses or implosion occur. Is Kobe overrated by young NBA fans, yes.  "

I mean he is never talked about and he is playing as well as any point guard not named Stephen Curry.
"So thats a great example, would you rather have stephen curry or james harden, sure harden has played more games but I'd rather have curry's greatness. Or equally kawhi leonard, a guys thats never played a full season but he is more likely to lead you to a championship then westbrook a guy that plays 80 games every year but does not get you any closer to the ultimate goal. Greatness most of the time vs mediocrity all of the time, one wins you a champion ship while the other sees you fighting it out for the 5-8th seed hoping you don't get swept in the first round."
"How can people say KD is more dominant? The warriors are where they are because of Steph. KD has rings right now because he couldn’t get it done on his own in OKC, so he joined Steph. KD would probably be ringles if he didn’t join Steph’s team. Curry absolutely revolutionized the sport in a way that KD hasn’t. We’re talking about a two time MVP, and the first and only unanimous MVP. We’re talking about the best shooter in the history of the sport. Steph’s impact on the Warriors is grossly underrated by most fans, and loyalty aside, Steve Ker would 100% let KD walk before Curry. He’s more integral to the team and plays like no one has ever played before in the history of basketball. KD is an incredible player, but he plays on a team run by Stephen Curry."
"""Stephen Curry shouldn't be remembered as an all time great NBA player cuz he has great teammates."""
Imagine watching a red hot KD pull up from the logo...when he misses the shot you sigh in relief before seeing the ball go straight to Stephen fucking Curry for a wide open 3. 
Kevin Durant missed a long 3 and it bounced back to an open Stephen Curry for a wide open 3 was like GIF summarizing the Warriors to the whole NBA. 
This is a hot take but the warriors are really good because they also have Kevin Durant aside from Stephen Curry. 
"if that's the case then you also have to take into consideration that Curry has much better teammates than John Stockton did leading to a higher pass to assist ratio than LeBron and CP3. Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson are some of the best Shooters in NBA history who Curry has the privilege of passing to. So you have to look at the whole picture not just stats. Therefore my point stands that I believe John Stockton, CP3, Magic Johnson,Jason Kidd,and Steve Nash are better passers than Stephen Curry.   Don't get me wrong Stephen Curry is freaking amazing but let's not blind ourselves or get overzealous here. I fully recognize however that he is the greatest pure shooter in NBA history and his ability to score is ridiculous."

Jamal Crawford 2,154  Curry will be 3rd all time by the end of this season (his 10th) since passing Reggie this year would mean making more than he made in his record-breaking 2015-2016 season. Reggie would get passed next year, Ray Allen likely the next. Allen and Miller both played 18 seasons; Curry will have topped them both in 12. If Curry plays 18 and continues even close to his current career season average, he will lead the 3-pointers made category by at least a thousand. He'll probably end up leading Ray Allen by more 3s than guys like Manu, JJ Redick, Brent Barry, Baron Davis, and Allan Houston made *in their career*.  Dude is insane."

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Stephen. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.

"Why is David Stern publicly crying about how none of the mediocre to trash players acquired from a horrible trade HE effectively forced and signed off on, that happened over 8 years ago, are still on the Pelicans? The only reason that trade isn't rightfully ridiculed as one of the worst in league history is because he went and rigged the draft immediately after so that NOLA would get the #1 pick in the upcoming draft to cover for his hilariously pathetic decision making in vetoing the Lakers trade and turning down others from different teams.   Keep in mind that a certain team called the Warriors were offering two guys named Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson in a potential trade for CP3 around that time... why doesn't someone ask Stern what compelled him to turn down THAT trade in favor of the Clippers offer of Aminu and Eric fucking Gordon lmao.

Of the 13 players above him, only 2 take more shots in the paint than he does. That’s a discrepancy, but it gets worse.  LeBron is 18th when it comes to FTA after attempting a shot within 6 feet of the rim, only 7.4% of the time does he go to the line. Here’s some players who have a higher % than that: Eric Gordon, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Jeramy Grant, Bradley Beal, Caris LeVert, Nikola Jokic, Lauri Markkanen, Dwight Howard, and others. "

"Enforcing a bad rule doesn't make it good just as enforcing an unjust law doesn't make it just.   There is some ""touchy, feely"" type stuff especially on close late game inbounds that, while not a big deal imo since games that close should be decided by *the players*, is fine if they call when it happens because technically its ramped up to 11 only in those instances and for consistency sake, you can't argue against calling it for 48 minutes versus 46.   However, You should certainly be allowed to put your arms across and touching a player with the defenders back towards them to prevent them moving forward, similar to boxing out for a rebound for example. There is nothing wrong nor dangerous about that. If the rule prevents something like that, then it is simply nonsensical and unnecessary. Defense can't be 100% cerebral as far as its effectiveness - as in, only the act of conditioning your opponent to *think* what you are doing actually affects them rather than it just being an illusion. If you cannot touch them, then there is no real threat, no way for you to actually affect their offense, and any player which lacks that fear can go off unimpeded.   A great example of this in practice is Stephen Curry during the pre and post-air space rule eras. As soon as a rule was put into place making it ridiculously safe to land, by all intents and purposes making guarding them almost impossible since your body needs to be to their side if closing out to guarantee a no-call, he started putting up historical numbers because *he no longer had anything to fear.* That's also around the time the league became a ""shoot first, get to the basket second"" league and when GS with no traditional inside presence became the first team to ""live and die by the three"" to become league champions.  All this happened after that rule was implemented. Rules shouldn't change the fundamental thesis of a game, especially not just *one* rule.  It's a slap in the face to its history, to those who worked hard to be the best and overcame/adjusted to those rules and the adversity that brought. It's a lack of respect for the institution. And enforcing this unnecessary rule about contact off the ball is yet another example of them attempting to undermine the fundamentals of the game *as it's been played for generations.* It's an attempt to make Defense nothing but something ""in your head.""  And if you aren't able to scare them, then you have zero options as far as what you can actually do to prevent a basket. It's just not healthy for the integrity of the game or of competition in general."
I would personally take Stephen Curry at PF in that case.

"So in your clip there's a total of two people who said Kobe was up there with Jordan (David Stern had a financial incentive to say it and Mark Jackson was still saying foolishly that he would eventually go down as the best). There were people saying he was good, but not better and a few clips where we don't even know the context. There were people talking about only him and Jordan making certain shots, but that's not who's better. It's funny how supposedly he was already just as good if not better than Jordan and yet somehow he wouldn't even make most top-5 lists at this point even though LeBron is the only new addition.  You keep mistaking people saying that one day he might possibly, if everything goes right for many more years, be better than Jordan with people saying he actually was. I can say Ben Simmons might possibly eventually be better than Jordan, but to say he is would be a joke just like it was when people said it about Kobe who in the end never really got that close. [Some people](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/02/09/michael-jordan-lebron-james-stephen-curry-nba-greatest) don't even have Kobe in [the top-10. ](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/ranking-the-25-greatest-players-in-nba-history-100716).  Once again, you are confusing the concept of ""he might eventually have a chance to get into the conversation if everything goes right"" with ""he's already in the conversation now."" Well unless it's the part of the conversation where it's made clear that he was not there yet.   Let me ask you, if he was already right up there with Jordan halfway through his career, what did he do to in the end not really even be close? What part of his career was actually so negative that it went from 1a and 1b to Kobe not even being top-5? The reason is that nothing happened because he was never 1b and because any of the conversation was about what he might eventually become, not what he actually was."

Yes Stephen Adam's is a great rebounder, but if they were running a 7sol offense, he would never have the time to get in position for a rebound, running an offensive set that allows him to set a pick and then roll towards the rim with inside position is good coaching.

The per game and per 100poss are very similar, however the advanced stat table tells a different story. While scoring a bit less, Steph beats him in almost every single category.  So imo what he has to do to win this season is:  1. Get at least 3rd seed, while the Pelicans get at least 2 seeds lower than POR. 2. 78+ GP, top 2 in scoring, top 7 in assists 3. Get a 10+ win streak going for POR, preferably after the ASG. 4. Be as consistent as possible and hit quite a few game winners."

Even then, I wouldn't mind having LaVine / Kemba / Booker on my team. Mirotic I'm always iffy on cause he can hit 30ppg and then go for 8 points tomorrow night and ruin that average.

"Jason Kidd, John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Stephen Curry, and Steve Nash were able to make their mark in the NBA without necessarily always being the best players on their team.  Kidd had Dirk, Stockton had Malone, Magic had KAJ, Curry has had KD, and Nash also had Dirk.  CP3 has hitherto put every team he has ever led on his back and has done so as far as his injury-prone could take them. For this reason alone, not making the Finals is hardly a blemish.

So asking if any of those last 5 players are in the ""top 5"" overall is a tricky question, every one of them over the past year has been at a point where most people would put them in the top 5.

Ayesha said [some things](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/10/13/ayesha-curry-stephen-curry-foot-fetish) about Steph liking feet last year. The jury is still out on if she was joking or not.
"Did you know that this girl, Riley Morrison, has the same amount of Finals MVP's as Stephen Curry? "

""For his size, Steph is ridiculous strong.""  &gt; Only center Festus Ezeli, who stands about seven feet and 270 pounds, can top Curry on that particular lift. That may be hard to believe, but that core power is the secret that unlocks Curry's magic.  &gt; ""We knew he was strong,"" Lyles says, ""but when he started pushing that kind of weight, I was like 'This guy is just a freak.'""

"I'd rather have 3 Pointers than Big Men dominating the paint.  Basketball was always and still is a Big People Game. I think the faster pace and the higher athletism is good for the game. Yeah, we dont have the Big 7 Footers in the Center with no Basketball Skills at all anymore and that's a good thing.  That Stephen Curry with 6'3 (191cm) which is considered small dominates is the right direction. I think it's a good trend when we see more JJ Bareas and less Shawn Bradleys."
You and I have as many Finals MVPs as Stephen Curry
"I love this idea and I have jackshit to do at work for another hour so here goes...  &amp;#x200B;  Klay Thompson goes to the Detroit Pistons!  Detroit has two star big men and two solid point guards(on paper, DET fans please tell me if I'm wrong) but they need better wing play/shooting. This move keeps Point Blake going in full effect and gives him, Drummond, and Jackson much more space to operate in.  &amp;#x200B;  DeMarcus Cousins goes to the Washington Wizards!  Wall and Boogie reunited. Plus we get to see the team chemistry of Wall, Beal, Porter, Boogie, Dwight Howard, Austin Rivers, and Jeff Green all mixed together(!)  &amp;#x200B;  Stephen Curry goes to the Phoenix Suns!  Curry, Booker, Bridges, Warren, Ayton. That's really fun. Plus the Suns literally do not have a PG. This team isn't winning the title, but it'll be fun as hell.  &amp;#x200B;  Draymond Green goes to the Dallas Mavericks!  Draymond Green and DeAndre Jordan. No one is scoring in the paint. You're just not.  &amp;#x200B;  Kevin Durant goes to the Charlotte Hornets!  Kemba finally gets a running partner and it just so happens to be one of the best players of all-time."
"Healthy Johnny Flynn could be like Darren Collison, perhaps even better player and Ricky Rubio was overhyped in 2009.

Cook often asks Kerr during a free-throw or dead-ball situation what play he should run. Curry usually just improvises."

"Tracy McGrady -&gt; Kobe Bryant -&gt; Stephen Curry  After 2013 there were a lot of players trying to take Kobe's inevitable open spot. (Conley, Noah, and Marc Gasol) but Curry took the spot. "
"He has Stephen Curry shot selection without the skill, which is why his 3 point percentage is so low. I just see him shoot like 3-5 feet behind the arc constantly because he's open, but there are few players that you wouldn't leave open at that distance and he's not one of them at the moment. "
Hotter take - Towns can easily post up Stephen Curry deep in the post.
"&gt;But ok, where does Beal come into play? Why can’t he step up if people see John as a bad leader? Why is he always seen as the little brother who is just along for the ride?  He has stepped up. He's the best player on the team and it's most valuable player. But you cant get past the fact that John is it's most talented and the guy who is the engine every night because he's the PG. John trying = win. Because Beal is already trying.    &gt;You think he handled the ‘Everybody Eats’ stuff well when John was out?   Yeah, he did. He said exactly the right things. Where'd you get the impression that he didn't?   &gt;How about when he complains about low energy play while being just as lethargic as John oftentimes  He's literally never close to as lethargic or inconsistent as anyone else on the team. This team has John/Morris/Oubre/Otto/etc and ALL those guys are literally a gamble for whether the play with shit effort or not.    &gt;Like I said earlier, I love Beal but I just don’t think he  necessarily has the “it” factor. For a championship caliber team, I don’t think he could be the #2 option unless you have an all world player like Lebron. I just sorta see Beal as a ‘9-5 player’.   Fine if that's what you think. I kinda agree. Unless he can sink his freethrows at 85+% he will always be as you describe him.   &gt;He’ll show up, play his best and do his job, but he may not go that extra step.   Wait what? Now you're switching gears and saying he does show up and play his best? Lol. Well, I agree again. He's the only player who's not a rollercoaster of effort.     &gt;I don’t think you can necessarily count on him to be a leader or really doing the dirty work to fix whatever is wrong with the Wizards.   Some things can't be fixed. Like a Wizards franchise that is fucked up because of Ernie Grunfeld. All the players in the locker room look at the waste of cap that Mahinmi is. All of them look at the dozens of wasted picks thrown away. All of them know Otto is overpaid and should be someone like Paul George. All of them know their team is hamstrung for good.   You can't count on anyone to fix anybody else's problem. But Beal takes care of his own end. He deserves to be on a team where everyone takes care of their own job. Same can't be said for Wall. Wall floats into controversy every single week. He takes flak rightfully for a lack of effort and stupid play. He only plays hard when he feels disrespected or motivated to perform.  You think the Raptors are a top seed every year because they're talented? No. It's cause everyone does their job. Lowry or Derozan didn't carry anyone. They showed up with effort, and the bench matched them. The coaching enabled them.   &gt;John is a leader, albeit not the best one. I don’t think Beal is one and that’s not a good look for an all star and has an impact on a team, especially when there is a leadership vacuum.    Whatever man, if you think he can somehow be a leader on a team that clearly belongs to someone else more vocal. Sometimes the best leadership is not running your mouth and then showing up and slacking off. Durant nor Curry are leaders by any means but they're both top 3 players. Kyrie isn't a leader, and he certainly can't be next to LeBron. He can't fix the problems LeBron creates. And damn well not K. Love. Wade couldn't be a leader when LeBron showed up. And damn well not Bosh. They all just shut up and played hard on the court and the teams won.   &gt;I see that all of that as knock on Beal since he is supposed to be the 1b of the Wizards.   Well, there you have it. While you managed to criticize Beal's shortcomings as a leader, you really couldn't ever pull up a time Beal has **actually** hamstrung this franchise. I can't either.  **The question was - ""Has Beal ever made negative news?""**  - No. The franchise is happy with his effort, the press are, the fanbase is grateful, and he shows up to play every night. Besides a freethrow shot that isn't where it should be, Beal leaves you nothing to write about. He improved in every facet of the game. He's always in shape. He's a better slasher now than a shooter even. He plays off-ball, he passes, and he plays defense. He plays smart and has very few bone-headed plays. He's the best offensive weapon. And he hasn't even been injured in 4 years.   He has 0 bad press on a team where every player is roasted for something or another every week. Stephen A Smith and ESPN might find a storyline on any guy in the roster, but they won't on Beal. "
I bet you were calling Stephen Curry the greatest PG ever that season before he won his first MVP when he’d kinda arrived.   Relax a bit. Let things play out. 
Is that Jonny Flynn or Stephen Jackson under Eddy Curry?
When you are shooting over 60 percent you better be a Stephen curry-esqe 3 point shooter.
Which means he gets attacked more on offense other than Stephen Curry.

I miss Stephen curry.
"honestly i think hes just injured. im not a curry fan but i cannot deny his pure skill and relentless  kd would be relentless if he didnt join the team that beat him and wasnt mentally soft..   his mom used to push him to get better he didnt want to get better by him say okay i want to get better thats pretty sad tbh   thats why andre said i want to push him to become the best player he needs that push . even some role players can be relentless like robert convington man is always great on defense always shoots the 3 plays high level always is giving it everything he has jimmy butler , steve kerr according to tim was relentless a lot of players in this day and age are soft but i would say matt barnes , stephen jackson , dennis rodman , most players these days are soft "
So you're telling me he shoots like Stephen but small like IT?  ..... but [dude's 6'3 no](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/forbebr01.html)? That's pretty decent at PG since that's Curry size.

You're missing the point of the post dude.... lol.. I'll explain.   Trae Young coming into the draft was touted as a 3 points specialist because of how well he shot the ball in college. He was compared to Stephen Curry often times. 1.3 3PM is low compared to what he was expected to bring and 1 in the last 5 games is also very low compared to his expectations.    Hopefully that makes sense.

"Well Curry is not only good at shooting threes, he is good overall in the offense spectrum. He shoots at a high % even for his 2pters and shoots a high percent on the line. But the fact that when hes on the floor your team is going to score more points just based off the fact that you have Stephen Curry on the damn floor. The other teams have to react to this, and their reactions usually lead to more points scored by the team or Stephen Curry. More points = offense. He is also scoring at 29.5pts per game right now according to his stats. In conclusion, stephen curry is a top offensive player. Sorry to educate."

"' With Curry rolling solo, the Warriors are still plus-14.3 in 216 minutes of action. That’s without the help of an MVP, a former Defensive Player of the Year and perhaps the second-greatest shooter ever not named Stephen Wardell Curry. The offense scores 116.6 points per 100 possessions in these lineups, which would be the league-leading offensive rating this season. '  &amp;#x200B;  This is so wrong.. Steph's name is Wardell Stephen Curry II not Stephen Wardell Curry and if Klay is the 'perhaps second-greatest shooter not named Stephen Wardell Curry', who is the 1st? What a horrible paragraph for a columnist.  &amp;#x200B;  Kind of ironic that he's actually correct in that Klay is the 2nd greatest shooter not named Stephen Wardell Curry, because Wardell Stephen Curry II is 1st."

"I like how you picked out a career average when Steph was injured for 2 seasons after his rookie year and was clearly 2 different players during 13-14 and beyond. When you evaluate a player with one of the biggest transformations in league history, taking the average is clearly not an accurate methodology.  Since BBall reference won't let me compare their bundle of peak years, lets compare their individual peak years.  Here's Steph's best season (15-16) to CP3s best season (08-09)  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;y1=2016&amp;player_id2_hint=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id2_select=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id2=paulch01&amp;y2=2009  per 36, The gap in scoring is massive, with CP markedly less efficient, and even if you assume his 3 additional assists are all 3 pointers, it still doesn't account for a 10 point gap on higher efficiency. And before you say we can't use per 36 - we have to, because Steph was blowing every team out so badly he sat before the 3rd quarter finished.   In advanced stats its the same. BPM, WS per 48, PER, VORP etc. I'm sure there are some CP beats Curry but overall it's not particularly close.  The playoff figures are not even close it's not worth comparing.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id2_hint=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id2_select=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id2=paulch01&amp;y2=2018  Here's a comparison of their most recent season (CP3s best playoff run). Here Curry played more minutes than CP3 so a per36 comparison would be more fair to CP3.    Again, 8.6 additional points on significantly higher efficiency. Even if you assume his 2.1 additional assists are all 3 pointers, it still doesn't account for the point gap on 7.1% higher efficiency.  BPM, WS/48, VORP ... I could go on. Again, obviously some areas CP will surpass curry, but even without taking into account the doubles Curry draw from Halfcourt and the hockey assists he accumulates, the scoring gap is just too for any measurable advanced stats to make up.  And if you're really ever in doubt, his individual accolades (MVPs) as reflected by the voting of journalists reflect him as better. The GMs survey recorded for the past 4 years suggests that 'people who know their basketball and who's job is to learn basketball' overwhelmingly value Stephen Curry as the best point guard over CP3.  Proof: http://www.nba.com/gmsurvey/2018   http://www.nba.com/gmsurvey/2017 http://www.nba.com/gmsurvey/2016 (4th year is shown in the last year part)  I can't find any survey before that time but I think my point is pretty clear.

"I have to agree with both of your moments they were the two most incredible NBA games I have watched live on TV.   My most happiest moment watching basketball has to be last year Warriors at Timberwolves because it was my first ever NBA game in person. It was a 15 hour drive in good weather but It took 2 days as I got stuck in the worst snowstorm of the year and had a terrible cold for the whole trip. Also missed going to clippers-wolves the night before because of this. Everything was going wrong for my trip of the year, and almost had to take the loss and head home which was extremely disheartening. stayed positive waited out the snowstorm and highways to be cleared from 8ft snowdrifts and made it to Minneapolis.  Finally arriving and going to the arena and seeing the NBA players such as Stephen Curry, KAT, Steve Kerr etc. in person, taking in the whole arena experience, having incredible seats right behind Timberwolves bench, having the game be close and exciting going right to the buzzer, was the best and happiest moment of my life especially since it was so very close to not being possible because of uncontrollable circumstances."

"The release is slow and low. He has a hitch. It looks totally different than it did at Washington, and it's not for the better. Here's [another angle.](https://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/951525775647395840) You can get by with a low release, as you alluded to. Stephen Curry's is fairly low, but Curry has a lightning-quick release and is an outlier level ball handler. Fultz's shot was fine before and could've just used a slight tweak from where he was. But now, it's like starting over when he never had to."
"They were down 7 with 2 minutes to go in Ot in game 1 when Kyrie got hurt, they would have lost that game regardless.  Iggy and Green can guard Lebron, Iggy literally won FMVP just for it.

In 2016 Okc had a better staring lineup with 2 superstar and 3 bordeline all-star and Kanter in the bench, they coulnd win 1 single game in the regular season, and blowed a 3-1 lead in the playoffs, even with Stephen Curry not being full healthy, and they were the biggest threat to the Warriors, after 2016 get out of the West, would get even easier for the Warriors.  And do you forgot that the Warriors were up 3-1, to the Cavs?  They just loss because they lost they only rim protection in Bogut in game 5, Kerr had to give time to fucking Varejao in Speight in the fucking finals  Yeah Kyrie did outplayed him in 2016 we gotta give him credit for that even if Curry wasnt a 100%, he was way underwhelming to say the least.

Also I feel like every player looks a little slower that late in the season and it could be confirmation bias that makes him appear slowed by injury. Also I did little digging and most articles about the injury seem to say he was expected to be out for two weeks, not a month.  https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/25/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-sprain-two-weeks-injury-knee  http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-sprained-knee-could-miss-2-weeks-2016-4"
Stephen Curry
"WARNING : it's a long one  Durant has been ruled out of tonight's game, and the last time Denver was in town, they spanked us, we couldn't make a shot all night... All that has me thinking that Curry is gonna go off tonight.  Nuggets are 5-5 over the last 10 games, with a bad loss against Sacramento 2 days ago. I have a feeling this is gonna be the most competitive game against Denver this year.   Some thoughts on the game :  * Game is fast paced, which is expected when those two teams face each other. The passing game, from both team, is beautiful that tiki taka between Zaza &amp; Dray was awesome. And on top of it, Dre made a three.  * Harris has managed to lose the Dubs defense a couple times already, he really has a Klay like style of play, remarkable off ball player and some people thought giving him an extension was a mistake.  * Loving the Curry/Dray PnR tonight, when Dray is aggressive like that and goes to the rim instead of settling for outside shots, it opens so much, for himself, but also for Steph.  * That block by Curry was so clean, how did that get called, maybe it looked like it from a different angle, but that was a great defensive rotation by Steph. He's struggling offensively but he makes up for it with effort and intensity.  * 37-28 at the end of the 1st, Bell had a huge block, an Oreb followed by an and one, great effort from the rookie. 12 out of our 15 FG have been assisted, only 2 TOs, great quarter from the Dubs.  * Curry's heading to the locker room, Beasley fell onto him when he went for the block at the end of the 1st, hope everything's good, apparently it's the knee, please don't be serious.  * Second unit is doing the job, once again lead by the forever young David West with 4 points 4 boards in 4 minutes, he's so impressive this season. Dray with 6 assists already too, love seeing those two together this year.  * Jokic is such an aazing passer, he is known for that most of all but damn the pass he threw this quarter were all perfectly timed and placed. Denver's defense is all over the place right now, we're getting too much open looks with the second unit.  * Steph is back in the game, left knee strain I believe Kerith said. Hope they aren't taking a risk right there, but I trust the coaching staff not to fuck around with injuries, especially this year.  * Oooh that foul by Dray on Jokic shooting a three with 1.7 second left on the clock was really dumb. Dray has a great BBIQ but he often does those infuriating little things. Steph's knee looks fine, thankfully. Murray just put Dre on skates, that was nasty.  * 64-57 at halftime, both teams are playing some really good basketball, game is clean and fun to watch. only 9 TOs across both teams. We had a great offensive half, defense wasn't quite there, need to stop the cuts, we're not tight enough on that end.  * Jokic as some amazing moves man, he got Dray on the low post and had fun with him. He's also really dangerous playing at the high post controlling other players and getting them nice looks. He's feasting on the Dubs.  * 3 TOs in 3 minutes out of the locker room... They did a great job taking care of the ball in the first half, here in the 3rd they seem to have some miscommunication over where the player should be to receive the pass, Klay cut inside and Curry threw the ball into the corner.  * When two players are going shot for shot, it's called a shootout, what is the name for two players doing that but with great assists ? Pass off ? Pass out ? let me know because that's some nice plays we're seeing. The Jokic touch pass to Plumlee was insane.  * One of this team's greatest asset is the unselfishness of every player, but it sometimes can be their worst enemy, we're trying too much to find the perfect pass for the perfect shot that it is actually costing us.  * 93-81 at the end of the 3rd, two baskets in a row from Swaggy P and a Curry three from DEEEP and what was a seemingly dangerous lead turns into a 12 points game, this team is really incredible in its ability to just fuck you up in an instant.  * Lots of people (me included) were fast on calling the Utah-Denver trade that ended up being Mitchell for Lyles a bad trade for Denver, but that gave them a guy off the bench that can really change the state of the game, he's been awesome this season.  * Some amazing last few possessions from the Dubs to give an 18 points lead. Casspi steal and then goes coast to coast for the slam, and then Shaun stuffs Lyles and receives the ball at the other end for the easy lay-up, defense has been way better in the 4th.  * Jokic has a triple double for the night, in a losing effort but damn some of the passes he threw were beautiful. Him, Harris and Lyles were great tonight.  * 11-2 run for the Nuggets, Draymond passed on the easiest lay-up ever in transition for a Curry three but it didn't go in, some would call it dumb, maybe it was, but he's passing it to the best shooter ever so I don't know what to make of it.  * Thought he would use a bit of Kevon Looney tonight, with Bell jumping on every pump fake, you'd think he put in the guy that stays on his feet most of the times. Maybe he's inactive, haven't checked.  * Nuggets come back within two possessions, lots of turnovers down the stretch might cost us this one. They're defending way better towards the end of the game.  Overall, what a great game to watch, both teams ball movement is just a treat. Warriors big 3 &amp; bench was on point tonight, another 30+ assists game. Denver is developing and without Millsap, they're gonna be scarier and scarier in the years to come  Next one is against the Clippers at Oracle a.k.a the Stephen Curry show, I'm ready for a lot of highlights.  GG Denver bros (Jokic, Harris and Lyles are so good) &amp; Good night everyone."

"I made a thread early this morning about how championship experience should factor into trade value. So while TT and Shump seem like shitty overpaid players, you can probably recoup some of that money by flashing ""NBA champions"" on advertisements and sell season ticket holders who dont really know shit about ball aside from the basics and LeBron being the best player in the league.   And then you add the Brooklyn pick who, to me, is gonna land Trae Young who is being touted as the next Stephen Curry."
"#1 LeBron JAMES . . . #2 Kevin Durant #3 Stephen Curry  #4 Kawhi Leonard #5 Russel Westbrook #6 James Harden #7 Giannis Atentokompo ?? #6 Anthony Davis #8 Irving #9 Chris Paul #10 Paul George #11 Jimmy Butler #12 Demarcus Cousins  The Reason why i put some gap space between LeBron and KD to Others. Coz in my opinion. there no player that so close LeBron Right Now. I cant put him KD on SAME PLACE. coz i always think KD have some ease to win with his talent behind. not saying LeBron Have not enough talent with his back. but if you know some basketball you know what im saying. though.. its just my only OPINION. . And the Reason why I put Cousins Last because he is the only player i mention did not reach playoffs. yes he have some bad teamates over his stay at kings. but i think at some point to be  a great player sometimes u must lead your team in playoff berth perhaps. hes a great player thou.."" sorry for my bad english ."""
"[Article about it] (http://www.espn.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/12023932/tyson-chandler-dallas-mavericks-swats-shoe-air-golden-state-warriors)  It's apparently not illegal.  &gt;""It was tactical for sure,"" said Chandler, who recorded 11 points, 12 rebounds and one blocked shoe in the loss. ""You can't run with a sock on. I was hoping that we could exploit that on the other end until they had to call a timeout or he had to foul, either or. But we didn't take advantage of it.  &gt;""I'm doing everything to try to win. I don't care what it is, if it's hitting a shoe or hitting whatever it is.""  &gt;The shoe swat wasn't enough to help Dallas overcome a 28-point deficit, a hole the Mavs mostly dug by giving up 39 points in the first quarter.  &gt;""That was probably the [Mavs'] best defensive play of the night,"" Dallas power forward Dirk Nowitzki deadpanned.  &gt;Speights had lost his shoe a couple of possessions earlier, stepping out of it as he attempted to drive. He played an entire possession with just a sock on his left foot. Golden State guard Stephen Curry tried to help out his teammate, picking up the shoe and passing it to Speights near midcourt as the Warriors brought the ball up the court.  &gt;Spotting the shoe in the air, Chandler changed direction and swatted it away with his left hand, drawing roars from the sellout crowd at the American Airlines Center and confused shrugs and points from Speights and Curry.  &gt;""That's crazy,"" said Speights, who retrieved his shoe from the front row. ""He didn't get in trouble for that? No tech or anything? Hey, they thought it was going to help them, but I guess it didn't.""  &gt;The swat also caught Curry by surprise.  &gt;""When I was on the wing, and I saw the shoe, and I immediately thought about my ankles, so I thought, 'I got to pick that up before I try to make that move,'"" Curry said. ""On the other transition, when he went to go get his shoe back, but Tyson thought um, otherwise, I guess. I've never seen that happen before.""  &gt;**It's not illegal**, although Warriors coach Steve Kerr half-jokingly suggested that the league office should consider changing that.  "

"Klay doesn't donate like Draymond and Klay does chase sponsorships, he's a good guy and a good teammate but I don't see him giving up a lot of money on his contract. He likes money. KD did give up a ton of money but IIRC it's only after this season that his bird rights will kick in with the Warriors, so his baseline will go way up, discount or not, and he might want a long term deal. Whatever KD signs next off-season will be a good indicator of how things might go. It was only really the weird revenue jumps that allowed us to sign a 4th max player, I don't see how we could possibly replace one with a player like AD unless there was another huge cap jump.   I think we'll probably have to package Iggy with a pick to get rid of him and Ownership will still need to be willing to eat a massive luxury tax in order to keep our core 4 around.   &gt; I'm getting way off topic here but basically I think Stephen Curry has already done enough amazing things on NBA courts to be highly ranked all time, I think he's got several seasons more of it to come, and I think the Warriors are going to be in contention for titles for several more seasons, not just because of the players but because of the ownership and their front office.  I agree with all of this, I guess we just have different definitions of ""highly ranked"". I have high hopes for this team and think they're still capable of great things, but it's not going to come without challenges IMO. "

"Warriors don't really have that many money issues. We've got Klay through this season and the next before he has to be resigned and he's already on record saying:  &gt;""If it's a few million,"" he said about a potential discount to Marcus Thompson II and Tim Kawakami of The Athletic. Thompson added: ""It's a blessing whatever contract I sign. I would definitely consider it 'cause I don't want to lose anybody.""  Now of course it's easy to say that and it doesn't mean it will be true come 2019 but if you look at Draymond's last contract he certainly could have squeezed the Warriors for more but he took what he felt was fair and didn't take every last penny he could have. I think the culture the new ownership, Meyers, Kerr and even Curry has developed there has a value of its own that some players are willing to give up some money to play there. We've seen it before in other organizations, like Dirk giving money to compete in Dallas, Tim Duncan giving money to compete in San Antonio, right now that is what appears to be happening in Golden State. We've seen it with KD, sacrificing $10m that wasn't even strictly necessary to resign key reserves but made the tax situation around their resigning a lot more bearable.   The next guy to be resigned will be Draymond in 2020, and that one is trickier. Of all our all stars Draymond's game may fall off the quickest with age and knowing that it may be his last big contract he may not want to give up too much. That may force the Warriors into a tough position.   But, the Warriors are big on planning ahead and I'm sure they've got all possible circumstances mapped out. They've made very heads up moves going back to pretty much when the new ownership came in and brought in guys like Jerry West and Meyers. They've done better than average with their picks. As long as they are contenders they are going to be a premier destination for guys looking to win rings. So let's say Draymond gets to be too expensive. You know who'll be a free agent then? Anthony Davis. He's talked before about players getting ignored if they aren't winning, the Pelicans have been trash for years, and if that situation doesn't improve I could totally see AD going to the Warriors. Which would trigger a wailing and gnashing of teeth to be sure.   I'm getting way off topic here but basically I think Stephen Curry has already done enough amazing things on NBA courts to be highly ranked all time, I think he's got several seasons more of it to come, and I think the Warriors are going to be in contention for titles for several more seasons, not just because of the players but because of the ownership and their front office. "
"No but saying he wouldn't do as well on a shit team is underrating him that's all I'm saying and you literally said that he would not be as good if not on the Warriors so don't try to change your argument to surpass MJ now.   Doesn't matter if his team is shit, He would literally just do more. If he's double teamed as hard as you say every fucking possession, he's still gonna get free assists. This isn't Austin Rivers this is Stephen Curry, He's gonna steal your ball and shoot it from 25 feet in your face at the buzzer and if you double him he's just gonna dribble through your whole team and lay it in ? I'm sure you've watched enough of him (maybe not I don't know), especially before Durant came, to know that he can single handily Carry. The guy had the best offensive season of all time sitting half the 4th quarters, effortlessly dominating the entire league to the best record ever (again, sitting the 4th Q most of the time). "

"Stephen Curry only played 4 more games than CP3, so I don’t see why CP3 is not allowed to make it. Also no one would be talking about how Draymond was snubbed, because he doesn’t deserve to be an all star and no one watches the all star game for Draymond Green."

You know how Harden would drive to the rim looking for contact on any layup? That's Gil's strategy to get to the line.  He was never the best PG in the league (not when Allen Iverson, Steve Nash and Jason Kidd were also around their peaks), but he was a score-first PG in a league full of them at the time.

Overall, I agree Kyrie is definitely better than Butler, disagree that he's better than Harden. It's hard for anyone other than Steph to touch Harden this year, really."
Yeah but what about Stephen Curry
Kevin Durant went to Golden State BECAUSE of Stephen Curry. 
"It would be a lot of the same players every year, and many players would be left out entirely.  Remember: this means no LeBron James (high school), no Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece), no Stephen Curry (Davidson).  Just to name a few."
"So you think Stephen Curry is making the kind of shots DeMar does with a defender fouling him in the midrange?  Steph is definitely better at open mids, he is not close to DeMar from mid when contested.  You can't teach being 6'7."

"goddamn it, i saw that they ranked him 7th [here](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/18/cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-named#/), but he's joint 7th with everyone else who didn't get a vote smh😂😂"
"I'll take the greatest scorer since Michael Jordan (KD) over Stephen curry to an offense everytime. Steph is by no means a System player but Golden State's offense, (having bigs who can pass Draymond and Zaza, back then Bogut and Lee) putting curry off the ball a lot does Steph a world of good, it's the reason why Golden State went to the next level. OKC in the Durant era say 2011-2016 (when healthy) were never worse than the 6th best Offense (top 5 most of the time). Do you know how stagnant that Scott brooks offense was? Although Westbrook played a big role, Durant is what made that offense efficient.   I could go on and on but I'll leave a video here from late 2014 (beginning of Steve kerr era) comparing it to mark Jackson's offense and how curry's gifts are maximised especially off-ball https://youtu.be/o3sC6-f3q9E"
It's called Stephen Curry.
"Well, the Top 10 for 3's made this season are:  * Klay Thompson  * James Harden  * Eric Gordon  * Paul George  * Wayne Ellington  * Lou Williams  * Stephen Curry  * Kyle Lowry  * Kyrie Irving  * C.J. McCollum  Of which only maybe Ellington is considered a player who only ""jack up 3's all game."" I personally think that a lot of the players are more skilled today and can do multiple things on the court. I grew up watching the NBA from the 80's to today, ever era is super talented. This era has great athletes that can also shot the ball at a high rate.  Now, when bad shooters are shooting the ball a ton from three that is tough to watch. I 1000% agree with you if you are talking about that."
"no it does not, your play can lead to winning and yet you can still lose when the rest of your team is not good enough  a singular player does not make the worst team in the league a winning team even if his own play is contributing to wining.  Stephen Curry would still be an Allstar if he was on the Kings but they would be a losing team.  bad players don't put up allstar numbers on bad teams."
"Yeah, sure it does. To this team:   PG: Stephen Curry SG: Dwyane Wade SF: Larry Bird PF: Tim Duncan C: Wilt Chanberlain (Assume later-stage Wilt when he was more team oriented)  HC: Brad Stevens AC: Don Nelson DC: Ron Adams  Everyone on this team is at least above average when it comes to passing which works great with Brad Stevens’ style of play. They’re all offensively deadly, have range with Curry and Bird, an all-time great cutter in Wade, and monsters down low in Wilt and Duncan. If Wilt wants to go 1-1, Duncan get get out of the paint and be open for mid-range.  On defense everyone holds their own pretty well. Curry, while being the weakest of the five, plays good team defense to compensate for his lackluster on-ball defense. Wade is a three-time All-Defensive 2nd Team selection, Bird may be the single most underrated defender in NBA history (Probably the scrappiest too), Duncan is a nightmare to deal with down low, and we’ve all heard the stories about Wilt’s insane feats on defense (Most notably dislocating a players shoulder by blocking a dunk).   The coaching may be a bit wonky. I know Stevens is a very young coach, but I really love the way he runs his team.  I chose Nellie due to his success with the Bucks and Mavericks. Ron Adams is one of the unsung heroes of the GSW dominance. An amazing defensive mind that has had a hand in crafting the current dynasty we see today. No question Nellie and Adams, with Stevens at the helm, would get this team to do great things. "

No.  The one of best moves the Warriors made was trading Ellis and allowing Stephen Curry to do more.

"The Golden State Warriors call the play Cyclone because they stole it from the Iowa State Cyclones, who called it Cougar because they stole it from the BYU Cougars, who called it Dribble High because they stole it from Utah State. It was called Dribble at Utah State because that’s what it was called at Colorado State and Montana, and the guy who called it Dribble would know its name better than anyone.  “That was something I drew up a long, long time ago,” said Stew Morrill.  The clever play that Morrill doodled on a chalkboard in the Montana coach’s office more than 30 years ago soon began to spread, and it was such a good idea that it was adopted by rival coaches and local high schools wherever Morrill coached.  But how did something drawn up a long, long time ago eventually make its way to the Warriors? It took an unlikely series of seemingly unrelated heists for this one play to be perfected by one of the best teams in the history of basketball. And not even the people involved fully understood their pivotal roles in the chain that links Morrill to a potential NBA dynasty.  One summer day in 2015, Steve Kerr was having lunch with Fred Hoiberg. Kerr had recently coached Golden State to a championship, and Hoiberg had recently left his college job for the Chicago Bulls. They were chatting about basketball strategy when Hoiberg said he’d noticed that the Warriors used one of his plays. Kerr told him they actually named it Cyclone in honor of Iowa State.  That’s when Hoiberg confessed. It wasn’t his play. He’d taken it from BYU coach Dave Rose. And it wasn’t his play, either. “We’re all thieves in this business,” Hoiberg said.  But someone at some point had to come up with something original. As it turns out, when you trace the play back to its origins, that someone was Stew Morrill.  Morrill, who retired in 2015 after more than 600 wins at three schools, had a reputation among his peers for this sort of X’s and O’s wizardry. “I love Stew’s stuff,” Hoiberg said. Morrill was a widely respected tactician. There was nothing he enjoyed more than being in his office late at night eating pizza, drinking beer and diagraming plays.  “Sometimes it was really good, and sometimes it was really bad,” Morrill said. “Dribble was one of those that was really good.”  He came up with Dribble all the way back in 1986, his first season as a head coach, while tinkering with his trusty assistant Blaine Taylor. It had everything they wanted in a set play. It was quick. It was deceptive. And it was almost impossible to defend when executed properly.  Here’s how it works. The play begins with the misdirection of two guards whooshing past each other underneath the basket. One guard (Andre Iguodala below) continues to the wing and catches the first pass as the other guard (Stephen Curry) curls upward and sets a back-screen for a big man (Draymond Green). “There is no play if the guy doesn’t set a bone-crusher,” Morrill said. Then comes a pass from Iguodala to Green rolling off the Curry pick. If everything goes to plan—the cross, the first pass, the screen and the second precisely timed pass—the finish should be the easiest part.  Morrill’s teams ran this play so many times in so many games for so many layups that eventually they had to get creative with it. He disguised his calls using an elaborate system of cards—“we weren’t yelling Dribble,” he said—and took his precautionary measures to the extreme in league games against the opponents they played every year.  “We saved it for the second half when the offense was in front of our bench,” Morrill said, “so the other coaches couldn’t call it out.”  But even calling it out isn’t always enough. NBA coaches know that Cyclone is one of the Warriors’ favorite plays. In the fourth quarter of a tight game last year, Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy sniffed it out immediately and pointed out exactly what was about to happen: the Curry back-screen, the Klay Thompson pass, the Green dunk. It happened anyway.  There is a paradox at the heart of Morrill’s play: It turns a shooter into a screener. The play is devastating for the Warriors because Curry becomes a decoy. The only way to disrupt Cyclone is for the defenders to switch when they realize they’re in the eye of the storm. But the problem is that every basketball player on the planet’s instinct is to stick with Curry, and his gravity creates a brief opening for Green to sneak toward the basket after the back-screen for a shot even more valuable than a Curry three.  “If you have a good shooter setting that screen, you get layups,” Hoiberg said.  And if you have the greatest shooter ever?  “I’ll say this,” he said. “It’s really good when Steph Curry sets it.”  The Warriors aren’t known for running set plays. Their offense is a blur of cuts and constant motion as blissful to watch as it is brutal to stop. This one is so unusual, and so obviously successful, that it has become a source of curiosity itself.  The blog Golden State of Mind published an explainer about the play in November and said it was called Cyclone because of the way “players end up going in a whirling pattern.” That was both right and completely wrong. Kerr, who declined to comment for this article because he prefers not to discuss the details of his team’s plays, revealed on The Bill Simmons Podcast that it was called Cyclone simply because of he took it from Iowa State.  Hoiberg recently asked Bulls assistant Nate Loenser if he could remember any notable examples of the Cyclones running the play they called Cougar. Loenser barely had to think about it. The second half of their Big 12 Tournament game against Kansas in 2014, he said.  Kerr was in television at the time and happened to be assigned Iowa State’s broadcasts in the NCAA tournament less than a week later. It was clear to anyone who listened to his commentary that Kerr was ready to be a coach, and he’d been quietly building a library of cool plays that he liked. “There’s no patent on this stuff,” Taylor said. Every good idea in basketball is up for grabs. The culture of sharing among coaches means the smartest thing you can do if you like another team’s play is to plagiarize it.  Kerr was hired by Golden State not long after his Iowa State calls. The Warriors have been running the cool play he liked ever since.  Kerr wasn’t the only coach who admired Hoiberg’s play. Rose also found himself intrigued—but for another reason. The play looked awfully familiar to him. “I had no idea where he got it,” Rose said.  He got it from Rose. Hoiberg hadn’t bothered telling him that he was so envious of a certain play while scouting BYU before their games in 2012 and 2013 that he swindled it. Which was oddly appropriate. Rose hadn’t bothered telling Morrill that he inherited Dribble when he poached assistant coach Dave Rice from Utah State in 2005.  Rose liked Morrill’s play, Hoiberg liked Rose’s play and Kerr liked Hoiberg’s play enough to bring it to the highest level of basketball. It’s effective in the NBA because of the extra space, and it’s effective for the Warriors because of Curry, but it’s more or less the same Dribble that was getting layups for the Montana Grizzlies.  Morrill takes a deep satisfaction in the way his invention has endured. “There’s Dribble,” he tells his wife when they watch basketball on the couch. It’s more charming now than when he was still coaching and other teams used his own creation against him. Some of them even called it Aggie while playing the Utah State Aggies. There was a time when it was so popular that Morrill went out of his way to warn players: “Don’t get beat on our own play.”  Hoiberg can relate. The Warriors were playing the Bulls earlier this season when they decided it was time. They had to run Cyclone. As soon as the play was over—Golden State got a dunk out of it—Hoiberg looked down the sideline only to find Kerr already looking for him.  They both understood why the Warriors’ coach was cracking up."

It had everything they wanted in a set play. It was quick. It was deceptive. And it was almost impossible to defend when executed properly.  Here’s how it works. The play begins with the misdirection of two guards whooshing past each other underneath the basket. One guard (Andre Iguodala below) continues to the wing and catches the first pass as the other guard (Stephen Curry) curls upward and sets a back-screen for a big man (Draymond Green). “There is no play if the guy doesn’t set a bone-crusher,” Morrill said. Then comes a pass from Iguodala to Green rolling off the Curry pick. If everything goes to plan—the cross, the first pass, the screen and the second precisely timed pass—the finish should be the easiest part.  Morrill’s teams ran this play so many times in so many games for so many layups that eventually they had to get creative with it. He disguised his calls using an elaborate system of cards—“we weren’t yelling Dribble,” he said—and took his precautionary measures to the extreme in league games against the opponents they played every year.  “We saved it for the second half when the offense was in front of our bench,” Morrill said, “so the other coaches couldn’t call it out.”  But even calling it out isn’t always enough. NBA coaches know that Cyclone is one of the Warriors’ favorite plays. In the fourth quarter of a tight game last year, Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy sniffed it out immediately and pointed out exactly what was about to happen: the Curry back-screen, the Klay Thompson pass, the Green dunk. It happened anyway.  There is a paradox at the heart of Morrill’s play: It turns a shooter into a screener. The play is devastating for the Warriors because Curry becomes a decoy. The only way to disrupt Cyclone is for the defenders to switch when they realize they’re in the eye of the storm. But the problem is that every basketball player on the planet’s instinct is to stick with Curry, and his gravity creates a brief opening for Green to sneak toward the basket after the back-screen for a shot even more valuable than a Curry three.  “If you have a good shooter setting that screen, you get layups,” Hoiberg said.  And if you have the greatest shooter ever?  “I’ll say this,” he said. “It’s really good when Steph Curry sets it.”  The Warriors aren’t known for running set plays. Their offense is a blur of cuts and constant motion as blissful to watch as it is brutal to stop. This one is so unusual, and so obviously successful, that it has become a source of curiosity itself.  The blog Golden State of Mind published an explainer about the play in November and said it was called Cyclone because of the way “players end up going in a whirling pattern.” That was both right and completely wrong. Kerr, who declined to comment for this article because he prefers not to discuss the details of his team’s plays, revealed on The Bill Simmons Podcast that it was called Cyclone simply because of he took it from Iowa State.  Hoiberg recently asked Bulls assistant Nate Loenser if he could remember any notable examples of the Cyclones running the play they called Cougar. Loenser barely had to think about it. The second half of their Big 12 Tournament game against Kansas in 2014, he said.  Kerr was in television at the time and happened to be assigned Iowa State’s broadcasts in the NCAA tournament less than a week later. It was clear to anyone who listened to his commentary that Kerr was ready to be a coach, and he’d been quietly building a library of cool plays that he liked. “There’s no patent on this stuff,” Taylor said. Every good idea in basketball is up for grabs. The culture of sharing among coaches means the smartest thing you can do if you like another team’s play is to plagiarize it.  Kerr was hired by Golden State not long after his Iowa State calls. The Warriors have been running the cool play he liked ever since.  Kerr wasn’t the only coach who admired Hoiberg’s play. Rose also found himself intrigued—but for another reason. The play looked awfully familiar to him. “I had no idea where he got it,” Rose said.  He got it from Rose. Hoiberg hadn’t bothered telling him that he was so envious of a certain play while scouting BYU before their games in 2012 and 2013 that he swindled it. Which was oddly appropriate. Rose hadn’t bothered telling Morrill that he inherited Dribble when he poached assistant coach Dave Rice from Utah State in 2005.  Rose liked Morrill’s play, Hoiberg liked Rose’s play and Kerr liked Hoiberg’s play enough to bring it to the highest level of basketball. It’s effective in the NBA because of the extra space, and it’s effective for the Warriors because of Curry, but it’s more or less the same Dribble that was getting layups for the Montana Grizzlies.  Morrill takes a deep satisfaction in the way his invention has endured. “There’s Dribble,” he tells his wife when they watch basketball on the couch. It’s more charming now than when he was still coaching and other teams used his own creation against him. Some of them even called it Aggie while playing the Utah State Aggies. There was a time when it was so popular that Morrill went out of his way to warn players: “Don’t get beat on our own play.”  Hoiberg can relate. The Warriors were playing the Bulls earlier this season when they decided it was time. They had to run Cyclone. As soon as the play was over—Golden State got a dunk out of it—Hoiberg looked down the sideline only to find Kerr already looking for him.  They both understood why the Warriors’ coach was cracking up."
This has nothing to do with my original point that [individual] offense affects winning far greater than [individual] defense does. Individual is implied because the original argument was about Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. Whatever you’re on about has proved nothing. You’ve entire argument is proving that the team that scores more win. Might as well argue that water is wet.
What you're making is called a *false equivalency.* Mitchell is a good scorer but is nowhere near as talented or commands the same respect as Stephen curry. Even as a rookie curry was lethal from 3 and was a solid playmaker. A better comparison for mitchell is jordan clarkson.   &gt; game is about getting buckets  do you have any more cliches or buzzwords to throw at me or is that it? Do you want to talk basketball or just the shit you hear on ESPN?
"With the first pick, LeBron James takes Stephen Curry."
"So I didn't watch last night's game outside of a few highlights, but I think we need to talk seriously about the caliber of season Donovan Mitchell is having. Below is a table of all rookie seasons with TS% &gt; .55 (a reasonable proxy for league average), and MP &gt; 500, sorted by PPG. This dude is in some pretty rarefied air here: rookies, as a rule, *do not* score with this volume and efficiency. Sure, at 21, he's not the youngest rook. And yeah, as we're through only half a season, the shooting may dip under league average. But he's on an early track to be a perennial all star, and he passes the eye test with flying colors.   ||||||Crit|Crit|Crit|Tota|Tota|Tota|Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Shoo| |-:|:-|:-|-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|Season|Age|Tm|TS%|MP|PTS|G|GS|PTS|FG%|2P%|3P%|eFG%|FT%| |1|Walt Bellamy|1961-62|22|CHP|.554|3344|31.6|79||2495|.519|.519||.519|.644| |2|Oscar Robertson|1960-61|22|CIN|.555|3032|30.5|71||2165|.473|.473||.473|.822| |3|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|1969-70|22|MIL|.552|3534|28.8|82||2361|.518|.518||.518|.653| |4|Michael Jordan|1984-85|21|CHI|.592|3144|28.2|82|82|2313|.515|.526|.173|.518|.845| |5|Terry Dischinger|1962-63|22|CHZ|.578|2294|25.5|57||1452|.512|.512||.512|.770| |6|David Robinson|1989-90|24|SAS|.597|3002|24.3|82|81|1993|.531|.532|.000|.531|.732| |7|Walter Davis|1977-78|23|PHO|.577|2590|24.2|81||1959|.526|.526||.526|.830| |8|Terry Cummings|1982-83|21|SDC|.557|2531|23.7|70|69|1660|.523|.523|.000|.523|.709| |9|Shaquille ONeal|1992-93|20|ORL|.584|3071|23.4|81|81|1893|.562|.563|.000|.562|.592| |10|Bill Cartwright|1979-80|22|NYK|.608|3150|21.7|82||1781|.547|.547||.547|.797| |11|Kelly Tripucka|1981-82|22|DET|.570|3077|21.6|82|82|1772|.496|.501|.227|.498|.797| |12|Tim Duncan|1997-98|21|SAS|.577|3204|21.1|82|82|1731|.549|.553|.000|.549|.662| |13|Alonzo Mourning|1992-93|22|CHH|.586|2644|21.0|78|78|1639|.511|.513|.000|.511|.781| |14|Ralph Sampson|1983-84|23|HOU|.551|2693|21.0|82|82|1720|.523|.524|.250|.523|.661| |15|Hakeem Olajuwon|1984-85|22|HOU|.564|2914|20.6|82|82|1692|.538|.538||.538|.613| |16|Adrian Dantley|1976-77|20|BUF|.601|2816|20.3|77||1564|.520|.520||.520|.818| |17|Joel Embiid|2016-17|22|PHI|.584|786|20.2|31|31|627|.466|.495|.367|.508|.783| |18|Marques Johnson|1977-78|21|MIL|.563|2765|19.5|80||1557|.522|.522||.522|.736| |19|Donovan Mitchell|2017-18|21|UTA|.556|1321|19.3|42|34|810|.448|.518|.348|.519|.852| |20|Kyrie Irving|2011-12|19|CLE|.566|1558|18.5|51|51|944|.469|.491|.399|.517|.872| |21|Karl-Anthony Towns|2015-16|20|MIN|.590|2627|18.3|82|82|1503|.542|.559|.341|.555|.811| |22|Christian Laettner|1992-93|23|MIN|.564|2823|18.2|81|81|1472|.474|.489|.100|.476|.835| |23|Magic Johnson|1979-80|20|LAL|.602|2795|18.0|77||1387|.530|.540|.226|.534|.810| |24|Jerry Lucas|1963-64|23|CIN|.578|3273|17.7|79||1400|.527|.527||.527|.779| |25|Pau Gasol|2001-02|21|MEM|.566|3007|17.6|82|79|1441|.518|.519|.200|.518|.709| |26|Stephen Curry|2009-10|21|GSW|.568|2896|17.5|80|77|1399|.462|.474|.437|.535|.885| |27|Chris Webber|1993-94|20|GSW|.559|2438|17.5|76|76|1333|.552|.559|.000|.552|.532| |28|Tom Chambers|1981-82|22|SDC|.553|2682|17.2|81|58|1392|.525|.526|.000|.525|.620| |29|Kyle Kuzma|2017-18|22|LAL|.557|1341|16.5|43|20|711|.458|.514|.371|.531|.738| |30|Eric Gordon|2008-09|20|LAC|.593|2677|16.1|78|65|1252|.456|.496|.389|.529|.854|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=ts_pct&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=.55&amp;c2stat=mp&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=500&amp;order_by=pts_per_g&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats) Generated 1/18/2018."

The Pelicans are firing off all cylinders and are clicking at the right time. I can definitely see them upsetting the Warriors especially if Stephen Curry misses 2 games or so. I did not know Jrue was such a good player. He looks like a star player. 
"Look KD is a great scorer but compare him to his present day peers. It would make more sense. Great Players will adapt to the times as simple as that the stats you provided does indeed show my short sightedness of the whole issue.  However having said that I firmly believe in 2 things. 1. There was more physical defense compared to now.  2. It is unfair to bring a guy into the conversation when he has no way of competing now. 3. Please consider the eras they each played if you wish compare them then do so with the understanding of the different rules and the way the game was played in those days. 4. Refs were more lenient back then they would let extreme physical contact to be had, we are protecting our players more today that is the reason you see stephen curry being able to run to the basket if not he would be bodied a bit more does this make Stef a bad player not in the least he would have adapted to the game and still be an amazing scorer, but his efficency would have dropped a bit."

"James harden plays in the same conference as Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, etc"
So... Stephen Curry?
LeBron James! Stephen Curry! 
Stephen Curry has improved over the years. His defense had definitely improved from his injury plagued seasons
"&gt;1st. LeBron James- 99 first team, 1 second team vote (Sherrod Blakely- CSN New England), 0 third team, left off 0 ballots &gt; &gt;1st. Russell Westbrook- 99 first, 1 second team vote (Flavio Tranquillo- Sky Italia), 0 third team, left off 0 ballots &gt; &gt;2nd. Stephen Curry- Voting breakdown: 1 first team vote (Flavio Tranquillo- Sky Italia)-93-6, left off 9 ballots  I don't think it's ridiculous to put Curry on the 1st team over Russell (and I thought Russ was the MVP). Curry's just one of the three-best players in the world. If that's how you pick All-NBA, then that's fine with me.  Alternatively, having Durant and Kawhi on the first team over LeBron isn't that ridiculous if you view team success as more important than being the best player in the world. I disagree, but it's ok if you're consistent.  I'm also ok with someone saying Anthony Davis isn't a center since he splits his time pretty evenly.  The issue is that the criteria are left up to the media person. If the NBA defined these terms, you might end up with better results."
"alright at the risk of sounding pedantic and patronising I'm gonna try and explain. This should be understood by everyone.  1. rolling a fair die gives u 6 outcomes.... either 1,2,3,4,5, or 6... so clearly the chance of rolling any one of those is 1/6, or 16.7% chance.  2. Now you're referring to rolling either a 6 or not a 6, that's STILL not 50%.... because as stated above you have 16.7% chance of rolling each one. As a result you have 16.7% (1/6) chance of rolling a 6, and 83.3% (5/6)  of rolling ANYTHING else (1,2,3,4,5). If you doubt this go ahead and roll a die 100 times, 1000 times. you're unlikely to come anywhere near 50% for 6s.   3. Furthermore, I said a BIASED die... and any decent biased die means the probabilities are skewed even more towards one number.  4. As a summary, just because there are 2 possible outcomes does NOT mean they are equally likely to happen. Otherwise all players would be shooting 50% from layups, midrange, 3s, half courts, and full court heaves. And Javale McGee would be as good a shooter as Stephen Curry"

Stephen Curry opened up in an interview that [he often spaces out and daydreams about playing golf](https://www.pga.com/news/golf-buzz/nba-star-steph-curry-daydreams-about-golf-during-games) during timeouts
"DeMar ""Stephen 'Jamal Crawford' Curry"" DeRozan"
"&gt; For all the moves around the margins, it does not really matter if the balls don't bounce your way and your draft has Anthony Bennit instead of Ben Simmons.  This is true of every path to contention.  The Warriors got Stephen Curry on a ridiculous deal because of serious injury concerns, etc."

"Ah no. I'm not tryna hate. When everyone gave Iggy that FMVP, I was calling for Steph. When everyone ragged on Steph for disappearing two years ago, I said he was hurt. Dude made some critical mistakes in game 7 too. Which I'm sure got debunked, no? I'm just not putting Stephen Curry on that ""god tier"" that everyone is putting him on because having the team that he has opens things up for him like no other, while Dame doesn't have the same luxuries.  I'm just calling out what I saw this season. I live in the Bay Area, so I'm watching every game, and this idea that Steph is ""flat out"" better than Damian Lillard is embarrassing. I'll tell ya what. I'll own it after these playoffs. "

Forget comparing LeBron to other all time greats that have been to playoffs close to as many times as he has. Stephen Curry with a playoffs career that's a third of the length of LeBron's has seen more 50+ win teams in the Western Conference than LeBron has seen in the East. It's hard to deny the massive quality difference between the two conferences.
"Something to consider : true shooting career percentages... Kobe Bryant:55% James Harden 61%, Stephen Curry:62%. Michael Jordan 58% Kevin Durant:62%. Those are my top 5 scorers of all time. Obviously, kd, MJ and Kobe are better overall players than the other two and are more versatile scorers, but I still think when taking into account overall scoring ability and efficiency, Curry and Harden do deserve to be considered all time great scorers along with the other three. "
"&gt; Simple logic puts the Warriors far ahead of the Rockets.   I don't know about *far ahead*. The Warriors should definitely be the favorites over us if healthy, but Harden + CP3 are not that far below Steph + KD (who, to be clear, are the better pair).  Here's how I'd compare the players:  &gt;Curry &gt; CP3  &gt;Klay &lt;&lt; Harden  &gt;KD &gt;&gt; Ariza  &gt;Green &gt;&gt; Tucker  &gt;McGee &lt;&lt; Capela  ...  &gt;Cook &lt;&lt; Gordon   &gt;Young = Green  &gt;Igoudala &lt; Luc  &gt;West = Anderson  &gt;Pachulia = Nene  Warriors definitely have the edge, but the Rockets have got as much of a shot as anyone.  Oh, and because I know my rating of CP3 vs Curry will draw some flak, [here's some numbers.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id2_hint=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id2_select=Chris+Paul&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=paulch01&amp;idx=players)"
"Where did you see Rasheed playing off him constantly? I see a lot of pick and pops, poor rotations, and transition buckets. If Dirk hitting fadeaways and pull up jumpers is giving space, then I don't know what to tell you. Nobody is going to stay attached to the hip to players even if they're Stephen Curry. Everyone is a threat to drive when you play them that closely since all it takes is a single screen to throw away a defensive possession."
"&gt;Lol, how do you even buy that? You don't have to be in new york to rehab. That's not how physio works.   He's supposedly working with a specialist and his medical team at the NBAPA Manhattan facility, so yeah in this case he should be in NY.  &gt;Stephen Curry was rehabbing alongside his team for the past few weeks, and supported them in game 1. Do you think this is how a franchise/super-star calibre player is supposed to act?   Steph's rehabbing with the Warriors medical team and Kawhi isn't (since he had issues with them).  Steph also has a clear return timeframe.   Fuck being there for cheerleading when he's fucking rehabbing and focusing on his actual health.  &gt;The fact that he's kept his team in the dark and alienated a bunch of his teammates shows that this isn't just an injury. He's willingly quit on his team. He only gets the benefit of the doubt because you guys love that he's quiet.   He's told them multiple times that he's rehabbing in NY like Pop himself just said in the interview. His health is the biggest priority."

Pop has been more than sympathetic to his players' injuries, but his frustration with this situation shows you that its more. Meanwhile, you have dudes who are 40 years old (Manu, Parker) in possibly their last play-off series balling their asses off while Kawhi sits at home not telling anybody where he's at in terms of recovery. He quit. "

Oladipo does way more for the pacers than Klay for the wariors. You dont give the ball to Klay if you need a bucket with a minute left tie game. Klay wont be half as effective if hes not playing next to stephen curry or KD. Klay not gonna give you 37/7/10 and a win. 
"That’s the most absurd take i’ve seen, he is seriously is saying we can’t cheer for our team.LOL. We even could say that he is ridiculous for cheering for a team without Stephen Curry top 3 player in the league."
"Lol give me a f'n break. Stephen Curry is rehabbing and he's sitting in the arena with his teammates. Kawhi has been cleared by the Spurs doctors. Not only that, he refused to give a timetable for his return.   Stop giving this dude excuses. Any other star player would have gotten crushed if they acted as soft as this."
"I’ve been watching basketball since 2001 to answer your question.  An important stat to look at if you want to see a player’s overall impact on the game that takes into account both offense and defense is win shares.  Paul George entered the league in 2010-2011 season, later than any of the other players you mentioned (Russell Westbrook entered in the 2008-2009 season, and Stephen Curry and James Harden entered in the 2009-2010 season). If we compare the number of win shares for each player since PG entered the league, here are what the numbers look like.  Paul George: 53.4 total win shares  Russell Westbrook: 82.1 total win shares  Stephen Curry: 88.6 total win shares  James Harden: 102.2 total win shares  And if we compare their career stats for win shares per 48 minutes for their careers, here are what the numbers look like.  Paul George: .146  Russell Westbrook: .168  Stephen Curry: .208  James Harden: .220  However, you specifically mentioned PG’s impact in the playoffs, so perhaps we should examine whether he is elite amongst the other players you mentioned in that arena.  James Harden made his first playoff appearance in the 2009-2010 season, which also happened to be his rookie year. Russell Westbrook was his teammate that year and it was his first playoff appearance as well, but he was in his second season. Paul George made his first playoff appearance in his rookie season in 2010-2011. Curry’s first playoff appearance was in the 2012-2013 season during his 4th season in the NBA.  Paul George has had 7 playoff appearances since entering the league.  Russell Westbrook has had 8 playoff appearances since entering the league.  Stephen Curry has had 6 playoff appearances since entering the league.  James Harden has had 9 playoff appearances since entering the league.  Paul George has had 2 Conference Finals appearances and 0 Finals appearances.  Russell Westbrook has appeared in 4 Conference Finals, one NBA Finals, and has 0 championships  Stephen Curry has had 3 Conference Finals appearances, 3 Finals appearances, and won 2 championships.  James Harden has had 3 Conference Finals appearances, one Finals appearance, and 0 championships.  The career win shares per 48 minutes in the playoffs are as follows.  Paul George: .145  Russell Westbrook. .150  Stephen Curry: .199  James Harden: .168  Based on these numbers, in the regular season it is clear that PG is not in the same category as these other players you mentioned, and his playoff numbers are barely comparable.

"It could be good, but it could get ugly pretty quickly. If I had to choose one game today to introduce someone into the NBA, it's gonna be either Heat-Sixers or Pelicans-Blazers later tonight. I think those games will be better than this one and really fun to watch. But if you can only check this one, out, here's where you can start.   **Spurs star**: Lamarcus Aldridge. After a less-than-impressive season last year, he's bounced back, carrying this spurs team into the postseason, when many thought they wouldn't make it. With the absence of Spurs star Kawhi Leonard, it's his job to carry the load against this juggernaut of a Warriors team. However, the Warriors have been mediocre lately, as have the Spurs. Could the Spurs pick off a game?   **Warriors stars**: Kevin Durant - the reigning finals MVP formerly of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who joined the Warriors in the 2016 offseason after losing to them in a 7 game series that year. This was viewed as one of the weakest decisions in sports history, and really spoke to KD's lack of fortitude as a competitor. With Golden State star Stephen Curry to miss all of this series, it's up to him and a couple of co-stars who I'll get to in a bit to carry this team past the Spurs. Arguably the #2 player in the world right now, some consider him the best.  Klay Thompson - one of the best shooters in the league, who can catch fire at any time and possesses a shooting stroke unmatched in the NBA. He averaged just about 20PPG in the regular season, and he had a bit of a dissapointing playoffs last year, but he's looking to get more touches and get back on track with the team's leader Stephen Curry out.   Draymond Green - another of the Warriors' all-stars; he's having a bit of a down year but people are expecting him to ""flip the switch"" in this playoffs and go back to his usual self - a triple double machine who plays very good defense. Will he flip the switch? How will he play against a Spurs team that has historically been great at punishing little mistakes? Watch and find out!  But yeah, like I said I don't think this game will be that good. Golden state has the Spurs HEAVILY outmatched in talent."
"The Warriors are [7.5 to 8 point favorites.](http://www.espn.com/nba/lines/_/date)    According to rotoworld.com, Stephen Curry and Patrick McCaw are out for the Warriors.  Andre Iguodala will play.  Kawhi Leonard is out for the Spurs."

"No DeRozan is so tough to swallow. Yes, 70 games is basically a full season in today's game, but CP3 and Curry didn't come close to that 70 game mark. Yes, CP3 and Curry were superstar-level-great, and DeRozan wasn't. DeRozan's play didn't make you pick him, he would be the ""by default, because he played a lot"" candidate. Lowe has said in the past that, per [his minutes caveat from 2014:](http://grantland.com/features/nba-awards-season/)  &gt;Availability matters, to a point. Once a player misses 20 games, it becomes hard to choose that player over a roughly equivalent guy who played the whole season.  And DeRozan isn't a roughly equivalent candidate.   BUT:  In 2013, when picking Paul over Duncan for 3rd on the MVP ballot, Lowe wrote:   &gt;Duncan has been shockingly good, on both ends, serving as the hub of San Antonio’s side-to-side offense and the one rim protector standing between the Spurs and mediocrity on defense. But he’s barely cracked 2,000 minutes, a significant chunk fewer than Paul, and the equivalent of two dozen fewer games than the Harden/Westbrook/Bryant/Gasol crew. An “A-” player is worth more than an “A” player over the slog of the regular season if the “A-” guy is providing that many more minutes, even at a slightly lower level of overall play.  Paul and Curry have played ~900 and ~1100 fewer minutes than DeRozan, the rough equivalent of 25 and 31 games at 35 minutes per game.   Lowe is making the case that Paul and Curry aren't the ""A"" players he referred to above, but A+ players. Curry has a PER of 28, a TS of 67.5%, which is absolutely insane. Paul has more win shares than DeRozan despite playing so many fewer minutes, because his WS/48 is so much higher. His TS and PER and VORP are also much higher than DeRozan's.

""Availability matters to a point."" But man, that is tough to swallow.   The Raptors were the best team in the East all year. They finished as the second best team in the regular season. They deserve a guy here. If the NBA allowed the 15 best guys, DeRozan would've made it in over Simmons and Butler. "
&gt; Wardell Stephen Curry II   For some reason I thought it was funny that you put his full name. 
"&gt; You mean GSW bandwagon fans in comparison to Cavs, Lebron, and other team's fans (including other legit GSW fans) who gained respect for LeBron because of his greatness, right?  What? How come when other teams support GSW, they’re bandwagoners, but when they support the Cavs, they’re “respecting greatness”?   &gt; Yeah, you might outnumber us especially in this sub, but quality over quantity  Actually, I’d say Lebron probably has more overall fans than curry atm, especially when guys like Cowherd, Stephen A, Max, you know the big names of ESPN, control the narrative and push a very pro-Lebron one. Even on this sub, I’d still definitely say the number of people who think Lebron’s better than Curry is bigger than the number of people who see it the other way around"
"I think the title is a little misleading, though I would agree with your overall sentiment if what you think it is implying is what was actually implied.   It is saying that JR discussed Jordan vs Lebron, then discusses Stephen Curry (mainly him being the GOAT shooter), and then talks about Ben Simmons and his potential. It is not a direct comparison between MJ and the three guys."
"Stephen Curry shooting 3's when up by 30 is fucking stat-padding. If Russ getting a rebound *at any time during a game* is stat-padding, chucking 3's when up 30 is the same damn thing. "
"Find an example of Stephen curry stat padding? He doesn't give a fuck about his shooting stats, or his assists. He constantly hucks low percentage half court shots, and let's draymond get all the assists while he only gets hockey assists. "

"Buddy is one of 4 players to finish in the top 10 in 3P% and top 20 in 3PM this season. The other 3: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Joe Ingles."
"Stephen Curry is an all time great. People really hate on his playoff performance for no reason. He gets a lot of hate for his finals performances, but he's never averaged less than 22 ppg, or less than 58 TS% in the finals which is pretty amazing."

"Healthy Curry is probably the second-most impactful player after Lebron, lol.  Saying he is not a top option requires the memory of a goldfish.  His position would make even Bayless and Stephen A. Smith do a double-take."
BUT ARE YOU STEPHEN CURRY WITH A 40 INCH VERTICAL ?
"In MVP shares, James Harden is #30 all time, #6 of active players (behind LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Dirk Nowitzki, and Chris Paul).  Other fun MVP share facts: Jerry West (2.021) has the most MVP shares without an MVP award, and George McGinnis (0.509) has the fewest MVP shares with an MVP award. It looks best in fullscreen.  Update: [I made a graph](https://infogram.com/nba-stats-1hdw2jgmwo3d2l0) of MVP shares vs. MVP awards. "
"Agreed but the reason is the following season Harden's team was a huge disappointment and Harden showed the worst defensive effort of his career meanwhile Stephen Curry had arguably the greatest offensive season of all time and led the Warriors to the all time regular season wins record.   Rockets fans would've gotten laughed off Reddit if they claimed Harden deserved 2015 MVP, which is unfair because the MVP is a single season award. But people will carry the discussion into the following season and try to discount the MVP if he's not doing as well as the previous season, a la Russell Westbrook this year. "
"Well put. I have noticed that if i'm guarding sharpshooters however that it makes more sense to stay put on them; if i miss the rebound and their other team gets an offensive board they get a great open 3 often, so maybe Russ should adjust against players like say, Stephen Curry. But for the most part, I have no problem with their game plan to allow Russ to grab rebounds. Most of the times it boils down to a 1v1 on the fast break and when you have a player of Westbrook's caliber hes going to score those more often than not. "

Stephen Curry --&gt; Brian Scalabrine 
"If KD weren't on the Warriors, GS would be just an ordinary super team.   Consider this article: http://thesportsquotient.com/nba/2016/2/24/how-stephen-curry-dominates-the-paint. Notice that this article was published during the 2015-2016 season before KD joined the Warriors.  Also, this past season didn't Steph at the highest efficiency from midrange ever? It's pretty much universally accepted that KD benefits from Steph's gravity more than Steph benefits from KD's gravity, so if KD has a better midrange game than Curry surely he should be shooting at a higher efficiency? "
"Hakeem Olajuwon if you don't count MJ first retirenment.   Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Moses Malone Karl Malone, Charles Barkley maybe. Stephen Curry imo is better than KD, so this is my answer. "
"I conceded that he’s an all time great player, and that shot was nice. But this is the same guy who admitted he didn’t want to be the leader, basically admitted he wasn’t a competitor with his move, complained that they had “lost their engine” when Curry went down (even though he is good enough to be a teams engine). He also just got pushed off his block by Jrue Holiday and has a history of being guarded by point guards. He’s a legend but he hasn’t shown me that he has the heart of a champion yet  (Source for the doesn’t want to be a leader) https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2017/11/16/16667252/kevin-durant-face-warriors-steph-curry-gq-feature  (Source for engine comments) https://www.google.com/amp/s/warriorswire.usatoday.com/2018/03/11/kevin-durant-stephen-curry-is-the-system-here/amp/"
Stephen curry is basically that annoying kid who thinks he's gonna go pro for soccer but ends up coaching u12 teams in basketball star form 
Because the warriors have Stephen Curry and Kevin fucking Durant.
This is why so many kids favorite player is Stephen Curry.
Warriors starting point guards this series:  Nick Young: 2\-0  Wardell Stephen Curry: 0\-1
espn tomorrow:  #ARE THE WARRIORS BETTER WITHOUT STEPHEN CURRY?
Stephen Curry will still have a chance to break Reggie Miller's all-time 3-pointers made in postseason history if he hits 6 threes every playoff game this season and if Houston takes Golden State to 7. 
Stephen Curry
Lol Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry exist
It's really too bad tht on the ESPN promo where they show the two stars of each team and then close on the two stars facing each other it was Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis instead of Stephen Curry and Anthony Davis like it should be

"&gt; When the 6-foot-10 point guard was told the Rookie of the Year race appears to be a two-man show, he buried his head down and proceeded to chuckle. Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words. ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  "
"&gt;And in regular time he shot 2-13 from 3 in Game 5, those aren’t nice numbers dude  So wtf. You can't just select a portion of a game and judge by that. *Lebron only had 4 points in 1st quarter he was therefore trash last night*  You're just making bs excuses.

"I don't have all the answers out of my ass and I'm sure some of it is racism, but there are a lot of potential extra reasons.  A lot of black role models such as rappers, random celebrities, etc. are flaunting wealth through luxury clothes, shoes, expensive cars, jewelery, etc.   Bill Gates, Mark Fuckerberg, and honestly I'm having trouble of thinking of white cultural icons lol do not flaunt as much.  It creates a lot of psychological association with how you need x to be cool and then that will get reflected from your peers back to you and so on and so forth and creates a culture of financial irresponsibility.   Hopsin talks about some of this stuff often, ik he's hated by a lot of people, but you gotta treat him like a religion lol. Skim the surface and take out the useful stuff.  Which is why the NBA having Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and DeMar DeRozan will seriously help."
"For sure. Kevin Durant was the beneficiary of Stephen Curry's gravity, which provided Durant with tons of open looks and single coverage. To add onto that, Curry had an all time great playoffs himself, which really opened things up for Durant to have it easy."

"At the end of the day it's popularity and how that translates to shoes and merchandise sales. All those guys are on a different level than Kawhi and anyone else in Jordan brand. [Here are the numbers from this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/06/09/the-nbas-biggest-shoe-deals/#6e667b081520):  1. Michael Jordan: $110 million, Nike (Jordan)  2. LeBron James: $32 million, Nike  3. Kevin Durant: $25 million, Nike  4. Kobe Bryant: $16 million, Nike  5. James Harden: $14 million, Adidas  6. Stephen Curry: $12 million, Under Armour  7. Derrick Rose: $11 million, Adidas  8. Damian Lillard: $10 million, Adidas  9. Dwyane Wade: $8 million, Li-Ning  10. Kyrie Irving: $8 million, Nike  11. Paul George: $5.5 million, Nike  12. Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony: $5 million each, Nike (Jordan)  Some of these are outdated (like Westbrook who signed a big deal last summer) and are pretty old contracts so they may not be great comparison numbers but I would say he's somewhere in the Lillard to PG range as far as marketability goes. He's getting offered PG money essentially (4yr/$22m). I think he COULD get more but he'd likely have to get away from Nike."
"&gt; Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant receives in the neighborhood of more than $20 million annually from Nike as well, through a combination of the annual base salary of his shoe deal, sales royalties, and several incentive bonuses. Stephen Curry's Under Armour deal (more than $17 million annually), and James Harden's contract with Adidas (more than $15 million) make up the next tier of earners.  &gt; By comparison, Blake Griffin earns a similar annual figure from Jordan Brand to what Leonard was offered, while signature athletes such as Kyrie Irving, Paul George and Damian Lillard each earn more.   Performance on the court doesn’t necessarily equate to shoe sales and endorsement numbers. Kawhi needs to get out of his shell if he wants to compete with KD, Curry, Harden"
Nice list. This is mine off top of my head.  1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden 7. Giannis Antetokounmpo 8. Russell Westbrook  9.

"Oh it's the same thing I was just too lazy to type out their respective percentages. I don't mean to imply Curry is last or something he's definitely not that's why I left the link.  Anyways so yeah, Curry has a 14% career turnover % and Lebron and CP are at 13%. The difference is Lebron and CP handle the ball a ton and generate a ton of assists. Curry mostly plays off-ball and does not do a lot of direct playmaking and yet has a higher turnover % than these guys.  If you look at playoffs career among active players Curry gets near 15% and Lebron is still around 13% as is CP.   |Rank|Player|TOV%| |:-|:-|:-| |67.|Kendrick Perkins|24.25| |66.|Mario Chalmers|17.28| |65.|Dwight Howard|16.71| |64.|Rajon Rondo|16.37| |63.|Shaun Livingston|16.26| |62.|Draymond Green|16.23| |60.|Joakim Noah|15.68| |61.|Devin Harris|15.68| |59.|Tyson Chandler|15.67| |58.|Manu Ginobili|15.37| |57.|Kyle Lowry|15.09| |56.|James Harden|14.98| |55.|**Stephen Curry**|14.97| |54.|Paul George|14.63| |53.|Tony Allen|14.62| |52.|DeAndre Jordan|14.48| |51.|Richard Jefferson|14.20| |50.|Lance Stephenson|14.15| |49.|Dwyane Wade|13.94| |48.|Marcin Gortat|13.78| |47.|Russell Westbrook|13.75| |46.|Jeff Teague|13.67| |45.|Nene Hilario|13.66| |44.|Nick Collison|13.52| |43.|Andre Iguodala|13.36| |42.|Derrick Rose|13.22| |41.|Tony Parker|13.15| |40.|Josh Smith|13.08| |39.|**Chris Paul**|13.07| |38.|Udonis Haslem|12.92| |36.|Thabo Sefolosha|12.52| |37.|**LeBron James**|12.52| |35.|Paul Millsap|12.37| |34.|George Hill|12.10| |33.|David West|11.96| |32.|Al Horford|11.91| |31.|Tristan Thompson|11.86| |30.|Kevin Durant|11.80|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/tov_pct_active_p.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats_active_p_tov_pct) Generated 5/3/2018.

Just last night Curry had 6 turnovers and 2 assists. People think it's easy what Lebron and Chris Paul do that's it just a product of handling the ball a lot but it's not. It's a very special talent to generate so many assists with few turnovers. Curry handling the ball too much is not a good thing. His assists might go up but his turnovers would skyrocket too.  "

Sure in one game they may lose out but statistically over time it averages out to be favourable for the team to do it ie they win more than they lose in the long run doing it  Bit ironic you calling me out for not understanding the numbers when you have no idea whats happening here lol  Say 100 games are played out, 16 seconds left on clock, other team’s ball. **If they don’t foul**, their expected value lost from the possession is between 0.85-1.15 pts depending on the team ie **they get ouscored on average by 1 point**. However **if they foul a poor shooter** (which is entirely doable because it can be done entirely situationally - only if there’s an easy foul on a poor shooter), they lose out on average 1.5ppposs if a 75% FT shooter takes 2 FTA but on average gain between 0.85-1.15ppposs, so **their expected value lost is only 0.35-0.65points** compared to 1ppposs playing defence.  Even if they foul fucking stephen curry, the other team’s expected value gained is ~1.8ppposs (2 FTs at 90% of making) as long as they can score 0.85+ppposs it’s more favourable than playing defence (max 0.95ppposs lost as opposed to 1ppposs) but it gets a bit blurry here as it’s so close"

No that's Wardell Stephen Curry I from the 90s hornets
Stephen Curry his gravity is insane
"PG:  Stephen Curry ($1,100) SG:  Klay Thompson ($700) SF:  Kevin Durant ($1,100) PF:  Anthony Davis ($900) C:  Al Horford ($600) UTIL:  Chauncey Billups ($700) UTIL:  JJ Redick ($600) UTIL:  Ron Artest ($700)  When building this team, I was thinking of how great the Warriors are and how they have, most likely, the best NBA team ever assembled.   But how could it be improved?  Which player would fit their team and actually improve it without losing chemistry? The answer was Anthony Davis.  A supremely talented player that is cerebral and extremely active.   He would fit right in and dominate both defensively and offensively.   Adding AD to the Warriors would make them virtually unstoppable.  Once that ridiculous foursome was created, there was $2,600 remaining to fill C and three UTILs.  Al Horford is the C that would have the best chemistry for his value that I can imagine.  He is a great competitor on both ends of the floor, facilitates well and finishes efficiently around the rim.  Furthermore, his jumper demands respect enough to open up the paint for Durant and AD.  Chauncey Billups would back up Stephen Curry as the second ball handler.  He was also a true competitor.  A great floor leader that would ensure the team is playing at a high level.  He would be the calming presence; facilitating, scoring and defending.  Mr. Big Shot would be part of a balanced attack from the PG position.  JJ Redick would come off the bench for Klay Thompson.  This combination of SGs would be deadly.   They both are amazing pure shooters that would run off screens and provide excellent 3pt and FT shooting.  JJ Redick is an underrated passer as well and would keep the team’s offensive identity in tact.  Ron Artest would be the wing off the bench behind Kevin Durant.  Artest was an incredible defender who was both physical and had exceptional instincts.  His antics would be subdued on such a great team (see Ron Artest on Kobe’s championship Lakers).  He would often guard the best opposing player and I believe would play great with KD and AD, in particular.    ________________________  The recurring theme of this team would be the highest level of competitors.  There would be three of the greatest shooters of all-time In Steph, Klay and KD.  Anthony Davis would be a ridiculous PF with these players and would dominate without the ability to double team him.  I love the idea of KD and AD playing defense alongside each other.    Complementing these four are solid role players who would each bring their own contributions.  Big Al Horford is one of the most active and versatile big men who would fit right in.  Chauncey Billups would provide stability and reinforcement of the teams identity.  JJ Redick would continue the unbelievable shooting on this team and Ron Artest would provide lock down defense on the opposing offensive threat.  There is no true backup for Center, and Horford is a bit undersized.  However, much like the Warriors today, the team wouldn’t need a big Center as all other players are athletic and versatile defensively.  Plus, KD and AD at the 3 and 4, respectively, are each basically 7’ft tall.   At times, Anthony Davis could slide to the C position and Artest could come off the bench for Horford.  This would create their own version of a ‘Death Lineup’ with 5 versatile players that could switch defensively.    Another lineup would be having Billups at the PG with both Klay and Steph running off screens.  Complete it with KD and AD setting the screens and you have the most explosive offensive lineup imaginable.   "

Stephen Curry is gonna risk hurting GSW’s offense? What.   So we just supposed to keep him out the rest of the season?
As another bandwagoner from 2y ago.The reason is Stephen Curry. He is the reason I am willing to wake up 4:30am before school/work to watch games live. But I like other teams aswell now. I wouldn't mind if Jazz or Philly found a way to win it all this year.

"If Klay Thompson didn't go nuclear in the 2016 Western Conference Finals, Billy Donovan would probably be an NBA Champion. I think a lot of it for Donovan is just getting unlucky, first with Klay and then with Durant.  Now he's forced to coach Westbrook, who is going to play his style no matter what. If he had a different superstar (say Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Giannis, etc.) he would probably look better as he would actually get to coach. He's just got the dick hand of not being able to really coach Westbrook hard because the franchise is entirely tied to Westbrook now."

"Nah I disagree. He's definitely top-10, but his whole playoff run this year has highlighted his weaknesses which in my mind preclude him from being the best of the best.  Here are five players I'd put above him, not in any particular order:  Lebron James Stephen Curry Kevin Durant James Harden Anthony Davis  The super elite players in my mind are not only incredible individually and can create their own shots, but elevate their team's overall play and make their teammates better. He does only the former, and it's obvious that when he's out there it's to prioritize getting his above the welfare and success of the team. "
"Well, he’s not the most important player on the team. It’s not arguable, honestly.   He’s the best player on the team. He’s the greatest player on the team.   But, and make no mistake about it, Wardell Stephen Curry II is the most important player to the success of the Golden State Warriors.   Kevin Durant could’ve gone to any team, and he went to a team that didn’t need him to win a championship, and long-term definitely would’ve won another one. The only thing worse that he could’ve done was sign with the Cavaliers.   He could’ve went to any team in the East, but he didn’t because he feared Lebron. He could’ve signed with Portland, pretty sure Dame wouldn’t have minded sharing the rock with KD. He could’ve signed with LA. I’m sure the City of Angels would’ve loved cheering for KD. Could’ve taken his talents to Houston, reunited with Harden.   Like the other guy said, his legacy’s already fucked. He’ll definitely be in the conversation, but it’ll be a hard sell to say him. "
Or he knows Pelicans won't fall for it and will still plan for Stephen Curry to play. But actually they plan on resting him Game 1.  Reverse reverse psychology. 4D chess.
"Conveniently Curry and Harden were both drafted the same year.  Curry's discounted contract - [$44 mil / 4 years; $11 mil average](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/stephen-curry-6287/)  Harden's too expensive for OKC contract - [$78.8 mil / 5 years; $15.6 mil average](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/james-harden-6312/)  $4.6 million a year difference, which in terms of player value is less than what Shaun Livingston signed for the following year.  So while Harden was paid 40% more, in absolute dollars it's not a huge amount."
"I was just browsing the r/rehabtherapy subreddit and it just dawned on me that almost all NBA players are rehab peasants. Why? Why would millionaires put their knees through fake, upscaled 'braces' with 200 thread count, when they could instead build a sleeve that's capable of 800 thread count in TRUE microfiber, with 1/25 of their average weekly salary? Obviously Stephen Curry belongs to the masterace and maybe, just maybe, his excellent on-court mobility is due to how familiar his knees and legs are to the comparable fast paced game of basketball that only sleeves offer with their higher thread counts, better stretchability, and greater printed graphics. IDK.  Why are NBA players rehab peasants?"

"Steph is one of the single best offensive players of all time, he's miles ahead of Thomas by guy. He's the best shooter of all time by a very wide margin, nobody has been able to stop Steph for like 4 years...Thomas was a better passer but he's not a way better playmaker. Curry's impact on the floor is only rivaled by Shaq in terms of gravity and opening things up for others on the court.  [Curry in 15-16 had a PER of 31.5 on 67% TS. Even at Thomas' height he was only had a PER of 22.2 on a TS% of 54%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y1=2016&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Isiah+Thomas&amp;player_id2_select=Isiah+Thomas&amp;y2=1985&amp;player_id2=thomais01&amp;idx=players) Isiah was a better passer obviously, but the impact on the court offensively is so massively in favor of Curry idk how you could call him a ""way better"" playmaker. Steph stepping onto the court had an objectively larger impact than Isaih even in his best season (and that's not to mention how short Isiah's peak was, the rest of his career outside like 2-3 years Zeke was a 19/8 guy). In terms of offense the gap is grand Canyon size my friend. Zeke was one of the best defenders of his time without a doubt, he's a better defender than Curry will ever be. But the flip side is that Curry is just too far ahead of Isiah in terms of offense"

Draymond Green is a creation of Stephen Curry/Steve Kerr. Put him on the Kings/Hawks and that team still plays like crap.  He is not a better player than Trevor Ariza by any means.
"I think Steph and Klay are BY FAR the best 2 3-point shooters in the history of the game. I actually caught quite a few of the early years of Ray Allen and Reggie Miller and they don't compare in my opinion. Those two were top tier for their time but were never as automatic as Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.  On a side-note I also think Korver is the best spot-up 3 point shooter of all time, better than Ray Allen.  So in other words, YES, we live in the 3-point era and it's obvious that that fosters the best shooters of all time."

"Stephen Curry, the first two time MVP role player "
Wardell Stephen Curry II  
Stephen Curry is the most valuable player on that team.
So MJ was the Stephen Curry of his generation? 
"He did not fucking play center. You’re making shit up. I watched all the finals games last year and he NEVER played center. Scoring they are close, but LeBron trumps him everywhere else, absolutely demolishes him. If you bring up defense then that’s because KD can rest more due to having 2 of the greatest shooters ever and a beast DPOY player who can cover up his fuckups. LeBron’s best defensive players on the Cavs are George Hill and Tristan Thompson, his second option is Love, who while is a very good player, is miles away from Stephen Curry and equal with Klay Thompson, who is Golden State’s THIRD option."
"Since this thread is terrible, what would you say the chances KD has slept with Ayesha?  Personally I could see it going like this:  Steph stays late after an intense playoff game with their teams trainer making sure that his fragile legs are well taken care of so he can recover. As he sinks into the ice bath, beautiful toes fresh out of the sock with a new coat of blue and yellow paint flash into his mind.  Curry has a painfully shrimpy erection in the ice as he imagines JVG whispering ""Bang, Bang, Bang! Curry's done it again!"" into his ear with a nibble.  After an intense orgasm he realizes he must go home to rest up for the next game and drives to his house. Opening the door, he hears an all too familiar sound and walks into his house with fear building inside of his gut.  Their bedroom door is wide open as he sees the Durantula hanging from the ceiling with two hands so he can kneel on the bed while Ayesha, who has on Westbrook's ""0"" jersey, slams back into his frail body.  ""Yeah, told you that you can't buss with that cat."" KD says under his breath as he continues to plow his running mate's wife.  ""Ohh Kyrie!"" Images of the legendary shot that ended the 2016 NBA finals, and her respect for Stephen Curry flash through her head as she begins to feel an orgasm brewing.  Curry sees this and realizes that he is in luck. KD goes limp right as Ayesha begins to scream ""Ohh yeah, right there! Don't Stop KD.""  With Steph watching from the doorway, KD begins to nervously shake and falls backwards off of the bed and ceiling.  ""I'm sorry Ayesha, I just had flashbacks of 2012 when I didn't have a 73-9 win team behind me. Let me make a call."" With this, KD goes to leave and notices Curry shimmying in the doorway.  The two lock eyes for a moment before they realize what must be done.  Each man proceeds to the living room, where they facetime Draymond Green in order to gangbang Ayesha....  Epilouge: The team's chemistry built heavily this day, with Curry, Durant, and Draymond all becoming one fluid body. Where one ends, the other continues, and to this day you can still see the glimmer in KD's eye when he sees Steph wag his tongue on the court, or when he sees Draymond scream with passion after a rough defensive possesion."

What team do you coach then 😂  I think you have to take the clutch time stats into account in situations like these. Steph is historically a guy who plays well in clutch situations. A quick link I grabbed on mobile talks about this: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2620720-nobody-compares-to-stephen-curry-in-the-clutch-at-any-position  Superstars can play poorly for a majority of the game but still tend to come through in late-game situations. Steph exemplifies this. Poll Houston fans to see how many of their assholes clenched on the last shot of game 4 - how's that for data?
imagine having Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry on your team and not running the pick and pop with them 
No. Stephen Curry is the best PG.
"Wonder what he was thinking doing this to Stephen ""Make-A-Wish-Kid"" Curry"
"As a Warriors fan I'm severely disappointed by Stephen Curry. He's a two time MVP, has a 200M dollar contract, considered arguably the greatest 3 point shooter of all time. He shouldn't be looking to get open for his shot. He should be forcing it. Take your man and shoot it on him. That was the softest play by an MVP I've ever seen. Chuck up shots if you have to. Chris Paul showed so much damn heart, forcing anything he could. And instead Stephen Curry is letting Draymond and KD run the offense. Take the ball, and shoot the 3. I don't know if it's terrible coaching or just Steph is THAT bad in the playoffs but I'm so disappointed as a Warriors fan. The Rockets deserve this series. They actually want it. I don't know who this Warriors team is. No heart at all."

"Text below in case you are having problems with the WSJ paywall, though my link should have cheated that.  _________  Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, doesn’t own a car.  He realized several years ago there was a smarter way for him to move from one place to another than the way he’d always done it. And that’s when he decided to sell his Lexus SUV. He stopped driving. He started taking Uber everywhere.  It might sound almost unfathomably odd for someone who runs a professional sports team in a city known for sprawl to get rid of his car because he’d rather commute by climbing into a stranger’s car, but only if that someone were anyone other than Daryl Morey. He applied the same empirical rigor to the question of how he should get to work as he did the question of how the Rockets could improve their chances of winning the NBA title. Morey calculated that it would be cheaper, a better use of his time and safer for everyone involved if he were in the back seat.  That was all the rationale he needed to go carless. He’s so pleased with his decision almost three years later that he says he’ll never have a car in Houston again.  “There’s a whole bunch of ways I can ruin my life right now,” Morey said. “One of them could be that I do something stupid driving and hurt myself or hurt someone else. So why even have that risk?”  The way he thought about his method of transportation happens to be a surprisingly useful way of understanding how the Rockets are now tied with the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. Morey looked at the same facts as everyone else before this season—that any NBA team with Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant was probably going to win the championship—and then he thought differently than anyone else.  The Rockets weren’t content to wait out the Warriors. They went after them instead. Morey understood that he had to be aggressive, extreme and contrarian to beat a team that may turn out to be unbeatable.  Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey understood that he had to be aggressive, extreme and contrarian to beat the Warriors. Photo: Bill Baptist/NBAE/Getty Images  They were willing to try anything. They defied conventional wisdom when they traded for Chris Paul even though they already had James Harden. They had the audacity to shoot more 3-pointers than 2-pointers. They overhauled their defense by signing complementary role players who could be especially useful in a series against the Warriors. They were coached by Mike D’Antoni, whose name has become synonymous with playing fast, and they played slow. They isolated more than any team in the NBA, and because they had Harden, they averaged more points on their isolation possessions than any team in the NBA.  But all that zigging when the rest of the league zagged only gave the Rockets slightly better odds against the Warriors. They were a really good team, possibly a great team, with the burden of playing one of the greatest teams in the history of basketball. The Rockets were unabashed about their obsession with the Warriors because they had to be.  They needed to chase every little edge they could get. They also needed to get lucky. And then maybe—maybe—they would have a shot to beat Golden State.  That’s what they have now: a shot.  The Rockets saved their season in Game 4 by winning exactly the kind of game they were built to win. Morey’s grand plan might actually work. The series is 2-2 heading into Game 5 on Thursday night, and it has become clear the Rockets are the only team capable of seriously pushing the Warriors this season. They are the last defense against the Golden State dynasty. And they’re in this position in no small part because they were constructed by the type of person who thinks it’s reasonable to live in Houston without a car.  Morey says his approach to driving was like his approach to investing and, for that matter, building an NBA roster. He tried to strike the right balance of risk and return.  Morey treated the rules of the road as mere suggestions. He was not a fan of red lights, and he found red lights for left-hand turns so objectionable that he sometimes ignored them.  “I skirt the speed-safety line,” he said. “I go really, really fast, but I’m super safe. I haven’t had an accident since I was 20.”  “You haven’t had an accident in three years,” said his wife, Ellen, who still owns a car, “because you haven’t driven.”  The streets of Houston are safer now that he’s no longer behind the wheel. He types away on his BlackBerry—yes, his BlackBerry—and works on the way to work. He can be productive even when he’s in the car. And he never has to worry about parking.  Morey understands that it might be necessary for his family to own a car. He doesn’t necessarily endorse it. “It’s...fine,” he said.  But not everyone understands his logic for not having a car. Morey recently explained to a colleague that he was trying to optimize his life around only things that were important to him. That person asked: “Are you Buddhist?”  The other explanation for why he Ubers everywhere is that Morey actually likes meeting the people who drive him around Houston. He talks to anyone who talks to him. When one driver told him that he was a musician, Morey indulged him and listened to his songs. “They were pretty good, I thought,” he said. The driver then told him that he personally delivers his CDs and even claimed to have made one delivery to New Zealand. “I sorta, maybe believed him,” Morey said, “although I don’t know why.”  He’s been in so many Ubers by now that he’s developed opinions about routing algorithms. He thinks about beating Houston traffic the same way he thinks about beating the Warriors. It may not be possible, but all he can do is bend the odds in his favor. He prefers that his drivers use Waze. Except if he’s really in a hurry. In which case he checks Waze and Google Maps to compare his options.  “I’ll let them vote on the route,” Morey said. “And then I’ll use my own judgment.”"

"As I said, it is a totality of his play all year. He lead the league in steals and played great defense all year. The point being is that I think the guy who leads the league in steals should at least be on people's radar.   As for Steph lead the league a couple years ago. Since 2007, here are the league leaders in steals:  * 07-08: Chris Paul * 08-09: Chris Paul * 09-10: Rajon Rondo * 10-11: Chris Paul * 11-12: Chris Paul * 12-13: Chris Paul * 13-14: Chris Paul * 14-15: Kawhi Leonard * 15-16: Stephen Curry * 16-17: Draymond Green * 17-18: Victor Oladipo  So you have Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kawhi Leonard, Steph, and Draymond Green. I think most people would agree that Steph is outlier on that list and that the others list are pretty good defensively. Not saying that steals on its own is a great stat for defensive play (because it isn't) but it certainly can be used with everything else to show if a player is effective defensively. "

"One thing that caught my attention was Stephen Curry picking up his dribble in the post, a forward blocked his path, and instead of passing the ball he tried to go up with it anyway.    It seemed like he was spinning to try and trick the bigger guy and I don’t know if anyone was open, but it still seemed like an arrogant and stupid move to make, for him to try and go up for a shot with a big man right up against you   "
"Yeah, that is true.  But his playmaking became better within the better offense under Kerr as he entered his prime, he just had more playmakers around him.

Curry is just so much better at creating his own shot.    And Westbrook gets more assists, but that is mostly a product of how ball dominant he is.  [Westbrook](http://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*russell) passes on a lower percentage his drives than [Curry](http://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*stephen) does, but still scores on a much smaller percentage of his drives.  Westbrook does get assists on more of his drives, but he also gets TOs on more of his drives.  Curry can playmake for himself and others.  Westbrook's ferocity can create easy looks for others, but he doesn't create efficient looks for himself like Curry does.  And it is easy to construct an elite offense around Curry's brand of playmaking, while Westbrook's brand of playmaking makes building an offense difficult, since any offense that counts on Westbrook as lead playmaker will be heavily iso based."

Kerr and Mike Brown are great guys ad good coaches. Everyone else on the Warriors from Joe Lacob to Stephen Curry can get annoying; the way they’re all pompous asses.
So you mean to tell me Stephen Curry is coming off as extremely arrogant? Noooo.
"The first episode, himself, that’s fine. After the second episode about DeMar, his Raptors lost the series. After the third episode about Donovan, his Jazz lost the series. After the forth episode about Jrue Holiday, his pelicans lost the series. After the fifth episode about LeBron, the Cavs went down 0-2. After the sixth episode about Jayson Tatum, the Celtics lost 30 points. After the latest episode about Stephen Curry and the warriors, they lost their first home playoff game since 2016’s finals."
Stephen Curry went 1/9 from the field in the 4th quarter. He’s had one good game this series. One.   He’s the “most important player” on the Warriors yet Curry stans defend him from any flak whatsoever when he fails for his team.
"Personally I could see it going like this:  Steph stays after an intense playoff game with their teams trainer making sure that his fragile legs are well taken care of so he can recover. As he sinks into the ice bath, beautiful toes fresh out of the sock with a new coat of blue and yellow paint flash into his mind.  Curry has a painfully shrimpy erection in the ice as he imagines JVG whispering ""Bang, Bang, Bang! Curry's done it again!"" into his ear with a nibble.  After an intense orgasm he realizes he must go home to rest up for the next game and drives to his house. Opening the door, he hears an all too familiar sound and walks into his house with fear building inside of his gut.  Their bedroom door is wide open as he sees the Durantula hanging from the ceiling with two hands so he can kneel on the bed while Ayesha, who has on Westbrook's ""0"" jersey, slams back into his frail body.  ""Yeah, told you that you can't buss with that cat."" KD says under his breath as he continues to plow his running mate's wife.  ""Ohh Kyrie!"" Images of the legendary shot that ended the 2016 NBA finals, and her respect for Stephen Curry flash through her head as she begins to feel an orgasm brewing.  Curry sees this and realizes that he is in luck. KD goes limp right as Ayesha begins to scream ""Ohh yeah, right there! Don't Stop KD.""  With Steph watching from the doorway, KD begins to nervously shake and falls backwards off of the bed and ceiling.  ""I'm sorry Ayesha, I just had flashbacks of 2012 when I didn't have a 73\-9 win team behind me. Let me make a call."" With this, KD goes to leave and notices Curry shimmying in the doorway.  The two lock eyes for a moment before they realize what must be done.  Each man proceeds to the living room, where they facetime Draymond Green in order to gangbang Ayesha....  Epilouge: The team's chemistry built heavily this day, with Curry, Durant, and Draymond all becoming one fluid body. Where one ends, the other continues, and to this day you can still see the glimmer in KD's eye when he sees Steph wag his tongue on the court, or when he sees Draymond scream with passion after a rough defensive possesion."
"If Kevin Durant slept with Ayesha Curry, what would the ramifications be?  I see this going one of two ways. Let's work through both scenarios.  First, Steph comes home from a long trip to the local Foot Locker. He's greeted to the sight of an elongated, legless, carnivorous reptile plowing his wife in the pastry maker. That's when he realizes, just as the prophecies foretold, Stephen Curry is a cuckold prince. He grabs his pacifier, curls up into a ball, and weeps. At that moment, Lebron James enters the Curry household, and then begins to spoon his son to sleep. The rest of the NBA is none the wiser.  In the second scenario, Stooph does not come home that night. When he next sees Ayesha, she tells him everything. Steph arrives at practice early the next day. When he enters the locker room, its just him and the servant.  ""You been suckin' them toes, boy?"" Stooph says.  The servant approaches. They kiss cheeks.  KD enters Bob Myers office.  He shouts, ""Myuhhh wife!"" while dressed as a crude recreation of Sacha Baron Cohen's character Borat, from the surprise 2006 blockbuster, Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.  Robert knows what he must do. He gets on the phone, and within moments, Otto Porter, Tomas Satoranksy, and a 2018 WAS 1st round pick are headed to the Bay. The return was less than satisfactory, for Kevin had announced (via his 7 Twitter accounts) that he was retiring at the end of the 2017-18 season, so that he could return to his roots, either on ground of some sort of forest or jungle, or inside of a glass box in a invariably edgy 14 year old boys room.  Ron Wallsley and Bradley Bealtrix Lestrange arrive at the airport to pick up their newest teammate/pet Kevin Durantbledore. They touch wands and restore peace within the fractured NBA.  Stooph and Ayesha stay together in this timeline."
"James Harden yelled, “There you go!” Eric Gordon gave a look of pleasant surprise. Chris Paul belted, “Bite me.” And before Stephen Curry hit the locker room door, ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him &amp; said, “I can’t win with these cats.”"
Warriors obviously a contender.  PG - Stephen Curry/Tim Hardaway  SG - Klay Thompson/Mitch Richmond  SF - Rick Barry/Chris Mullin  PF - Chris Webber/Draymond Green  C - Wilt Chamberlain/Robert Parish
"If they theoretically blew it up but didn't actually blow it up that'd be a sweet deal for them.   ""The Warriors have traded a theoretical Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry to the Suns for ten 1st round picks."""
Idk man sometimes it seems like Stephen curry goes out on the court thinking they already won the game. All this talk of them being unbeatable is starting to get in their heads a bit it seems to me. I mean Steph hit a 3 with 1 minute left in the 3rd to put them up by 8 and he started doing the salsa or some shit like he hit a game winner or something. He doesn’t take the game as serious as he use to and it’s starting to show.

It'll take James 20 playoff games to pass Ray Allen.  edit: unless one of them has a historic end to the playoffs Allen's record is safe for one more year
"**ATTEMPTED TO FORMAT**  Greetings, my name is Tyler. In the 2018 NBA draft there are a lot of interesting prospects with many different skill sets and accomplishments. Luka Doncic is exhibiting himself as the best European prospect in history winning the EuroLeague championship, Euroleague MVP and the Final Four MVP. Mohammed Bamba posting the longest wingspan in the history of the NBA combine. Combined with being second in the NCAA Division in Blocks Per Game and very solid mobility, he has the potential to be a dominant force in the NBA level. Uber athletic double-double machines Marvin Bagley and DeAndre Ayton cannot be overlooked, and both have athleticism that is rare in players 6'11 and taller. There is mystery surrounding Michael Porter Jr with his back injury and how much that will affect him. An absolute dominant force in the high school level, he lead his team in high school to a perfect 29-0 record resulting in them winning the Washington Class 3A State Championship. Porter Jr averaged a monster 36.2 points and 13.6 rebounds per game. He was the number 1 player in the 2017 ESPN 100 class before Marvin Bagley III reclassified. Jaren Jackson Jr showed amazing potential in his limited minutes and touches at Michigan State. He established himself as a dominant shot blocker at the college level that looks very translatable to the NBA. He averaged 3 blocks in only 21.8 minutes of play, and his per 36 minute block rate is an absurd 4.95 blocks. Combine that with a very solid 39% 3 point percentage in college, he has the tools to be a great two-way front court player. Even with all the amazing potential of all the players in this draft, my favorite prospect in this draft is Trae Young and I am going to explain why this is.  **PASSING** :  Trae Young has displayed masterful passing skills at Oklahoma combined with excellent court vision. A subpar Oklahoma team that went 11-20 the year before Trae Young joined. With no other creators on the team, Trae Young was under a lot of pressure to create for other teammates, set them up and put them in the best positions to succeed while creating for himself. Trae Young averaged 8.7 assists to lead the nation in assist, and at certain points of the season his assists were higher than 9 per game. However, his turnover rate of 5.2 per game jumps out and can cause concern. Turnovers are something that Trae has to work on at the next level. But if we compared to other guards in this draft his turnover rate is not as alarming as it seems. Using the site https://www.sports-reference.com I compared Trae Young's assist to turnover ratio to other top PG's. Collin Sexton averages 3.6 assist to 2.8 turnovers per a game which indicates that he has an assist to turnover ratio of 1.286 compared to Trae Young's ratio of 1.673. Even John Wall, an NBA point guard known notoriously for his passing skills posted a slightly lower assist to turnover ratio of 1.625 with far superior talent surrounding him. Also, Wall had more scoring threats on his team. DeMarcus Cousins, Eric Bledsoe, and Patrick Patterson were all part of the 2009-2010 Kentucky Wildcats team. All of which are NBA players currently better than anybody on the Sooners basketball team that Trae Young played on. His teammates would be lucky to make the G-League.  **SCORING** :  Trae Young is like Stephen Curry in today's NBA, and in college is far more of a shooter than at driving the basketball close to the bucket. Trae Young averaged 27.4 PPG and 8.7 APG, and was the only person in NCAA history to lead the nation in points and assist per game. He had arguably the greatest season for a freshman point guard in NCAA history and one of the greatest individual seasons in NCAA history. He shot a true shooting percentage of 59.3% which is a very big feat when you look at how often he was double teamed. He was double teamed 43.7% of his touches past half court, and the next highest player was Stephen Curry at 31.4% of his touches. This puts Trae Young up with some of the biggest scoring threats in NCAA history which is an amazing feat considering he was just a couple of months removed from high school with what we consider subpar teammates in the PAC 12 with many of Trae Young shot's coming off the dribble. In comparison Collin Sexton shot a true shooting percentage of 57.6% and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shot a true shooting percentage of 58.6% with lower usage rates and being double teamed less. One very underrated part of Trae Young's game is his ability to get to the free throw line. He averaged 8.56 Free Throw attempts a game shooting a very high 86.1%, meaning he makes 7.4 free throws a game. He has very underrated quickness and good ball handling skills, and he is able to get into the lane and the paint at an effective rate. At Young's disposal, he has a deceptive hesitation dribble than can keep his defenders on their toes. One big thing for Trae to work on is that he needs to finish at the rim at a higher percentage. He also shot very few midrange attempts in college. The NBA is moving away from midrange shots but at certain points that could be problematic. For his age, he does have a very impressive floater that he can hit from all corners of the basketball court.  **SHOOTING** : Trae Young is known as a knock down shooter, winning the McDonald’s all American 2017 3-point contest. He established himself as a top level shooter in ESPN's 100 class. He has the ability to knock down shots the moment he crosses half-court, which is the main reason he was double teamed at such a high rate in college. He finished the season shooting .360 percent from 3 making 3.7 out of 10.3 attempts per game. He was shooting in the low 40% at the beginning of the year but as defenses started to really double team him and the degree of difficulty of 3 pointers attempt started to lower his percentages. Overall, he is a very underrated catch and shoot player, and on his 58 catch and shoot 3 pointers in college he averaged an absurd 1.4 points per possession which is about 46% on catch and shoot shots. On the dribble 3 pointers  he was in the low 30% range. His three point percentage would be much better overall if he had teammates that could run or create an offense which would allow Trae Young to have more catch and shoot opportunities. Players with really good free throw percentage's tend to overall turn out to be very good shooters in the NBA. Consistent free throw shooting usually indicate better and more consistent form, and he shot 86.1% from the line. I believe Trae Young will be able to benefit a lot form the increased spacing that is in the NBA. If he is double teamed in the NBA there are players with the talent level to make the opposing team pay for double teaming Trae. This would help Trae in catch and shoot scoring and overall efficiency. One major reason Trae Young's shot will be effective in the NBA is that he has a very quick one shot motion like Steph Curry which make his shot much harder to guard and contest, unlike someone like Jimmer Freddette who has a much slower two shot motion which does not go well for unathletic players at the NBA level.  In conclusion, I think a way Trae Young is becoming underrated in this draft. Even though he is undersized at 6'1.7 in shoes and has a 6'3 wingspan at 176 lbs, Stephen Curry measured 6'3.5 with a 6'3 wingspan and weighed 183 lbs at the combine. He has a very good handle, is excellent off the dribble, has great shooting skills, and has good off ball movement in the College level. The most important part is Trae having a very fast release. He also has good passing traits which I think are just as important as his shooting at the next level. Even though comparing him to Stephen Curry is very bold, what he has displayed makes me feel it is very hard not to compare the two. Trae was just about as good as Curry in his junior year at Davidson as a freshman. He is even showing better passing skills than Stephen Curry in college. Trae certainly has his flaws but he has an offensive skill set that many players will never have no matter how hard they try. In the NBA with more about spacing than ever, I believe Trae Young can shoot with the best of them. I also believe many people may miss out on Trae Young taking a positional need instead of someone that has the potential to be a once in  a generation shooter, and people will say 'why did we miss out on this again?'"

Compare Steph to everyone else on the list. Lebron has made 19 more 3's than him and has **played in 150 more playoff games**. And this isn't taking into account shooting percentages.

Kareem Abdul-Jabaar  Wilt and Russell could have arguments for top 10, but I feel it’s appropriate to leave the old guys out because it’s completely incomparable their league to more modern times.   I think Duncan and Shaq’s legacies are being undersold. Duncan is probably the best defensive player of all time, and he gets underrated because we undervalue defense, as well as because he was smart enough to defer on offense and play within a system. I think he’s what a modern day Bill Russell career looks like.   Shaq was unstoppable. I think a lot of his legacy is strong dismissed because of Kobe Stans wanting to promote Kobe up, but Shaq was a fucking beast in the early 2000s. Best way to describe him is like the center version of unanimous MVP Curry.   The things Curry and Durant are doing together is also pretty insane (Curry best TS% for a volume scoring season ever this year), so they’re coming in hot towards the top of the leaderboard, but a lot will depend on how the rest of this playoffs and the next few years go for them.

"Man, I remember the talk right when they were choosing to extend him. Things like that:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1391383-stephen-curry-contract-extension-is-risky-business-for-golden-state-warriors  ""When you consider that Curry's draft-class contemporary Ty Lawson got four years and $48 million from the Nuggets, it might feel like the Warriors got their man at a slight discount. But really, Lawson hasn't had anything close to the injury history Curry has. He was a risk-free investment with a pretty high ceiling. Curry’s potential may be greater than Lawson’s, but he’s a substantially riskier investment.  In giving Curry $11 million a year, the Warriors are obviously betting that his repeated ankle issues are a thing of the past. That's really hard to swallow, especially when his most recent ankle incident occurred about a week ago.""  Still, Curry gave it up easily, really, it's not like he couldn't play harder and get more money, but he loves the team. He could play hard and he would have gotten the max. If not GSW, then somewhere else sure. But probably GSW."

People thought Rubio was the next guy because he looked like he could be on the court against the 2008 Redeem Team and he played against ""grown men"" in the Euroleague.   He's not a bad player, but the idea that Minnesota took him over Stephen Curry is still crazy to me, especially after what Curry did in college."
WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!
And star player Stephen Curry won't go cold forever too. Just like this game.
And star player Stephen Curry won't go cold forever too. Just like this game.
"I love Stephen Curry, he's the best player on that team. If he doesn't perform, they lose. But when he does: He wrecks any team. "
"Here's the story: http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16268827/stephen-curry-says-father-law-threatened-arrest-nba-security-cites-mistaken-identity  Security had been told to look out for a guy who had gotten into a bunch of games without paying. When Ayesha's father came in, they thought it was the scammer, and threatened to arrest him. Ayesha tweeted that ""Police racial profiled my father and told him to remove credentials and tried to arrest him."", so it sounds like he had a credential and they told him to remove it because they thought it was fake, too. Getting them threatening to arrest you just because you looked like someone they wanted to arrest seems like a pretty clear-cut case, tbh."
"well that’s because they drafted each of their all stars (except KD) and created a system which allows each star player’s talents to be maximized, which all happen to compliment curry’s transcendent shooting ability. this team is a once in a generation occurrence - if that at all. so how can you be so salty and criticize curry as if he’s getting carried by his teammates like the guy i replied to suggests.   —  this team wasn’t formed via some lebron to miami type shit, the warriors fucking earned this and people should be more appreciative that they get to witness such a free-flowing dominant team rather than act like a kid and have hot takes that rival stephen a smith"
And this is why Stephen Curry deserved FMVP.
Stephen Curry really slimmed down in the past decade

"Well there is positioning data available to actual teams and maybe online if you're willing to pay for it.    There are available stats that can show the impact of his gravity though. My favorite is teammate TS% when on/off the floor.  In their The Case for Stephen Curry MVP article last year 538 had a good illustration of this.  Steph and Lebron were by far the top 2, and I think Steph was slightly better than Lebron.    This was from last and isn't perfect at isolating ""gravity"" but I think it is a useful thing to look at.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/"
"&gt;**David West**: ""Dude’s one of the greatest on the planet. Y’all ain’t giving him enough credit. He doing more for the game than Wilt Chamberlain did, but y’all steadily riding that man. This man changed the whole way the game is played. The whole way the game is played. He’s done with the 3-point shot what Wilt did with the dunk. C’mon, man. Give the man his love. The man is a game-changer. He’s revolutionized the game. Nothing you can do to take that shit away. But he’s humble man. Steph is not a selfish guy. He’s not a selfish individual.

That means more to me than anything.""   &gt;**Andre Iguodala**: ""People always ask what do you enjoy most about this? It’s got nothing to do with the rings. You get a true human being like that who really represents something that’s larger than the worldly things we see every day, you appreciate those type of things. He’ll never be appreciated for that but I see it every day. Time with him, I really cherish that. Just being around him. Like golf. I’m always like ‘I can’t wait to golf with Steph.’ He’s just a humble dude.""   &gt;**Mike Brown**: ""I’m telling you, it's real.

Of course they've been trying to extend the series to 6 or 7. Too bad Warriors are just too great lol. I'm glad they still won and Stephen curry now has 3 rings despite all the abuse he's endured this post season.
"Stephen Curry is probably one of the most unselfish, team-oriented players in the league. If people think he's anything more than a little disappointed that he didn't win it they're delusional."
"You're the type of person who needs drawings to understand...   Let me try ely5    You see, Lebron James developed into an All Star, but then he JOINED two All Stars on team called Miami Heat that play in Miami and are called Heat.   This happened in 2010-11 season, which is year that it happened.   Now you see on the other hand we have Stephen Curry who was drafted into a team called Warriors from Golden State, the city.   Some of his other team mates who are also All Stars were also drafted into that same team, where, imagine, they DEVELOPED together into All Stars.   Some might say, they grew up together, they are not ""mercenaries"".    Now whats the difference ?   Difference(means not same) is, Lebron, Wade and Bosh were not developed in one team together.      "
"People like to say that so and so ""changed the game"" in this sport or that sport. But I've been watching for a couple of decades now, and the only player that I've ever seen actually change a sport is Stephen Curry."

Not sure. I do remember they came back from a historic 3-1 lead and he actually adopted unanimous MVP Stephen Curry as his child on live TV
"idk I became a fan of this team and started watching basketball in the 2012-13 playoffs because of their identity and how they were the underdogs, and mainly Stephen Curry. This team just has a different vibe with KD. I only enjoyed the games with no KD this year..  I'm thinking of just removing my flair I've lost interested in this group as a whole, only really a fan of certain players nowadays."
Isn't that    Stephen curry Stephen curryy he is making me crazzy  Song guy lol
"KD got the better statistics, but the most valuable player is Stephen Curry."
"He didn’t say anything about opening up the floor, he said he wasn’t the best player, and he’s right. KD is better than Stephen Curry."
"In my opinion, kevin durant is the most overrated superstar in the nba right now. He took the easy way out and now he's winning championships and mvp's of the back of Stephen Curry and company.   Before Golden State warriors, he couldn't do what he's doing now. GSW didn't need him but KD sure as hell needs that team. I guarantee that if he hadn't make this anti competitive move, he wouldn't have won a single championship in his career. "
"When Inside the NBA turns into just the Warriors 4.  Ernie: Lebron James Jr. has now won his 3rd championship in 4 years, but has yet to win finals MVP. LiAngelo Ball won it in 2027 for his defense on Lebron, and then Zaire has won it the past two years. What advice do you have for him Steph?  Stephen Curry: Well the most important thing is getting the team win. That's what this sports all about. Lebron Jr. played great, he's now beaten Lebron 3 of the last 4 years, and has really been unselfish in setting up his teammates. I don't know what more you can ask for him, he's been excellent in all these finals.  Kevin Durant: Finals MVP's Erneh.  Klay: Uncontrollable chuckling.  Draymond: Shutup, you snake. You had to join 73 win team to win a championship.  Kevin: Finals MVP's Draymond. I've got 6, you have 0.  Draymond: You know what, I'm going to kick your ass.  "
"""Should a player hold Stephen Curry or his arms, before he touches the ball when he is cutting to the rim, it should not be called a foul. It should only be called a foul if he already has the ball and shoots a floater or some other type of soft layup. Maybe only 50% of the time it should be called in that case."""
Stephen Curry is the easiest superstar to play with in NBA history and that's what allows the Warriors to have the success that they do. 
Yes it was well know the cap was going to spike because of the new TV deal. [There’s this article from November 2015 discussing how feasible it was](http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-warriors-free-agency-thunder-wizards-stephen-curry-golden-state/1t6dmolxwdo8a1aldv684guf3c)

"Stephen ""26-5-6 is not great"" Curry. Dre got it for a narrative, he held Lebron to abysmal shooting % and had solid attacking series. "
"It's kind of interesting to see who chooses to talk up the other Cavaliers, like anyone can tell you the talent isn't up to par to the elite teams in the NBA. They seem like a mish\-mash of guys who make it work because of LeBron.  Stephen Curry a couple of games ago and Kobe, it's weird to me."

"Jesus Christ. I have not seen this level of flat out worship of a celebrity in my life.  Let me put this straight for you. Noone's said ANYTHING about Steph having a superstar teammate, because he already had 3! Dray puts in that hustle, and great defense. Ever heard of ""the splash brothers""?, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson? The greatest pair of sharpshooting guards we may EVER see. Andre Igoudala, a great component, the Cavs almost took game 1 in his absence.  Sure, Steph and KD can run an offense through them, but if it were just KD and Steph, and then some garbage like LBJ dragged to the Finals, then we would see that those two alone can't do everything.  Quit whining on Reddit when you are getting 3 rings in 4 years and most likely a lot of them soon to come. Kids like you is what's bringing the reputation of the Warriors down. Be happy with what you have, because we may see a record breaking amount of rings, so shut up and be happy."

The players are picked *mostly* based on the total Win Share (WS) for that team. For a player to become an icon for the team, I think he should (1) win games and (2) played many seasons. Total Win Share [(an advanced metrics assigning wins to players according to their contribution)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win_Shares) covers both parameters.  Please note that my focus is on **CITY**. In other words, if a team was relocated, e.g. Cincinnati Royals &gt; Sacramento Kings, only players who has played for the current city will be eligible. In this case, legend Oscar Robertson, despite have 3x WS over Peja Stojakovic, cannot make the list. I make these adjustments because it feels wrong to, say, put Gary Payton as the icon of OKC.  Another adjustment is made for up-and-coming players who are 95% likely to become the most WS player (e.g. Stephen Curry 93.3 vs Wilt Chamberlain 112.4)  The above two adjustments and a few more subjective deviations are discussed below:  - Atlanta: **Bob Pettit** is 1st but played for St. Louis. Dominique is 2nd. - Brooklyn: **Buck Williams**, Jason Kidd, Julis Erving and Richard Jefferson have better WS, but played for New Jersey/New York. Brook is 5th. - Charlotte: Kemba Walker (41.2) is now 3rd, but will likely pass Muggsy Bogues (44.8) and **Gerald Wallace** (45.9) next year. - Golden State: Stephen Curry (93.3) is now 3rd, but will likely pass Paul Arizin (108.8) and **Wilt Chamberlain** (112.4) in 2-3 years.  - LA Clippers: DeAndre Jordan (76.3) will likely pass Chris Paul (78.2) next year, but Chris Paul was the leader during their golden era, so I picked him. - Milwaukee: **Kareem Abdul-Jabbar** (114.7) is way ahead of Sidney Moncrief (88.5). However, I believe everyone remember Jabbar as a Laker (and his WS with Lakers is 158.7!). I don't think it is appropriate to put him as the icon for the Bucks, so I pick Sidney Moncrief instead. FYI Antetokounmpo (38.9) still need 5+ winning years to catch Moncrief. - New Orleans: Anthony Davis (62.5) is now 2nd, but will likely pass Chris Paul (76.4) in 1-2 years. - Oklahoma City: **Gary Payton** is 1st (123.8) but played for Seattle. **Kevin Durant** is 2nd (107.9). Westbrook is 3rd (90.1) and will likely pass Durant in 2 years. - Philapelphia: **Dolph Schayes** is 1st but played for Syracuse (except final year). Dr.J is 2nd and much more iconic. (Iverson is only 6th, behind Barkley, Hal Greer and Maurice Cheeks.) - Phoenix: I *subjectively* picked Nash, who is 3rd for Phoenix (82.7), over **Shawn Marion** (1st at 93.2) and **Kevin Johnson** (2nd at 90.9). I think Nash &gt; Marion because Nash was the leader of that team. I pick Nash over KJ just because *I* think Nash is more iconic. (Barkley is 11th) - Sacramento: Oscar Robertson (154.2) and Jack Twyman (75) played for Cincinnati. Bobby Wanzer played for Rochester. Peja Stojakovic is 4th (59.8). (Mitch Richmond is 8th and Chris Webber is 11th) - Toronto: Chris Bosh is 1st (61.8). **Kyle Lowry** (56.3) and **DeMar DeRozan** (54.0) are close behind. I'm not sure if Toronto will keep both during this offseason, so I stay with Bosh for now. If both Lowry and DeRozan plays one more year (and if I ever made an updated version) I would make an exception and use a photo of Lowry and DeRozan hugging each other. **Vince Carter** would have been more iconic, but he's 4th (47.7).  ^(BTW I just randomly pick photos from Google. Hope I didn't violate any copyrights..)  "
[Damn had to looked it up to see if that was true](http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2013/04/30/denver-nuggets-dirty-play-hit-men-stephen-curry/8770/) 
i’m sure you know more about mental preparation for a finals game than Stephen Curry 
"See, people say the Warriors were already stacked once they got Durant. Prior to that? Stephen Curry is overrated. Klay Thompson couldn't carry the offensive load as a #1 option on another team. Draymond Green's stats are only good because he has two great 3 point shooters.  All of a sudden, KD signs and everyone is screaming that they were already stacked.  Stop it."
Stephen wants that 50 feet of Curry (Ayesha) though.
"Stephen ""Jeremy ""Wardell"" Lin"" Curry"
"This game reminded me of the game in high school where the opponent would double Steph Curry without the ball every time he crossed half court. The Cavs completely sold out on the paint and mismatches just to dedicate themselves to stop Curry. Every switch given away for free, doubles leaving the paint for wide open dunks,  everything dedicated to STOP STEPHEN CURRY.   Super impactful game from him but his box score looks terrible. He defended extremely hard, rebounded, had a lot of insane passes, but couldnt get in a rhythm offensively because they just absolutely smothered him."
"Thing is, Celtics started this bullshit in 2008 as in that the term super team got popular. Lebron simply joined a team that would give them competition.  No one is innocent. Fuck super teams in general. They ruin the league and make it unwatchable during the post season.   KD gets reasonable disdain because he joins a super team that defeated him. Not only that, they also won 73 fucking games.  What makes it worse? Warriors do not try as hard. They were 64 wins last year and are less than 60 wins this year in the regular season. KD ruined the Warriors named; a franchise known to tackle hardships and be a powerful under dog during odds. Such as the 2007 We Believe team and what they pulled of in 2015 when Stephen Curry was finally being recognized as an elite player.  KD dismissed all of that because the team he is on now fuels in so much hate to the Warriors. It is justified and bitch and blow KD all you want. His snake move was even worse than the 85 Celtics, 2008 Celtics, and the Lebron to Heat injustice."
"23 out of the possible 56 teams have had 4 HOFs or more.    Teams with 4 HOFs or more facing teams with 3 or less are 10-4 in that time.    4 times have both contending teams have had at least 4 HOFs. These numbers aren’t included in the second stat.   I would argue that parity and dynasties don’t go hand in hand. And although there have only been a couple dynasties according to the win/loss column, so many of these teams in this list have been as dominant at their time, if not more, than the Warriors are now. And they all added a piece to get to their peak.   Here is a list of every finals since 1980 that I put together.

"Last night on SC, Stephen A Smith (who I hardly ever take seriously) made a great point. He stated that it was the coaching that essentially lost the game for the Cavs last night, because of the fact that KD wasn’t being double teamed in the second half. Klay was cold, Curry was cold, and it never occurred to Lue to double team KD so he could give the ball up. JVG brought it up towards the end of the second half as well. Seems that everyone thought that, except Lue. "
[Stephen Curry Game 3 Lowlights](https://imgur.com/T0hoVjA)
"Nothing wrong with gay love, hence why I said homophobic garbage, because being homophobic, in this day and age especially, to me is garbage. I get the pun but when you go around talking shit on Curry like this guy it's obvious he made the name in bad taste rather than some sort of cute joke.  The FMVP race is probably still closer than some would assume after tonight, and for what it's worth I think Steph might still be the favorite because I have a feeling that whoever decides FMVP probably understands the situation and would cut Curry some slack when it comes to his performance in game 3.  If they're gonna take into account everything in terms of what Steph has done for this team in terms of being their leader this playoffs and rising to the challenge when Durant has struggled he'll probably win it. But you're right, I absolutely do think it comes down to game 4.   I think a good performance by one and a bad performance by the other seals it for the man who performs well (should the Warriors win in game 4). If they both perform well then I think it's a toss-up. If you judge it based solely on the Finals, Durant has played better on average and probably deserves it. When you take into account the entire playoffs and the role each player has taken, I think you give it to Stephen Curry. "
Stephen Curry.
"Kevin ""Stephen Curry"" Durant"
you can't sit here and say stephen curry does not and did not desire to win a finals mvp in his career. 
"It doesn't matter. If you're the best player in the NBA, you try.  Lebron TAKES A STEP BACKWARD to get ""screened"" by Stephen Curry.   Whatever you want to say, who would you rather guard KD in the last possession? Lebron or Rodney Hood?"
I mean why wouldn't he want to play with his oldest son Stephen Curry James 
"Perfectly balanced. As it should be.     -Stephen ""Thanos"" Curry"
Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry will be in the running.
Nobody will remember Stephen Curry? How many LeBron posters you got.
"Stephen Curry forces the Cavs to switch everything, so it's impossible for them to not give KD the ideal matchup every single possession."
Yeah cause LeBron asking for a pick to switch on little Stephen Curry is so much better right? 
Yeah because you just leave stephen fucking curry alone after 3 bad quarters. Jesus christ
Dude how about the pass to Stephen Curry lmao Durant doesn't pass my ass
JR smith or stephen curry? who is the fmvp
Don’t let the Warriors leading by 1 make you forget JR Smith has more points than both Klay Thompson  and Stephen Curry tonight 
iS sTEpHen CuRry iNJurEd ¿
I can't imagine a Warriors team that could only rely on Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson
Kevin Durant knows how to play against adversity. Stephen Curry does not.
A bigger Stephen Curry
"Stephen Curry flopped and hooked the arm, get out of here. "
There isn't any other way to play defense on LeBron if you're Stephen Curry. LeBron is overly physical so I think that's a charge.
"what if Steve Kerr goes all ""awaken, my son"" on Stephen Curry and the dude drops 40 in the third lol"
What??? Wardell Stephen Curry is the GREATEST shooter to ever grace the game of basketball and yet taking away his movie 3’s wound not make him an allstar?? Nephew...
&gt; History has shown drafting based on talent has a higher success rate than drafting for need at the top of the draft.  Everyone always brings up the MJ example over 30 years ago but people seem to have a hard time coming up with examples of teams that passed on a clearly better player for need and it not working out besides that one. Lets say you have the top pick in the 2012 draft and lets pretend your top 5 best players are all pf/c's. I agree you should absolutely still draft Anthony Davis. But these situations aren't the ones people are arguing against. Its the one where you are Suns and your best 3 players are all wing players and you have Doncic who has arguments of why he should be drafted number 1 but also plays as a wing player but also have Ayton who also has arguments of why he would be better.   Lets say Ben Simmons and Anthony Davis were both in this draft. Lets say you already had KAT and Embiid on your team then draft Ben Simmons. Lets say you already had Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving then go draft Davis.

"Yeah, if you're going to ignore the facts and act like you know what a guy's intentions are while you're watching him play basketball from hundreds of miles away then there's no point.  You're blinded by the narrative.  EDIT: You can ""prove"" anything you want by taking single plays out of the context of a full game.  Russell Westbrook is the greatest defender on Earth, here's five good defensive plays he has made.  Stephen Curry is a selfish chucker, look at these bad shots he took when he had other options.  It's nonsense."
"You literally just said ""Reddit thinks he's underrated"" and now are saying ""my take of Kobe isn't underrated"" is ""parroting off reddits majority opinion"". What are we even doing here   ""The Kobe is inefficient"" is just talking to a straw man nobody said that.  I bring up the PPG and that 35 he averaged in 06 regarding how many on here now insist ""he was robbed of mvp in 06!! 35 ppg how can he not win over Nash!!"". When no in reality Nash and his &lt;20 ppg had a fine case: both guys did(I would have slightly leaned Kobe) but this idea Kobe stans can't grasp that someone averaging 19 PPG can make comparable impact to s guy averaging 35  So I'll tell you what I am saying   1) Kobes ""clutchness"" is totally overblown. 38% FG for his career in the standard definition of playoff crunch time settings. 51% TS. Many players are better than that from LeBron to Dirk fo CP3 to Steph Curry to Tony Parker to DWade amongst others. But his clutchness is always amongst the first thing people mention with Kobe because we just remember the makes and people liked his style   2) His defense was overrated it wasn't just at the end of his career. The link above has good stuff about how he actually got blown by on a poss basis way more than a top defender would wasn't air tight in his help D often didn't just take the best opposing player contrary to belief etc. The advanced metrics particularly after like 2004 never painted him as any kind of top defender either despite his reputation persisting   3) He has no case vs Duncan. Duncan on the totality overall has a clearly greater impact factoring both sides of the court. His peak was also better. In 03 Duncan had a supporting cast of   Young Tony Parker who averaged as many shots as points that postseason whom Popovich sometimes took out from key moments because he didn't trust him nor at the time poor defense   Rookie Manu putting up 9/4/3 off the bench   David Robinson near the end of the road averaging 8/8   Stephen Jackson playing the role of chucker putting up 13 a game on 41/33/80 shooting splits and who wasn't always focused defensively   He won a title with this. Kobe fans repeatedly try to tell me how Kobe has no help in 06/07(true) while also then claiming Duncan did in 03 while not realizing there wasn't a massive difference in the quality of their two supporting casts."

"Here are my personal thoughts on the questions  -The Bucks would be a legitimate title contender. Giannis would still be the best scorer/player on our team.  -I think that Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, or DeMar DeRozan would lead the league in scoring  -The Pistons would be a team that would be very positively impacted by this change in my opinion  -The Warriors would be a team that would be negatively impacted by this change, they'd still be very good with 4 all-stars but I'm not sure they'd be the favorite anymore without a legitimate big and less value from deep shots  -I think the best team would change. I could see a team like Utah becoming the best team in the league because Rudy Gobert would become even more valuable as a rim protector  -Ben Simmons would be even more valuable because long range shots would have less value  -Stephen Curry would be less valuable. He'd still be a star due to his gravity and other abilities, but he'd no longer be a generally consensus top 3 player in the world  -Greg Monroe, Lonzo Ball, Enes Kanter, and Jonas Valanciunas would have their values shoot through the roof"
"Your daily reminder - Derrick Favors is 26 right now (will hit 27 next month). He is younger than John Wall, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry (just examples). "
"Iguodala didn’t make LeBron have an absurdly inefficient series though, LeBron had a historically awful supporting cast in that series, so LeBron had to have a Westbrook-level usage rate and shoot 35+ times a game, of course he was going to be inefficient. Nobody who has a &gt; 40% usage rate is going to be efficient.   There’s nothing wrong with valuing defense, but you are *severely* underestimating the impact Stephen Curry had and always has had on their offense. Without Curry over multiple seasons, the Warriors have a below average offensive efficiency per 100 possessions. You try to sell them as being this “team”, but their team with the other 3 All-Stars played a long stretch without Curry this year and was abjectly terrible on offense.   Defense is super important, but Curry isn’t just a normal great offensive player, he’s a generational one because of the way he bends the defense because of his shooting ability, the reason the team gets all the assists and easy shots is because teams have to trap Curry 30 feet from the rim, which they don’t have to do with any other player in the league. And if you don’t trap, and leave your players on an island 1v1, you get what happened in G2 when Curry broke the Finals record for most 3s.   Curry is still under appreciated by many people like you because his impact on the team isn’t always noticeable, even his bad statistical games, the team is always much better on offense when he’s in the game vs. not (irrelevant whether KD is on/off), because defenders are always scared shirtless of him.  TL;DR you REALLY REALLY underestimate Curry’s gravity and his overall impact on the Warriors offense. They don’t win any of their rings without Steph. There’s a reason why KD himself says Steph is the franchise player. Because Curry’s game is about 3s, which the 3-pointer is an extremely variable shot, he is more likely going to have a stinker of a game in a series and that prevents him from winning FMVP in the mind of most voters.

I have been to the states and have watched 4 NBA Games in total:  1st Game - 12/14/2004 - Indiana Pacers Vs Boston Celtics. I had an amazing experience for my first NBA game. i was watching Jermaine O´neal and Stephen Jackson practicing and when Stephen went to the tunnel we spoke for about 5 minutes and he was so nice to me. He played in the Dominican Republic for a brief time and he averaged 40+ points per game over here. The celtics won that game and Fred Jones did an amazing dunk that night on Raef Lafrentz.  2nd Game - 05/12/2011 - Chicago Bulls vs Atlanta Hawks. Game 6 of the Eastern conference Semi Finals. Josh Smith had a Crazy Alley oop, Boozer destroyed Horford and i saw MVP D-Rose. it was a Blowout but i saw 2 great teams for the first time. Fun Fact: that same day i was walking in downtown Atlanta and saw David Aldridge crossing the street, we shook hands and we spoke for a brief moment.  3rd Game - 11/25/2015 - New York Knicks vs Orlando Magic. 2 really bad teams, but i was happy to see Carmelo and Porzingis. Porzingis block on Oladipo was amazing and the Magic won that game from the start.  4th Game - 01/15/2018 - Golden State Warriors vs Cleveland Cavaliers. We drove 5+ hours in a snow storm just to see this game from rochester NYC to Cleveland, i was so hyped for this game. I saw many Hall of Famers in D-wade, Lebron, Curry, Durant, etc. Lebron had a great game but they GSW has way to much firepower. My favorite NBA player is Kevin Durant and he had a monster dunk on Lebron James, i almost left the building when i saw this. Curry even dunked on that game. it was an amazing experience that i cannot describe with words. This is one of the best memories of my life.   All of this were gifts from my family that live in the united states, and i am really thankful to all of them for this amazing gifts. i have so many memories i can share just because of this."

"This is from a pasta that was posted in /r/warriors and it's a bit twisted from what was reported but aren't completely wrong. The Demon thing is really the only one without much basis. Here's the back up I have found for each:  ___  Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with the press because he thought they were gunning for his job.  **Partial Confirmation**. What has been reported is the following:  &gt; This, in the end, had been part of Jackson’s undoing. Upon joining Golden State, he’d instituted a rule forbidding assistant coaches from talking to the press. Even so, assistant Mike Malone received credit for the team’s improved defense, which angered Jackson (who declined to comment for this story).  &gt;Lacob: “And if you’re going to get better, you’ve got to have really good assistants. You’ve got to have people that can be there to replace you. We all know this from all of our companies. It’s . . . Management 101.

Could not find anything in particular that says this but they had a beef. Malone left for a headcoaching job however:  &gt; Even so, assistant Mike Malone received credit for the team’s improved defense, which angered Jackson (who declined to comment for this story)  &gt; For two straight years, Jackson has had issues with assistant coaches that he hired. Michael Malone and Jackson would go weeks without speaking to each other a year ago, league sources said. Malone left Golden State to become the head coach of the Sacramento Kings.  ___  Instilled a ""us vs them"" mentality where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad.  **Confirmed**. Based on Scalabrine interview over his firing:   &gt; He s the leader, so we had this meeting of clearing the air, and the meeting was, it was like a bombardment of he s trying to like get everyone to say that I m a bad guy, and I m a bad coach, and I should be off the staff. I m not sure what the point of it is, but just imagine an emotional loss after the Spurs, and he goes to every coach and says, Should Scalabrine be here? Is he a bad guy? Is he disrespectful? Or whatever he said. And what is an (assistant) coach going to do? You re like some low-level coach, and Mark is your boss, and is Scalabrine disrespectful? Of course you re going to say yes. So every person was like yeah. So then he brought in management and did the same thing. So we have a meeting where it s me versus coaches and management.

That is in accordance with the initial report, as it was not indicated that West was absent from all of the team's sessions or activities. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation.  [Source](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/mark-jackson-refutes-wanting-to-ban-jerry-west-from-practice/)  ___    Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli breaking down crying in front of the team and saying that he didn't do this and Mark Jackson was lying.  **Confirmed**. Though Ezeli and Mark Jackson denied on Twitter.  &gt; When Festus Ezeli was injured last season, Jackson and his staff told the healthy players that Ezeli was cheering against them — so that he would look good, according to several team sources. Players confronted Ezeli in a meeting, and he wept at the accusation — which he denied.  [Source](https://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-champs-are-here-a-guide-to-the-elite-and-unlikely-cast-of-characters-who-defined-the-2014-15-golden-state-warriors/)  ___  Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy stuff like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired.  **Unconfirmed**. The reasons stated for the recording do not correlate to the reports. Sources reported that it was because Jackson was talking shit about Erman. Erman handled this professionally and the reasons for the recordings were never leaked however he quickly joined the Celtics after this and is now top assistant for the Pels now so his rehiring among other organizations makes it seem like a plausible reason, especially with the other weird stuff happening.  &gt; The Warriors in the last six weeks demoted one assistant and fired another, and ESPN.com’s Chris Broussard today reported that the team fired Darren Erman after learning Erman had recorded at least one coaches’ meeting. Multiple league sources confirmed the gist of Broussard’s report, and that Erman was concerned Mark Jackson and other coaches loyal to Jackson were insulting Erman to other players behind Erman’s back. The team had no choice but to fire Erman. However, the front office is fond of Erman and was upset at having to let him go, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. The Erman firing and demotion of Brian Scalabrine have raised tensions throughout the Warriors’ organization.  &gt;  The tension with Erman got weird. Midseason, the team moved Erman’s parking spot to a less convenient place, likely at the behest of Jackson or one of Jackson’s allies on the staff, per multiple sources familiar with the matter. They began changing his duties in strange ways.

Reddit source through Erman's friend.

A lot of the team's business staff is homosexual (including Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee President Rick Welts) and so are members of the front office.   **Confirmed**  &gt; Jackson, according to a source close to the team, responded tersely: “Not in my locker room. will say this. We live in a country that allows you to be whoever you want to be. As a Christian man, I serve a God that gives you free will to be who you want to be. As a Christian man, I have beliefs of what’s right and what’s wrong. That being said, I know Jason Collins, I know his family, and am certainly praying for them at this time.”  [Source](https://sfbay.ca/2014/05/30/mark-jackson-on-gays-not-in-my-locker-room/)  ___  Didn't want to hire good assistants, and instead hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter.  **Confirmed**  &gt; Lacob: Carte blanche. Take my wallet. Do whatever it is to get the best assistants there are in the world. Period. End of story. Don’t want to hear it. And (Jackson’s) answer . . . was, ‘Well, I have the best staff.’ No you don’t. And so with Steve, very, very different. You can’t have a staff underneath you that isn’t that good. And if you’re going to get better, you’ve got to have really good assistants. You’ve got to have people that can be there to replace you. We all know this from all of our companies. It’s . . . Management 101. A lot of people on the outside couldn’t understand it when we (fired Jackson).  &gt; Lacob said he thought at the time when he hired Jackson that the key for an inexperienced coach who he said “didn’t know X’s and O’s, really” was to hire the right staff around him.

Worded differently but pretty much on point.  &gt; Within the team, he pitted players against each other to gain loyalty. “He’d say, ‘You’re my guy, and so-and-so is a clown,’” recalls one person with knowledge of the situation. “Then he’d go say the same thing to the other player, only reversed.”   [Source](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/02/20/golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-joe-lacob?page=4&amp;devicetype=phone) ___  Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc).  **Confirmed** &gt; Part of it was that he couldn’t get along with anybody else in the organization,” Lacob said. “And look, he did a great job, and I’ll always compliment him in many respects, but you can’t have 200 people in the organization not like you.”  [Source - Leung](https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/12/05/warriors-co-owner-lacob-lists-reasons-for-firing-mark-jackson/)  "

 I sort of believe that Jackson did cause locker room drama but nothing too major. The biggest evidence against locker room drama is that pretty much every player did not want Mark Jackson to leave.

"let me add some more that I know are true:  - attempted to fire Brian Scalabrine in front of everyone because Scal reported some of the internal conflict to the higher ups  - forced team to unceremoniously trade Kent Bazemore, close friend of Curry, because he didnt know how to use his skill-set, Baze's splits shot through the roof the moment he got to the Lakers  - was coached by Hilton Armstrong(a reserve player picked up mid season) how to play 4-on-3 and beat the Clippers' trapping schemes in the playoffs  - in same playoffs, while Doc was ""burning midnight oil"", Jackson was adamant there was no more film prep to be done  - would force team to stay extra days in LA so he could preach at his church EVERY road trip  - recorded sermons and motivational passages within the Oracle conference rooms, while draped in Warriors' insignia  - baited by coaches of the likes of Brian Shaw and Randy Wittman, to post up on crossmatched size differences(Klay on Nate Robinson) or isolate Jarrett Jack and make Curry stand and watch in the corner  - refused to let any Warriors personnel at practices, including Jerry West and Jim Barnett, nearly leading to JB retiring  - his buddy, Lindsey Hunter, routinely would ostracize players during practices and shootarounds, and often spent more time absent or being off task instead of coaching and instructing the players  see people that didnt follow didnt know, and they ate up Stephen A. Smith's race bait. There are plenty of violations that will keep him from getting another shot a coaching"
"Not denying that the warriors season was successful by any means. That was an amazing team, and they have all of my respect.  But there was a large margin of difference between the spurs with the corpse of Duncan, steep decline tony + Manu, new, not fully incorporated lamarcus Aldridge and a Kawhi that just emerged into true stardom.  And the warriors with unanimous MVP Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. "

"And until mid-90s, fouling on a 3-pointer only gave someone 2 free throws. If Stephen Curry went back in time to the 80s, he’d hit fewer threes because sometimes they’d rather send him to the line with a hard foul to make sure he can only get two points. He’d still be good, but his game would look a little different. "
"There's some goalpost shifting going on here. First you said he doesn't have it in his arsenal, now you're saying it's just a basic arsenal. And he's hyper-efficient, buuuut he does have a great team so it's not that impressive.   I already acknowledged he doesn't rely on his midrange game as much as the other players you mentioned, and I already said I won't argue with how you rank all time shooters, even though I disagree. You can definitely make an argument that he doesn't have the midrange volume to be compared statistically to the other players you mentioned, but that's not what you did. Please point out where any of those links make a comparison of the ""arsenal of moves"" that each player possesses.  I find it funny that instead you basically just defaulted to the ""all he does is shoot threes"" argument. Again, I'd ask you to watch more Steph Curry. His array of push shots and floaters combined with his normal quick-release jumpers are far from basic. He can score from anywhere on the floor. No postgame, you'll get no arguments from me there. But you're definitely overrating how important playing out of the post is for a guard in the modern era because it suits your preference. I noticed you also brought up the system he plays in benefiting his 2 point percentage, but failed to acknowledge that the same system is the one that skews his shooting splits so heavily towards the 3 pointer. There's clearly some bias here that we're not going to get past, so I'll leave this alone.    I looked through the articles you linked. From the SLOAN article:  &gt;We note that offensive rebound rates decrease as a function of shot distance with a sharp jump at the three-point line. This is very similar to effective field goal percentage as a function of shot distance. This result implies that mid-range shots are even worse than previously characterized due to their effects on offensive rebound rates. Strategically, teams have even more reason to eschew mid-range shots for shots closer to the basket or three-pointers  And  &gt;By leveraging a data-driven approach on optical tracking data, we are able to discover several insights about the nature of rebounding: (1) the effect of shot location on rebound rate that exacerbates the ineffectiveness of mid-range shots and improves the significance of three-pointers and close shots  The only advantage to the midrange I could find outlined in this article was that the shooter tends to be closer to the rebound.   The first Goldsberry article is an interesting piece on rebounding that doesn't make any sort of evaluation of shot type. In the second one he (rightfully) raves about CP's midrange prowess, but then ends with this hilariously contradictory gem:  &gt;Paul won’t win the MVP this season, but that’s fine. He’s still the MVPG.  You know who did win MVP that season and the next? At some point, you have to question if being more prolific with a certain shot type really matters when it doesn't translate to greater team and individual success. I'm gonna reiterate, if Chris Paul could shoot threes as well as Steph, he'd be shooting them a lot more.   From the third link, Dirk's 13-14 season was incredible for sure from a shooting standpoint, but I can say the same for every season Steph has had since then. Hell, he's number 2 in that same article. I don't think it's a stretch to say he's moved up a spot in the 4 years since then.   The last three articles are barely relevant to this discussion. The first one is just a subjective ranking based on usage and efficiency, doesn't make any judgement on 2's being better than 3's. The next one is a statistical summary from 2012--interesting for sure, but has little bearing on today's game. As for the Hakeem article, I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make. If one of your main arguments against Steph being the greatest shooter is that he doesn't have a post game, then good for you I guess? Just seems like nitpicking at that point because you don't like Steph or the Warriors.   So, overall, a lot of evidence that doesn't make as strong a point as you seem to think it does. I'm not denying that the midrange shot is and always will be an extremely valuable tool, but there is plenty of literature demonstrating how much more valuable the 3 pointer is.   https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/sports/basketball/how-the-nba-3-point-shot-went-from-gimmick-to-game-changer.html  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/  https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-first-shots-of-the-nbas-3-point-revolution-1523542076  https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mid-range-jumper-is-the-nbas-worst-shot-except-for-the-golden-state-warriors-1521557144  These are just the first few links I could rustle up. The last one is especially interesting because it points out how the Warriors actually make use of the midrange effectively *as a reaction to* defenses skewing towards the 3. If a lot of its value is derived from the fact that it's a backup option to a more valuable shot, then I'm not sure how your argument stands up. And all this is without bringing up the fact that I think your initial premise is completely false in the first place. How can the 3 *not* be inherently a more valuable shot? By definition, it's worth an extra point. You brought up a lot of extraneous evidence that shows the midrange is valuable, no doubt, but none of it points to 2 pointers being more valuable than 3's. Like I said before, it's easy to pick and choose what parts of the game you value most so you can prop up certain players and diminish other players, but you're being disingenuous in the process.  Good discussion regardless, I'm gonna step out here.  "
1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. James Harden  5. Russell Westbrook  6. Anthony Davis  7. Kawhi Leonard  8. Chris Paul  9. Giannis Antetokounmpo  10. (Honestly a toss-up between a bunch of different people)

"Trae Young: 6'0.50"" without shoes and a 6'3' wingspan  Stephen Curry: 6'2"" without shoes and a 6'3.5"" wingspan   Curry's frame is larger—shoulders, torso, legs, waistline, etc—so there's more room for muscle.

Lebron 11s-12s-13s and Foams are probably the strongest ankle support, and they don't prevent injuries. Any material that could would restrict movement so much that players would be completely ineffective. Steph wears ankle braces and still rolls his fifteen times a game it seems. These guys will be more than fine wearing these Pumas."
Stephen Curry
"I think it's not really about the championships, but the market.  Of all the teams in the NBA, the Lakers have the largest market by far. As far as I know, they're the only team that have their game broadcasted regularly in a language that's not English (Spanish), and up until *[last year](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18571714/kobe-bryant-stephen-curry-top-nba-jersey-sales-china)*, Kobe's jersey still tops the sales chart in China. Add that on top of an already large population in Southern California, and the fact that there's basically no winter in LA, it's just such an attractive club for players.   The Lakers are on the level of other truly international sports teams, like Real Madrid or the Yankees. The same can't really be said for the rest of the NBA."
I tried to tell y’all that Lebron will Opt in and get traded to the Warriors because Day and Klay won’t sign the extension this Summer.  Curry/Durant/Lebron will happen like Stephen A Smith said.  🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
"And if that is true I can completely understand that. When you are competing for finals trophies and advertising dollars with another player as popular as Stephen Curry that necessarily changes the nature of the relationship.   But that's a different thing than ""hates"" and I've heard some media describe it in the more nuanced way you did, and I've heard some describe genuine animosity. Of course I trust sports media about as far as I can throw them."
"“I still think I get overlooked sometimes,” Wall told The Vertical. “Some people say I’m not a top-five point guard. In my opinion, I think I’m top three.

That’s just being honest, but I just go out and compete and if I’m winning games, my game will do the talking for itself.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2016/02/26/john-wall-says-hes-a-top-three-point-guard-stephen-a-smith-says-hell-no/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.7d80577f2e8d"
"Same reason Lebron's FT percentage is an anomaly for his stats. His shooting motion, when he was in youth wasn't a mechanical shot. It's a very different shooting mechanic if you go from game to set up shot. It's a lot more efficient to go from set up to game shot. Look at Steph, he spent an entire year just changing his mechanic when he was in like middle or high school. It increased his ceiling a ton, but from what I remember somewhere said his range drastically decreased the year after.  Found a source: [http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-changed-shooting-form-nbas-greatest-shooter-2016-5](http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-changed-shooting-form-nbas-greatest-shooter-2016-5).  PS. I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure about Lebron, I assumed he didn't begin to really tailor his skills until he was in the NBA. And I coach a bit of youth basketball and have noticed a ton of kids chuck from their waist, and when you tell them to stand still and practice their shooting motion its just clank, short, clank, etc. While the kids who will after clanking it over and over, practice just their shot, end up having better development during the season. It's very young basketball, 5-10 years old lol."

" I could say the same about Dirk or Kobe who are generally around the top 15 all time.   Take a look at what was said about Curry after his junior season and keep in mind Trae is coming out as a freshman.   &gt; Because of the incredibly high difficulty of shots hes capable of converting, Curry has a **tendency to settle for a couple of truly awful attempts every game**, showing absolutely no conscious. Its difficult to gauge whether this has more to do with his role on the team, or if he just really overestimates his shooting ability at times.   &gt; As cool and composed as he looks on the court at all times, he may even be a little **too nonchalant on occasion, making some careless plays that lead to turnovers.** He does rank 14th in the NCAA in turnovers per-40 after all.   &gt; One of the bigger concerns about Currys offensive game is that he **does not project to become a prolific slasher at the NBA level.His first step is average at best**, and considering his **skinny frame** and **poor explosiveness** around the basket in traffic, its unlikely that hell be able to get to the free throw line anywhere near as much in the NBA as he does in college.   &gt; While he is a good ball-handler and is excellent at using change of speeds, fakes and hesitation moves to get by defenders, he **usually prefers to settle for a pull-up jumper rather than take the way all the way to the rim.** For that reason hell probably need to have some other shot-creators playing alongside him, especially in order to take full advantage of his perimeter shooting ability. He is extremely crafty about getting to the basket, really knowing how to exaggerate contact (some would say flopping) in order to draw fouls, which currently gets him to the line at a very nice rate.   &gt; Defensively, Curry puts a solid effort in, but is **extremely limited by his poor physical tools** on this end of the floor. He lacks great height, length or strength, and possesses below average lateral quickness, making him a **potential defensive liability when being matched up with some of the more explosive guards the NBA is known for.**  Source: http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Stephen-Curry-1170/ ©DraftExpress"

"The idea that Steph Curry ""floundered"" around his more talented teammate is ridiculous and unsubstantiated by statistics. In fact, without Stephen Curry the Warriors are vulnerable and not the team that people are used to seeing. I have never seen Stephen Curry being passive on the sidelines or looking like he doesn't want to be on the court. He gets frustrated but that is typical of any athlete competing at the highest level. The Ronaldo/Lebron comparison is much more accurate on the other hand. They essentially play the same role for both their teams, and are physical marvels of the game. "

Order number *****. BBB claimed this sweatshirt would make my son better than Stephen Curry and have more of an impact than Magic Johnson. But this sweatshirt can't shoot and it definitely is not even close to being the greatest laker of all time. It is not even 1/10th as handsome as Magic. Also I still have not received its jump shot. BBB also claimed it would lead my son to the playoffs in his first year and that hasn't happened. When I first emailed I was told by the sweatshirt's dad and business owner that my son's coach is dumb and that we aren't big ballers. Then he said if I bought the matching t shirt he would stop going on tv and causing trouble. I said I would trade this sweatshirt for a goat if he tried to blackmail me. So he agreed to shut up. But he hasn't. I have emailed 3 times since and all the replies are full of emojis and signed by someone named LaMelo LaMagnificent. This is unacceptable. Now I find the matching t shirt wherever I go. If I go to starbucks the tshirt and the dad are there telling me to take it to summer league. Well you had your chance with the sweatshirt and as much as I like that sweatshirt I don't want to sed any of you ever again       &gt;**Desired Resolution**      &gt;Give me my money back       &gt;**Consumer Business Dialog:**       &gt;**Business**        &gt;Magic you are truly a SMALL BALLER  that sweatshirt you ordered made the all rookie team!!! Also the t shirt just needs a chance AND just you wait til the matching shorts get here... The league of clothing is gonna change the rules to give them THREE MVPS!!! They're also gonna change it to MVBs for most valuable ballers .. also i would have beaten you in one on one in a game to eleven i would have won on my first possession you know why?

"Trae Young has the potential (albeit a  longshot) to be like Stephen Curry, especially in a system that gives him the ball and lets him play, like the Hawks will. If the Hawks can draft around him, look out. With a few supporting players they can go far.   Doncic is a system player that in the NBA will be fantastic with another superstar around him. Doncic is more like a Drazen Petrovic or a Penny Hardaway. He'll be amazing if he can team up with Westbrook or Anthony Davis or the like, but he'll struggle with the Mavs at first.  In my opinion, both players will be great. It's all about which system the teams want to implement. I think the Hawks want to build around a star rather than look for an established one to compliment their pick. "
Trae Young will take all the shoots in the Hawks and reveal himself to be Jimmer Fredette with some passing vision instead of Stephen Curry while Doncic starts his path to stardom.  Ayton should win ROY tho.

"First, a supermax contract is a very specific thing, and only four players (Stephen Curry, James Harden, John Wall &amp; Russell Westbrook) have it.  Second, LeBron's salary is less than Steph Curry's, so it's weird that you are claiming LeBron's being ""greedy with personal income.""  Third, taking less money to make it easier to be on a championship-level team only enriches the owners, and collectively hurts the negotiating position of every other player in the league. If you're ok with that, I guess it's easy to understand why you'd be a Warriors fan."
"[Trae Young](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/trae-young-1.html)  [Stephen Curry College](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/stephen-curry-1.html)  Notable stats for (Trae Young/Curry’s senior season)  PPG: (27.4/28.6)  MPG: (35.4/33.7)  FGA: (19.3/20.2)  FGM: (8.2/9.2)  FG%: (42.2/45.4)  2PA: (9.1/10.3)  2PM: (4.5/5.4)  2P%: (49.3/51.9)  3PA: (10.3/9.9)  3PM: (3.7/3.8)  3P%: (36/38.7)  FTA: (8.6/7.4)  FTM: (7.4/6.5)  FT%: (86.1%/87.6%)  TRB: (3.9/4.4)  AST: (8.7/5.6)  STL (1.7/2.5)  TOV: (5.2/3.7)  USG: (37.1/38.3)  SOS: (10.56/-3.33)  WS: (5.7/9.9)  So basically, Trae Young as a freshman was  slightly less efficient than Stephen Curry was as a senior with extremely similar usage (it’s actually insane how close most of the stats are).  The biggest difference is Trae Young had worse shot selection, but that could easily be attributed to playing more capable teams, as OU played in one of the best basketball conferences in the nation in the BIG 12 (Texas Tech, Kansas and Kansas State all made the elite 8, and WVU was one of the best teams in the country).  He had a tendency to press (was the absolute only playmaker on the team, the backup PG only had 9 assists all season), but were he playing for Kansas I think he would have had a college season that would be the equivalent of Curry’s  2015 season efficiency wise.  OU was absolutely god awful, and I’m a huge OU fan.  We had no business anywhere near the tourney, but he dragged us there anyways (although I admit Oklahoma State should have made it instead of us).     "

"I get it, but many people overstate the likelihood of a player actually improving their technical weaknesses.   Also athleticism can be improved, look at the stark change from Stephen Curry as a rookie to now. Look at Gordon Hayward as a rookie to now. It's like their completely different.

"Playing a 30-40-game college season is immensely different preparation than a 30-game high school season, even at the highest levels of prep ball. Oak Hill Academy would not beat a lower-seeded NCAA tournament team. It’s purely about discipline and intensity. That discipline instilled in college players by college coaches has carried over to the NBA in the last 10-12 years. The classes that went straight to the pros really struggled with the discipline necessary to maintain themselves over approximately 110 preseason, regular season and playoff games. Stephen Curry is case in point here too. He’s a leader because he learned how to be a leader. Where did he learn that? College. "

He was in the top 10 twice for ppg and total points.   Baron Davis was off the team by 2008, that's when Monta Ellis jumped from 20 ppg to 26 ppg. He had individual success from 2008-2015, and never played with another all star until 36 year old Dirk Nowitzki, or Rookie Steph Curry.

Because he has a similar playstyle to stephen curry who used to be mvp two times is my best guess. Still think doncic is way better.
"Another thing that GSW excels at, other than the talent and the GM. Is that, the top scorers of that team is just so unselfish, Stephen A mentioned this in one of his recent interviews. Curry Durant or Klay couldve taken max anytime even better than what they have right now but its the long term plans that they're interested in and not just take whatever they can right now.  This is why Rockets is getting fucked by CP3 right now."

"We can be more sure about Bronny given how amazing of an athlete LeBron James is and his height. Stephen Curry standing at 6""3 means his son might not be tall enough and he might not be athletic enough either. Seth Curry barely made the NBA because he wasn't a good enough athlete."
"ill explain.   Lebron is arguably the most athletic athlete of all time. Would dominate football even if he chose that route, off of sheer athleticism.   Because he’s so athletic, he’s so big and strong, and can get to anywhere he wants, he does, and no one can do anything about it. Thusly, he commands double teams, his men get open, you know what happens next.   This is good and all, but it’s rarely any good for his teammates because theyre not touching the ball except to shoot.   Curry, however, runs a system that allows everyone on the court to touch the ball, and make plays. Curry is so lethal a shooter, that defenses have to stretch to the half court line, and sometimes the full court line, because chances are he will splash in your face. On top of his handles, he’s ability to get open..he’s just a born basketball player. The type you wish you were on the blacktop, you know? The Kyries of the game.   Which leads me to the next point, another meaning and answer to your question. Those kids dreaming of being a basketball player on the blacktop? They’ll never be 6’9’’. Stephen Curry is relatable. Stephen Curry is better for the game of basketball to the average fan than Lebron. That’s why his jersey sales are so high. 6’3’’ isn’t out of reach, it’s realistic. Handles is realistic. A clip is realistic. Ball movement is realistic. Gives more kids hope"

"We’re not saying Curry chucks threes. It’s just that Trae Young is getting influenced by the media who perceives Curry can take any three pointer and make it, and after his college stint everybody sees a Curry face on a Hawk jersey. Trae Young is trying to play like an over-exaggerated Stephen Curry. Everybody knows Curry can do hella stuff on offense, but his three point shooting is highlighted the most and that’s what Trae Young sees himself as having to be similar to for the team to have success. I understand it’s summer league and this is his reps time, but it’s also a good time to develop other skills too before he has to play against all-star PGs like Stephen Curry, Cause we all know who wins that shootout if it happens between the two.

"Yeah there's an insider on the RealGM Bucks board with a really good track record of calling moves, and he had the Bucks in discussions with GSW for Curry well before the media reported stuff on a deal being in the works. This was in January 2012 before Curry hurt his ankle again.  After the injury the Bucks were apparently worried about adding another injured star player after dealing with Bogut's injuries for years. Herb Kohl the Bucks owner at the time only cared about making the playoffs so the Bucks opted to take Monta instead and try to compete that year. Bucks also got to unload Stephen Jackson which the Warriors wouldn't do if they dealt Curry.  [Here's a quote from Lacob after the trade was made:](http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/1708621-golden-state-warriors-nba-trade-monta-ellis-andrew-bogut-stephen-curry)  &gt;Warriors owner Joe Lacob turned that theory on its ear in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, when he admitted the team was also willing to trade Curry for Bogut.  &gt;Lacob said it was a tough decision to move Ellis, a player he has grown fond of. He also mentioned Curry and said the team would have moved either player to get the deal done.  &gt;“I’m getting chills talking about (Ellis) right now,” Lacob said. “He’s one of my favorite players in the NBA. Anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy. I feel very strongly about him. It was incredibly difficult to trade him, but he’s the piece it had to be to get Andrew Bogut. We would have traded either (Curry or Ellis) to take the next step for this franchise.”  "

[Serious] Would Stephen Curry be the best player in the league if he was better than LeBron James?
forgot Stephen Curry  edit found a [list](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/injuries?season=2017&amp;month=10&amp;page=1) 
"He’s trying too hard to be a Curry parallel. Stephen Curry is what I like to call a specialized archetype—he’s a type of player that does stuff that is extremely hard to replicate, and gets away with it because well, he developed it to suit himself. Trae Young needs to be a point guard first, get other players involved then after try to get into a grip of your own offense. You don’t have to be a 3pt chucker to be a good scorer, there’s 21 feet of court that can be used to develop your offense too."
"I think someone mentioned this already, but the central idea of the max contract (whether it was intended for this purpose or not) is to reward teams who have players who are clearly operating on a different stratus than everyone else. This way, there is a point to being the best player in the league - you provide more overal value to your team and thus are more likely to win.   Look at it this way: let's say each player's contribution to a game is able to be accurately measured, and he is paid exactly according to how much value he generates. Thus, money spend is proportional to contributions of players to the game, and consequently the team that spends the most money is the best team. Now, every team has the same salary cap, so any team with a GM who isn't an idiot would spend as much as that cap allows, and thus no team would be better than another. Now, isn't this parity what we're looking for? Not really, and I can only explain it with an example.   Let's say that in a hypothetical league, Giannis learns how to shoot like Stephen Curry. Now, that should be immense for Giannis and his team, because, assuming that the rest of the team wasn't altered, the Bucks would improve by quite a bit and surely be top dogs in the East for the next couple of years, possibly even dethroning Golden State. However, remember how a player is paid for the value he generates and each team has the same salary cap? Giannis's massive improvement in three-point shooting creates value, but because he would then be paid more for it, the team loses an equal amount of value somewhere else because they wouldn't have enough money to retain some of their other key pieces. Khris Middleton must walk, let's say. So overall, Giannis is much better, but the Bucks are no better than before, because they had to let Middleton go. Player improvement wouldn't translate to team improvement, and this would the competitive (not financial) incentive for players to improve and compete at the highest level.   Because we have a maximum contract, and the best of the best are actually underpaid, this means that their excellence actually help push their teams over the top, because a player who's underpaid is a player who is producing more than proportionally to his salary, creating bonus value - value that cannot be purchased when every team is at the salary cap. This is why superstars on their rookie contracts are the most valuable commodities in the entire league. It's also why teams actually become worse when their superstar's rookie contract is over and he must be paid according market value. Just look at the Nuggets, who had to lose a quality SF in Wilson Chandler because Jokic finally came off of his rookie contract.  If anything, instead of abolishing the max contract, the league needs to somehow institute a minimum contract to limit how underpaid a superstar choses to be, and thus limit how much extra value the superstar produces for his team. Extra value is absolutely necessary for the league so that the best players are the best because they help their team the most, but superteams such as the Warriors occur when there is too much extra value to the point where young players who are rightfully looking to make some money to support their futures are unable to win because older players (or more popular players in a big market teams with more sponsorship revenue), who are already financially established, are in a significantly better position to sacrifice more of their salary in order to create that extra value for their teams.

"Zaire wade, who is Cavs Legend Dwyane Wade's son does not stoop to the level of a role player who resides in the corners of the court to shoot three pointers like he isn't the star of the team in a similar fashion to the playstyle of Jonathon Clay Redick. Zaire is a deity form of Stephen Curry but without the cowardly tendencies. Zaire will handle the ball and then stop his forward motion to shoot a three point shot from the centre of the court where traditionally the icon of the home team is placed, while performing this feat he will also engage in a physical alternation with yourself simultaneously."
"I really think that the NBA fans as a whole underrate how much Dame probably hates Stephen Curry.  Curry is the starting point guard, arguably most valuable player on a multi-championship winning team....that is only a few bus stops away from where Dame grew up.   I don't know how he wouldn't be able to have natural resentment toward Steph, so fuckit lets join the Lakers and overthrow him/get to play him constantly in the same division.  Also supports that theory that triggers all Bay Area residents: YOU WERE LAKERS FANS BEFORE THIS ERA! (Not my belief, just always relevant out here)"
"Warriors shouldn't have won in 2015, but should have gone 16-0 in 2016. Adam Silver robbing the Warriors of that championship + Stephen Curry's injuries ultimately ruined the parity in the league with the signing of Durant. No Curry injury, Warriors win in 2016 and we get to see the best of him for the following seasons. They are still finals favourites without Durant. Curry also deserved the FMVP in 2015, 2017 and 2018. Fuck Durant"

And I was backing up his story all over YouTube. If it was 2 yr 18 mil. I can kinda understand or if all the other teams offered him 5-8 mil I can kinda understand with his devastating injury but he turned down 2 yrs 40 mil for a 5.3 mil to play for the Warriors with a tore Achilles tendon. I'm not supporting his bullshit story anymore. Hate on his ass! I'm still a Warriors Stephen Curry fan though.

"The only legacy they should care about its the one they leave on Golden State and they are gonna be Loved Forever!!, and Stephen Curry legacy is not only winning with Golden State after the franchise dark years but he is also the GOAT shooter."
Stephen Curry literally has a period once a month.
" The Golden State Warriors Have Broken the NBA   The reigning NBA champions now have another All-Star in DeMarcus Cousins, and the entire league is left to wonder: What’s the point?  Free agent DeMarcus Cousins agreed to a one-year, $5.3 million deal with the Golden State Warriors.   Remember when the Los Angeles Lakers signed LeBron James? That was adorable.   The Golden State Warriors responded to one of the most seismic moves the NBA has ever seen on Monday night by reminding the other 29 teams in the league they’re only nominally playing the same game. They pulled off the surprise of the summer: a one-year, $5.3 million bargain deal with free agent DeMarcus Cousins. Which means they now have five players from last year’s NBA All-Star Game on the same team that won last year’s championship, and the one the year before that, and probably next year’s, too.   Now it’s worth asking the question that echoed around the league as demoralized teams began to reckon with the depressing reality that the Warriors, who are coming off what is statistically the best four-year stretch in the history of professional basketball, might have gotten even better: Um, how?   The first thing that’s important to understand is that the DeMarcus Cousins they’re getting isn’t the DeMarcus Cousins who is used to demolishing the other extraordinarily large human beings who call themselves NBA centers. Not too long ago, Cousins was described as “the best big man in our game” by someone who would know: LeBron James.   But there’s a reason he was there for the taking. The four-time All-Star tore his Achilles tendon in January, a devastating injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the season and should keep him on the bench for his first few months in Golden State, and not even the Warriors are light years enough ahead of the NBA to know how Cousins will recover. He could be a shadow of himself, and his mercurial personality could upset the Warriors’ chemistry, and things could get so bad for Golden State they might actually lose a game in the Finals. Or he could be the discount they didn’t need.   Cousins was worth the gamble either way. And that’s because it wasn’t really a gamble.   This was supposed to be a tricky off-season for the Warriors. The Houston Rockets, Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics were all coming for them, and they figured they couldn’t be as aggressive as usual since the most they had to offer any free agent was the $5.3 million reserved for the tax-payer mid-level exception. They were eyeing the right sort of role player for that money. Instead they got another superstar on the cheap by taking advantage of the NBA’s bear market. And they were as stunned as everyone else. It wasn’t their plan, but the whole point of free agency is to let players decide where they want to play, and they weren’t going to turn this player down.   It’s possible their starting lineup in next year’s playoffs—Cousins, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Kevin Durant—will have as many All-Stars as every Toronto Raptors team combined. The Warriors already had more talent than any team ever assembled. Now, if Cousins is healthy, they have even more.   So the NBA will be consumed in the coming months by endless chatter about how the league is unfair, the season is already over and the Warriors have ruined the sport. It might sound awfully familiar by now. The last time this happened was the summer of 2016. The Warriors signed Kevin Durant to a 73-win team, and you’ll never guess what happened next.   But here’s the thing: The Warriors have Cousins for the same reason they already had Durant.   NBA quickly realized after the windfall of its $24 billion television deal that it had an unexpected problem: too much money too soon. The league proposed slowly injecting all that revenue over the course of several years. The players’ union rejected the idea. What could have been a smooth growth curve turned into a spike.   The salary cap increased by so much in the summer of 2016 that it packed a decade’s worth of inflation in one year. Almost every team had more money than it knew how to spend. And most of them spent unwisely. The Warriors are one of the few teams that don’t regret their decisions from that summer. They got Kevin Durant. The rest of the league got agita.   The ripple effects of that summer are still being felt today. It’s the reason the unlucky players who happen to be free agents this summer find themselves squeezed. The cap spike that helped Durant and came back to haunt Cousins.   In this environment of NBA austerity, few teams had the cap space to splurge on a player who commanded a maximum contract, and fewer teams would commit to a moody big man recovering from a brutal injury. The market for Cousins was surprisingly cool. The same player who made $18 million last season and could’ve signed a five-year contract worth about $175 million this summer decided to settle for $5.3 million and bet on himself.   But his ruptured Achilles could turn out to be an unlikely stroke of luck. He’s now in basketball paradise on a team good enough on the court to ease him back from his rehabilitation and secure enough off the court to salvage his reputation around the league. If all goes right for Cousins—who averaged as many 3-point attempts last season as Durant and allows the Warriors to play small ball with a lineup bigger than most regular-sized lineups—he wins a championship, tests free agency when bad contracts start to come off the books next summer and demands a huge raise. The optimal scenario for the Warriors is that Cousins plays well enough that not even they can afford him.   Which is why the easiest way to understand the latest plot twist of this NBA off-season is to simply laugh at the absurdity of it all. Like any good joke, this one involves the New York Knicks.   All you need to know about the insanity of this summer is that the Knicks are paying Mario Hezonja more than what the Warriors are paying DeMarcus Cousins."
"Also fun fact Stephen Curry was born in Akron, OH "
"Warriors is not bad for the league. They are the epitome of building a dominate team with good management who were able to draft well. Drafting good players and and signing high character guys allowed them build a culture that players want to be apart of. Management also made key decisions (although may have been unpopular at that moment) such as trading Monta and firing Mark Jackson. We also aren’t considered a big market team. Stephen Curry didn’t even want to be drafted here, he wanted to be in NYC. Say what you want about KD and Boogie coming here but it just speaks to how well this team has been built from the ground up after we have struggled years of horrendous basketball with lottery picks of Ike Diogu, Anthony Randolph, Brandon Wright, and Patrick O’Bryant. "
"Finally someone gets it.  KD makes more through increased endorsements by winning titles than he loses through decreased salaries.  &gt; That’s big for Durant. He is going to the Warriors in order to chase a championship, and probably more than one. But, even if he is facing some bad reviews on his free-agent decision now, he will get an added bonus over time: a sizable jump on his résumé of endorsements.  http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-marketing-value-golden-state-warriors-q-scores-lebron-james-stephen-curry/1nlcro7n3kro1dncmmghhn0yt"
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/06/06/stephen-curry-is-the-highest-paid-player-in-the-nba.html  I mean they had Steph on a 4 year deal after his ankles had shown signs of weakness and before he had become the “Skyfucker” we know now. The Warriors just had everything workout and then KD went full snek 
"""Cousins has played at a fast pace before, first under George Karl and then Alvin Gentry, but even then he was not exactly rushing back on defense. He has rarely sustained the pace Golden State's best lineups prefer.  At low points in both Sacramento and New Orleans, he sometimes loafed so badly that you would see nine players on the television screen for an alarming number of consecutive seconds. He loves to hold the ball and post up for buckets -- things the Warriors do not do.  He might exacerbate Golden State's one unshakable bad habit: maddening turnovers. In something of a point-center role last season, Cousins coughed up five turnovers per game -- the third highest such figure ever for a rotation player. There are few things that bust a team's integrity more severely than a player who throws bad passes, and then mopes instead of getting back on defense.""  ""His effort within half-court defense is inconsistent -- a trait the Warriors have generally not accepted of any core player. He doesn't have the speed or stamina to switch over and over.  Given good health, it is hard to imagine any five-man group with Cousins usurping the Death Lineup -- Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green -- as the Warriors' best overall and crunch-time go-to. There is no shame in that. Cousins can't make the Warriors much better because it is mathematically impossible for a team this good to get much better.""  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23979341/zach-lowe-demarcus-cousins-golden-state-warriors-nba"
"&gt;Imagine trying to keep your eye on the two greatest shooters in NBA history in [Stephen Curry](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1685204/stephen-curry) and [Klay Thompson](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1647559/klay-thompson), quite possibly the greatest pure scorer in history in Durant, and even if you somehow manage to stop those three (which you won't), you now have to deal with a seven-footer who averaged 25 points and 13 boards last year. Then, even if you shut all four of those guys down, you have a borderline Hall of Famer in [Andre Iguodala](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/498289/andre-iguodala) COMING OFF THE BENCH. Then, on the less than 1 percent chance all those guys are having an off night on the same night, the Warriors, behind one of the 10 best defenders ever in [Draymond Green](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1992792/draymond-green), have the best defense in the league, too  This."
"3 team trade  Warriors receive: Allan Crabbe, Bismack Biyombo  Nets receive: Kevin Durant  Magic receive: Stephen Curry "
Stephen curry is fuckin naruto out here
"As a Warriors fan, I'm probably just gonna watch with an extremely morbid curiosity just to see exactly how good this year's Warriors team is.  Will it be exciting for me in the beginning? Oh hell yes.   Will it be as exciting as the season goes on? I don't know, but probably not. I remember by the end of the last regular season, I just watched Stephen Curry highlights from the games (since Curry is my favorite player lol)."
"Marc Spears of The Undefeated revealed the following information about Cousins' free agency and how he chose the Warriors:  &gt;""I talked to a very emotional Demarcus Cousins ... he told me he got zero offers. Zero offers. So he was certainly confused, he was certainly hurt. He said about 5am in the morning in Vegas, he got on his balcony, thought about everything, called his agent -- woke him up -- and started talking about different scenarios.  &gt;""And one of the scenarios was going to the Warriors. So early in the morning, he called Bob Myers and talked to him. Bob said he was certainly shocked that Demarcus called him ... then after that, Demarcus said he spoke with Stephen Curry, he spoke with Kevin Durant, he spoke with Draymond Green...  &gt;""It lifted his spirits and really made him want to come. Stephen Curry’s excitement surprised Cousins and even pushed him towards the Bay Area even more.  &gt;""So then after that, a little bit past 8 eastern time, Demarcus Cousins called Golden State and said he was coming. He called it his chess move. He called it his ace...” "
"Among all of the super team talk that floods the GSW headlines and comment sections, I feel like the absurd juggernaut that is Stephen Curry is *constantly* being forgotten about, slept on, and under-appreciated.     The dude will more than likely finish as the greatest PG of all time. He is the best shooter the league has **ever seen.** His ability to drive &amp; finish at the rim despite being mauled constantly is just ridiculous + he hardly ever complains about no-calls.     He’s just a fucking beast &amp; it’s unfortunate that people aren’t going to give him credit for all of this right now because of some petty shit towards KD. "

"This is the year 2100.  Technology has allowed humans to live for 1000 years.   The NBA Champion, for the 87th time, is the Golden State Warriors.  At the age of 112, Stephen Curry is the oldest man to win an NBA title. The near-immortal cyborg lineup of Steph, Klay, Draymond, KD, and Boogie is currently the oldest ever starting lineup to win an NBA title. On the bench are Andre Iguodala, Steph Curry III, Klay Thompson III, Draymond Green III, Kevin Durant III, Demarcus Cousins III, Gianluigi Buffon, and Tom Brady. Steve Kerr, now 75% robot, is the first cyborg to win 1 million games."
"Fair enough, they weren’t. I guess it loses credibility in terms of like, individual accolades, but as much as I fucking love Stephen Curry, Klay, and Draymond, at the end of the day I’m a Warriors fan, above all. So it stinks to see, especially, Steph’s career maybe not get as much “props” as it could have, but I’ve been with this team since I was like 7 and I’ll take as much success as we can get. I guess that most of y’all aren’t saying I shouldn’t enjoy it, so I should probably just STFU, but I’m also not gonna the few that thing these accolades are literally meaningless go undisputed. Bill Russell’s accolades aren’t considered meaningless, and his team was evidently more stacked than ours, at least in terms of success. I guess I’ll leave it at that, and Go Dubs"
 All nba team...  PG: Stephen Curry (1st team)   SG: Klay Thompson (3rd)   SF: Kevin Durant (2nd)   PF: Draymond Green (2nd)   C: DeMarcus Cousins (2nd) 
this sub acts as though teams and palyers arent supposed to do whats best for them ...  warriors have a serious need of a proper centre... they almost lost this season to the rockets and also were one layup away from losing to the cavs game 1...  warriros have to keep improving   cousins has to heal and waht better way than doing it with a team that can give you great healthcare (see stephen curry healing) that is also the best team?   this is a mutually beneifical choice and its not the warriors fault other teams arent as good   id be surprised if cousins plays much until march
The Warriors are an All-NBA starting lineup from the 2015-16 season.  PG: Stephen Curry (1st team)  SG: Klay Thompson (3rd)  SF: Kevin Durant (2nd)  PF: Draymond Green (2nd)  C: DeMarcus Cousins (2nd)

"So is Lebron James,  So is James Harden, So is Stephen Curry,  But yet they are not slacking off"
"**NARRATIVES**  2007 - LeBron cements himself as one of the greatest, being the best player in that Finals at age 22. Tim Duncan losing hurts his greatest PF of all time status.  2011 - LeBron winning a ring was expected, but removes the narrative that LeBron is a choker. Dirk again loses in the Finals, probably finishing his career without a championship. As LeBron played worse than D-Wade, D-Wade would probably end up winning Finals MVP which would hurt LeBron's GOAT status.  2012 - Kevin Durant is now discussed as the best player in the league? LeBron, D-Wade, and Bosh are still healthy and in their prime at this time. In real life 2012 Kevin Durant played amazing, it was James Harden who played horrible in the Finals. Narrative of Kevin Durant and Westbrook ""carrying"" their squad past the Heatles.  2013 - Tim Duncan gets his revenge with their revamped motion offense that won them the chip in 2014 in the real time line and almost 2013 as well. First back to back Finals losses for LeBron James. Hurts his legacy on GOAT status.  2014 - LeBron is now 2-1 vs Tim Duncan in the Finals. Don't think Duncan would be considered GOAT PF as he finishes his career with only 3 rings. LeBron in this alternate timeline ties the real LeBron with a total of 3 rings.  2015 - First back to back championships for LeBron as he leads his team without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love vs the upcoming Warriors. LeBron nearly approaches GOAT status at this point, winning a chip without his two best players, something Michael Jordan hasn't done.  2016 - Actually expected as they faced a 73 win Warriors team. Doesn't hurt LeBron's legacy and can arguably help his case for GOAT, as he took the ""greatest team of all time"" to a seven game series.  2017 - ""The greatest team of all time"" upgraded themselves with Kevin Durant -\_- But LeBron at this point earns himself the title of GOAT as he defeats the Warriors with Kevin Durant in 5 games. Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry have their legacies ruined.  2018 - LeBron thought 5 games was too merciful and to crush all the doubters (Skip Bayless), LeBron sweeps the Warriors this time around in 4 games. LeBron even handicapped himself by sending Kyrie Irving to Boston. The Warriors roster will definitely be gutted, with the core of Draymond, Klay, Curry, and Durant all having their legacies permanently stained and going their separate ways.  At this point in time LeBron is 6-3 in the Finals with 5(6) Finals MVP's. D-Wade wins it in 2011.  **FOR G.O.A.T**  6 Championships  5 Finals MVPs  9 Finals Appearaces  Sweeping Spurs Big 3 at age 22  Beats 2015 Warriors without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love  Beats upgraded Warriors with Kevin Durant in 5 games  Sweeps 2018 Warriors without Kyrie Irving  **AGAINST G.O.A.T**  D-Wade ""carried LeBron in 2011"", as D-Wade won Finals MVP  LeBron lost in 2012 to a young Thunder team while LeBron, Wade, and Bosh were healthy and in their prime  Lost again in 2013 to the Spurs, as LeBron lost back to back Finals which never happened to Michael Jeffery Jordan.  Losing in 2016 puts LeBron at a total of 3 Finals losses, where Michael Jordan is 6-0.  **CONCLUSION**  LeBron would definitely be the GOAT in this alternate timeline."
Stephen Curry
It’s tough because Lebron James and Kobe are two of my favourite players of all time but I also like Stephen Curry 😬

"I don't know why we're saying that the West is overwhelmingly better than the East in the NBA right now. The East has 5 teams we could see in the finals next year: Celtics, Pacers, Bucks, 76ers, or Raptors. Meanwhile the West is only trending on 4: Warriors, Rockets, Pelicans, or Jazz (Lakers aren't there yet, sorry).   Now of those Eastern teams projected to compete there are 10 all stars and the Western teams have 9. Meaning that when it comes to teams competing for a title the East averages 2 all stars per team and the West averages 2.25. BUT WAIT the Warriors have 4 of those 9 all stars. So the 3 Western teams remaining actually average 1 per team while the East still averages 2 because of the even distribution in the East.  But wait, all stars are divided by conference anyways so maybe all the really good players are in the West already. We need something more universal. Let's see who was polling highest in the MVP voting from December-April. The East had 6: Kyrie Irving, Victor Oladipo, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Demar DeRozan, and John Wall. And of those competing teams in the West there are 4- Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, and James Harden. Mathematically speaking that means we have 1 team in the West competing for a title consistently without an MVP candidate- good work, Utah.  Another thing to note about the East are the rookies this year. 76ers have Ben Simmons, the Celtics have 40,000 all star rookies, the Raptors had 2 candidates that were trending near rookie of the year criteria throughout the season. Annnnd then those Western conference teams just had Donovan Mitchell with some mild sparks from Jordan Bell.  In terms of the post-season, the only season that counts, no one is consistently challenging the Warriors and everyone is challenging the Cavs. LeBron struggled to compete in the East this year despite having the average number of all stars on his roster and one of the greatest collection of role-players in the league. LeBron left the East because he wasn’t competitive enough to stay there.  Yeah.. that’s the end of my rant"

Is Stephen Curry really that good or is he just a system player on the Warriors?  I mean he basically just shoots 3's.  He's undersized even for a point guard and is at best an average defender.  Would he even be an all-star if he wasn't playing in Steve Kerr's up tempo motion offense?
What's next? Is Stephen Curry really that good? Or is he just another system role player on the Warriors?  Every one is a system role player on the warriors apparently but Steve Kerr gets no credit for designing this amazing system that makes mediocre role players look good.
"As well as Anthony Davis, Shaq, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden and loads of better players that didn’t get the opportunity to get carried by Shaq and a loaded roster in 09-10.  Are people really forgetting Kobe shot below league average TS% in every finals he ever played in except 1? Dude consistently choked in the finals and got carried by his teammates to rings. "
Did you forget about the GOAT Stephen Curry?
"Active players who've made All-NBA 1st team, by current conf.:  West LeBron James Kevin Durant James Harden Stephen Curry Anthony Davis Kawhi Leonard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook DeAndre Jordan Marc Gasol Dirk Nowitzki Derrick Rose  East Joakim Noah  TBD Dwight Howard Dwyane Wade"
"There was a while where Steph's ankle looked like it might never be right.  I don't think people were questioning his talent back then, just seemed like he might not play long enough to hit his ceiling.  Right after Curry resigned for 4 years $44 million in 2012 Zach Lowe wrote about how that signing was a risk for the Warriors ([http://grantland.com/the-triangle/sticking-point-why-ty-lawson-and-stephen-currys-new-deals-matter/](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/sticking-point-why-ty-lawson-and-stephen-currys-new-deals-matter/)).  A bunch of very smart people were wondering if that signing would be an albatross for the Warriors if his ankles never recovered."
I highly doubt the warriors are too scared of them.  KD teammates vs LeBron's EVEN if the Lakers trade BI for Kawhi while keeping Ball and Kuzma:  Stephen Curry &gt; Kawhi Leonard  Klay Thompson &gt; Lonzo Ball  Draymond Green &gt; Kyle Kuzma  Etc.
"At the time...  Stephen Curry was coming off of a season in which his ankles were fucked and he played on 26 games. There were questions if he was ever going to be healthy.  Klay was coming off of a rookie season that was pretty good, but nothing eye-popping or really exciting.  Draymond was just some 2nd rounder who they had drafted 6 weeks prior.  The best player on the team was David Lee, and the rotation consisted of players like Brandon Rush, Dorrell Wright, Nate Robinson, Dominic McGuire, Charles Jenkins, Ekpe Udoh, and Andris Biedrins.   EDIT: Oh, and the Thunder were coming off of their first Finals appearance with their budding superteam of Durant, Westbrook, and Harden. It looked like they were poised to run the West for a decade."

Yea - Kuzma's career can't reach superstar potential. It might end up like Stephen Curry or something who played three years of college. What trash.
"Stephen Curry was in college for three years. Would you consider him an anomaly? Saying the Kuzma's of the NBA potential can't reach the top is silly.  Steve Nash 4 years college player.   Tim Duncan 4 year college player.  Athletically these guys may not compare (Tim was way more athletic before his leg injury but that came early in his career), but you are undervaluing hard work and BBIQ."

Stephen loves helping kids (him and Kerr always visit sick kids), but he can't seem to hit a shot to save his own life if it's also for children's charities. "
LMFAO They got a guy named Stephen Curry to play Stephen Curry and the dude played a jockey in one movie
Swapping Stephen Curry*
Yes I trust Wardell Stephen Curry with my life.
"Players they've passed up in that time:  2009: Stephen Curry, DeMar DeRozan (drafted Tyreke)  2010: they drafted DMC so they did fine this year  2011: Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard (drafted Biyombo and traded him for Jimmer. lol)  2012: Damian Lillard, Andre Drummond, Draymond Green (drafted Thomas Robinson)  2013: Giannis (drafted Ben McLemore)  2014: there were no franchise players that were picked after them  2015: there were no franchise players that were picked after them  2016: there were no franchise players that were picked after them  2017: Jayson Tatum was taken with the pick they traded to Philadelphia. Also Donovan Mitchell was available with both of their picks.  When you're picking top 10, there's a pretty good chance there's a franchise player out there.  Let's put this another way- they've only won more than 30 games twice since 2008, they won 33 and 32 games in those seasons. This comes down to semantics, but I feel very comfortable in saying a team that regularly wins less than 30 games is bad."
It was the [top player from each conference](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/18/cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-named) - I assumed it was the top 2 players overall. I guess we'll see Team Giannis/Kawhi/Embiid/Kyrie against Team LeBron.
This is the first nice thing I've seen Stephen Curry say about LeBron James.

""A really good relationship. With not only John, but his family. We talk all the time.""  &gt;James met Wall a couple of years ago at the LeBron James Skills Academy in Akron, which is a star showcase that Nike runs at University of Akron every July. Not only is it a prime recruiting ground for the nation's top collegiate programs, but it's a golden meet-and-greet for James, who has been developing personal relationships with stars in the making.  &gt;Stephen Curry, who also was an ""it"" college guard, had a chance mingle and play with James at the camp.  &gt;""[Wall] came to my All-American camps so I got an opportunity to watch him a lot.

"Rondo, Russ, and Wall may get more assists, but they’re not better playmakers. The Rondo one is straight up ridiculous. He’s an assist hunter that hasn’t been shown to actually improve his teammates while Curry has a league leading impact on teammates.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/  Here’s an article that makes a case for Curry being the best offensive facilitator in basketball. The data is from last season, but it also holds true when you look at how mediocre the Warriors’ offense was without Curry this season. "
"There's a great article about the different approaches from each league: [Why the NFL and the NBA are So Far Apart on Social Justice Stances](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/sports/nfl-nba-social-justice-protests.html)  &gt;Over a 16-hour period last September, President Trump took aim at the country’s two most popular sports leagues, the N.F.L. and the N.B.A.  &gt;In a speech on a Friday night in Alabama, Trump used an expletive to refer to professional football players who were kneeling during the national anthem as a form of silent protest against police brutality, and he said they should be fired. The next morning, he took to Twitter to tell Stephen Curry and the N.B.A. champion Golden State Warriors they were not welcome at the White House.  &gt;The N.F.L. hasn’t recovered. The N.B.A. hasn’t looked back."
"First of all, let me say this: I hate when ranking are universally accepted. I think people having different opinions is totally normal, and you shouldn’t be shamed for thinking for example Kobe is better than LeBron or LeBron is better than MJ. Lets get into why KD is always ranked as a top 2 player right now when Curry sometimes does not crack the top 3.  TRANSCENDENT SCORER: Kevin Durant is a 4 time NBA scoring leader, despite playing his whole career with one or more ball dominant players. I have never, in my years of watching the NBA, seen a smoother scorer. He averages 27.1 ppg for his career on incredible 49/38/88 shooting FOR HIS CAREER. Including down years and being a young player, he has shown to be completely dominant from basically everywhere inside half court.  NOT JUST A SCORER: KD is in most people opinions, including mine, the best scorer in the league. He is somehow much more than a scorer. He has career averages of 7 rebounds and 4 assists per night. He has improved his passing throughout his career, going from not averaging 3 assists until his 5th year to consistently putting up 4.5-5.5 a night. He has averaged 8 or more rebounds a night three times. He averages over 1 steal and one block per game for his career, including a videogame-esque 1.8 bpg last year.  UNREAL PHYSICALS: Kevin Durant came into the league listed as 6’9, which is a little above average for a small forward. He has admitted this was a lie to avoid playing the power forward spot. He is actually a near 7 footer at least, with the handling and passing of a point guard. He is so athletic and smooth for his size. Like Curry, he was mocked for his strength (or lack thereof), but has shown he is so physically gifted everywhere else that it legitimately does not matter.  Stephen Curry is hands-down the best shooter in the history of our sport. He is an underrated passer and defender. He is NOT as good of a scorer as Kevin Durant. He is NOT as good of a team defender as Kevin Durant. Curry is by no means one dimensional, but Kevin Durants is a much more complex scorer, and with his unbelievable size, he is basically un-guardable. It is not ridiculous to say Curry is better than Durant, but Durant is clearly a player that we may never see again. He has basically everything you could ever want (on the court) to make him a superstar."

I mean obviously the secret to pulling off this move is to just be Stephen Curry. Should be no big deal really. 
[@wvpv](https://twitter.com/wvpv/) [3:42 PM - 13 Jul 2009](https://twitter.com/wvpv/status/2620155170)    &gt; i think stephen curry will be a bust in the nba.  am i wrong? 
"Nope, I resort to doing this because I want consistency and not biased arguments.  &gt; Unless you think that Kawhi and Anthony Davis are better players than Stephen Curry, you’re opinion is contradictory and offers no value.  No idea what you're even saying. All I'm saying is that you cannot use one argument for one player and another for a different player. That's being rational, unless you have no idea what logic is.    "
"Of course, you know I’m right so you resort to doing this. The only person who’s opinion has no value is you when you’re purposefully being thick. Unless you think that Kawhi and Anthony Davis are better players than Stephen Curry, you’re opinion is contradictory and offers no value."
"You guys realize james harden was never what he is now while he was in OKC right? Theres a reason why they traded him and thats because KD AND Russ was better than him at that point. And also owner didnt wanna pay lux tax so thats a yeet. Giving harden the spotlight in houston paved the way for him to become the best SG in the league. When KD left to be a ring chaser, that freed up space for Russ to break the record for most Trip-Doubles in a season and have 2 consecutive trip-doub seasons. Harden and Russ needed their own team to show the world that they were living under KD's spotlight. ALSO the reason why GS can win championships and maintain 4 superstars, is because they are a team. Stephen curry is humble, Klay is just quiet, KD is a whore, and Green doesnt care about stats, he cares about everybody knowing him as part of the original 73-9 team, having one of the highest basketball IQs in the league, and having a lead supporting role in one of the greatest animated movie franchises in history. Thats why he took a stat drop down to 11ppg :(  in conclusion. OKC couldnt stay as they were being the big 3 because they just had too much superstar ego in them."
"Kobe is, as stated by many Lakers, to be the greatest Laker.   Steph IS more important to the Warriors playstyle and offense. KD is necessary for those iso moments, because he can shoot over anyone. But the spacing and ball movement and 3 pt revolution, that’s all singlehandedly steph. Do not forget the 2014-2016 seasons boi  But the heart of what makes the Warriors the Warriors is Draymond Green, and the engine is Stephen Curry. Or is that supposed to be inverse?  Steph’s MVP season is more impressive than KD’s. "
"Westbrook is obviously a great player, but he has major flaws. Despite his stats, there's no reason the Thunder shouldn't have beaten the Jazz. He's better than Kyrie, but not as great as people make him out to be. His playmaking is very questionable, and to be great in this league, your play and stats have to translate to decisive wins.   Best PGs:  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden  3. Westbrook  4. CP3 5. Kyrie"
"......Russ is obviously really good but he's not the most complete guard in the game right now. His offball defense is legitimately bad.  The most ""complete"" guard right now is probably still CP3. Can create offense for himself and others, can shoot and play offball alongside Harden, an excellent defender.  The ""best"" guard right now is still Stephen Curry though. His offensive cheat-code wizardry is so far ahead of every other guard it makes up for his on-ball defensive liabilities (he's a solid off-ball / team defender)."
"For the Bulls, I would want Stephen Curry. With shooters at the two, four and five positions, Curry would be deadly as hell with that team. "

"Curry and Durant are insanely underrated, especially Curry. If you look at the advanced stats, just look at the number of players with a better season than Curry or Durant's peak to figure this out.  **PER**  * Players higher than Curry: Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan * Players higher than Durant: Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, David Robinson, Shaquille O'neal, Russell Westbrook, Dwyane Wade, Tracy McGrady, Chris Paul, and Kareem Abdul Jabaar.

Curry Rank: 4th, Durant Rank: 15th  In addition to these stats, Curry has the 2nd highest +/- in NBA history in 2015-2016 (only behind 2015-2016 Draymond Green), but has the higher +/- per 48 minutes in NBA history for his 2016-2017 season.  RPM has only been around since 2013-2014, but Curry has the 2nd highest in that time in 2014-2015, behind only Lebron James' 2015-2016 season. Durant is the 12th player in terms of best RPM seasons.  It seems pretty clear that Curry is in that Top 3 group with Lebron/Jordan, while Durant is pretty safely in the Top 15 players going by the advanced stats. "
"Let me explain this to you. I've never seen a player as good as 15-16 Stephen Curry. He led his team to a 73 win record and then would have destroyed everyone in the playoffs if he didn't get a serious ankle injury. He continues to this day to get snubbed Finals MVP's from KD even though it's been clear that he's a better player the last 2 finals. If were talking greatest primes ever, no one beats Steph. As for Dirk being in front of LeBron, old man Dirk beat LeBron in his prime, so you have to give it to Dirk. Don't let any of this distract you from the fact that I assigned every player a number and used a random number generator to come up with my list. David Robinson is number 2 because of how dominant he was in his prime as well. Guy was the best physical force of all time down low there in the 90's Everyone wants to talk about how unstoppable Shaq was, but Robinson was something else. He AVERAGED 3 blocks for his career. KD's at 3 because he's a 7 foot elite athlete, ball handler, shooter, finisher. Guy is simply a freak of nature and a top 3 scorer ever."
"Let me explain my case to you. Hakeem is a pretty damn good player. He's probably the best defender of all time and he could score on you at will. The reason he isn't commonly referred to higher is because he played in the same era as the GOAT MJ. MJ left the league for 2 years though and Hakeem destroyed the league and won 2 titles. He made Shaq, another all time great, look like a fool as he swept him in the NBA Finals. Don't let this distract you from the fact that I assigned every player a number and then used a random number generator to come up with my list. Stephen Curry is No. 2 because he's the most efficient scorer of all time and has completely revolutionized the league. I have Duncan higher because he was an absolute beast throughout his whole career and consistently showed out in the playoffs. I like Kobe, but I just don't see him being better than these other guys in his prime."

We will see though. Stay tuned."
That's precisely why you see those videos of Stephen getting fouled off ball trying to get free and the refs let it go because if they didn't he'd be putting up bigger numbers.  If the refs gave Curry the treatment Harden gets in the regular season he'd be dropping 40 a night.
WOW Golden State Warrior got great starting 5 line up Stephen Curry Klay Thompson Kevin Durant Draymond Green and Demarcus Cousins 
"If Stephen Curry doesn't get hurt in 2016 playoffs, he would have had one of the best postseason runs of all time(not saying that's why Dubs lost vs Cavs please don't assume that), he had 20 odd points before getting hurt in game 1 vs Rockets, then obviously slipped in game 4 vs Rockets. He may be a better player now, but boy that was a show to see every night that unanimous MVP year"
They get a shit ton of money from clubs though.  Salaries:  Messi: 84$ million  Neymar: 73$ million  Ronaldo: 61$ million  Stephen Curry: 34.9$ million  Lebron: 33.5$ million  Check the Forbes link someone posted above. 
"Stephen Jackson was suspended for the first 7 games of that season, and the team started 0-7.   In the final game of the season, Baron Davis got benched for the entire second half by then coach Don Nelson.  This led to Baron leaving, Jackson wanting out, and the team having a bad season the following year. They end up drafting Curry, and the rest is history. "
He has 3 rings dude. What more do you want him to prove? Fmvp is meaningless. You seriously think guys like Andre Iguodola and Kawhi Leonard have proven more than Stephen Curry because of one 1 trophy?
"Murray's stats draw an alarming number of parallels to a then-unknown point guard in 2010, also picked seventh overall. Both were high-level, but not elite, scorers who lacked high-level playmaking ability. The man I am talking about is a young Stephen Curry.   Meanwhile, Ball projects to be a Jason Kidd-type player at his best. Who would you rather have? Stephen Curry or Jason Kidd?"

No one would believe you if you went back in time and told them that LBJ would go back to CLE, lose to the Warriors in the finals because his star teammates were injured but got 2 games on one of the greatest teams of all time (led by some other kid from Akron) with a sophomore from Australia as his 2nd best player, then come back from down 3-1 in the finals against the winningest team of all time to break a 52 year championship drought for his home town, and go from being the most hated villain to one of the most beloved heroes. He also leaves to join the Lakers too. And CLE still loves him.

"It's important because it shows just how high level of players Lebron, Wade, and Bosh were when they joined up.  It would be the equivalent of James Harden, Stephen Curry, and Anthony Davis joining up together in free agency this summer.  The point is that Miami was an absurd combination of talent, and it's stupid that people are downplaying now how absurd it was at the time."
"There once was a man from down under  Who tore Stephen curry asunder.   He dove on the floor  And the crowd, it did roar  And Marv Albert just blathered in wonder "
Monta Ellis and Stephen Curry
"Stephen Curry - in terms of talent/skill set now Damian Lillard but in terms of play style Trae Young  Klay Thompson - less versatile Paul George. Both are essentially elite 3 and D players that can get buckets in a pinch (Paul George more so than Klay, he’s also a better distributor)  Kevin Durant - A smaller/slightly less athletically gifted Anthony Davis with a near automatic jumper (both essentially big men bodies with a guard skill set)  Draymond Green - Ben Simmons. Both serve as primary facilitators for the team. Ben Simmons is a better passer and much more athletic but Draymond is a much better defender (although Simmons has the potential to serve the Draymond role on defense)   DeMarcus Cousins - Deandre Ayton. Obviously Cousins is better and more established right now but both are freaks of nature with an enormous amount of strength and a surprising amount of quickness. Both aren’t the most natural defenders but have the athleticism to. DeMarcus is also a better facilitator and is comfortable orchestrating the break  Sorry if these weren’t that great. Most stars have their own unique skill set and body type and it’s rare to find someone of the same pedigree and skill set with the same body type"
Answereth Stephen Curry from thee three point range.
"No it doesn't.   It has to do with skill level and athleticism. The NBA's skill level far exceeds that of the WNBA, and the NBA's athleticism is in another galaxy compared to the WNBA. TJ McConnell would probably be the best dunker in the WNBA.  **Who is more exciting to watch:**  Diana Taurasi OR Stephen Curry?  Maya Moore OR Lebron James?  Candace Parker OR Kevin Durant?  Sylvia Fowles OR Joel Embiid?  Brittney Griner OR Anthony Davis?"

"From 3 point range. But contrary to contemporary opinion, there are other skills important in basketball outside the Stephen Curry line. "
"&gt;LeBron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, Harden, Davis, Westbrook, Giannis, Embiid, Irving, Hayward CP3, Draymond, Aldridge, Lillard, Butler, Oladipo, Simmons, PG-13, Gobert, Hayward, Cousins, Horford, Wall, KAT, Klay, Conley, Beal, Jokic, and Holiday, just off the top of my head. (This is in no particular order.)  Are you kidding me? I won't take Simmons, Gobert, Oladipo, Horford, Wall, KAT, LMA, Klay, Hayward, Conley, Beal, Jokic, Holiday over Lowry. Lillard and PG are debatable. You are just listing names lmao, Lowry is one of the best volume shooters of all-time when it's all said and done, hitting 42% from three on 8 attempts per game is ludicrous, in 2016 he would've past the all-time three record if it weren't for Stephen Curry.   What has Simmons proved to be better than Lowry? Lowry is better at everything but rebounding and Ben Simmons is 6'10 compared to Lowry being 6'0. I strongly disagree with Simmons, Conley, Horford, Jokic, Holiday, Beal (especially when he out-performed **him in the playoffs**).  I can debate this all day if you want. Lowry is a top 15 player because of his efficiency, volume, rebounding for his size, his playmaking and vision on the court, scoring, shooting, IQ, etc. He's truly a great ball player when healthy he can do extremely well, see his playoff performance... If he had the ball more (than Demar) they would have a chance against the Cavs."
"The guys you named (Kidd, Nash &amp; Billups) were all traditional point guards. And the other guys you named (Westbrook, Curry and Lillard) are scorers first like Allen Iverson was. The role of primary ball handlers has sky rocketed because the skill level and ability to impact the game has increased. Allen Iverson was quoted saying Steph Curry and Kyrie Irving have better handles than him. (Source) https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2465203-allen-iverson-says-stephen-curry-and-kyrie-irving-have-better-handles-than-him   So if Iverson could shake himself loose from hand checking defenders I'm sure Curry, Kyrie, Westbrook and Lillard could as well.   Curry has averaged 25+ in the playoffs 4 years straight. The impact or lack there of narrative is overblown. (Source) https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html  Westbrook doesn't have the highest basketball IQ and it shows in crucial moments. Which is why Durant left.   Lillard has no help aside from McCollum. He has ALWAYS played well in the playoff aside from this latest run. Jrue Holiday and Rajon Rondo are good defenders not to mention Anthony Davis protecting the rim.   I agree wings tend to dominate the playoffs but that's because they are most likely to impact the game in the multiple ways. Bigs don't handle the ball and can't guard a point guard. Wings can. Point guards aren't great rebounders and can't guard 3,4, or 5. A long athletic wing can make it tough for damn near any position unless there's a huge size disadvantage. "
"Why? Why not get Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond green, and add them to their already really solid roster?"
"What are you talking about? Lebron James Jr. is a hybrig of Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving, and Dwyane Wade. I would be shocked if he's not the GOAT when it's all said and done. "
Btw. 1 quick look and here's what i found.  TS%  Lebron james: .541 TS% 2011 Stephen Curry: .580 TS% 2016  There goes that shooting percentage... Oh boy... Guess Lebron got the worst choke of all time. Wouldn't shoot and couldn't make it efficently.

"It's part bad luck, but they've also been notoriously awful at drafting/scouting.  They've drafted 18 players over the last decade. Only 8 are still in the league.  Corey Brewer at 7, when Joakim Noah went at 9.  Wesley Johnson at 4, when Boogie went at 5.  Derick Williams at 2, with like a 5 future allstar's and 2 dozen solid starters still on the board including (ironically) Jimmy Butler.  Pekovic at 31, when DeAndre Jordon went 35. (This one isn't so bad, because at least it's second rounders.)  And of course Rubio and Flynn at 5 and 6 respectively with one Stephen Curry sitting pretty at 7, not to mention DeRozan at 9."
"BT Sport is set to lose the broadcast rights to the popular UFC “ultimate fighting” and NBA basketball after walking away from the bidding amid spiralling costs.  Marc Allera, head of BT Consumer, said that the strategy for BT Sport has matured from having an “emotionally driven start-up mentality” when it launched five years ago to a more clinical assessment of the value it derives from each sport.  “It’s like a big football club in the transfer window. If a striker is worth £50m I won’t pay £70m for him,” he said. “At the wrong price, everything is expendable,” he said of future rights auctions and its commitment to exclusive content.  Walking away from UFC and the NBA comes weeks after Eleven Sports outbid the company for the rights to Italian Serie A football games and represents a further shift for BT to concentrate only on its most valuable rights.  BT Sport was launched with great fanfare five years ago when the telecoms company went head-to-head with Sky in the pay-TV market. The move was seen as both a growth driver and a way of defending its broadband base from rivals by offering free sport.  Yet BT Sport is no longer considered a “core” element of the telecoms company’s consumer offering, according to senior executives within the company, with more effort and resource devoted to improving its network and customer service.  BT, which is now spending £1bn a year on content rights, has since moved to charge for the channels and this year locked in the most important rights — exclusive Champions League and Premier League games — for three more years. But it has started to let more peripheral content go as the cost of the rights has continued to rise.  Investors in BT have complained about the opaque nature of the company’s sports strategy and whether it generates value. Mr Allera said that the direct and indirect revenue generated by its sports channels does cover its costs but that he plans to improve that return by pushing its sport into new areas including smartphone and smart TV deals.  Eleven is owned by Italian businessman Andrea Radrizzani, who controls Leeds United football club. It won the rights to Spanish football in May after outbidding Sky and added Dutch, Swedish and Chinese football rights to its slate in July.  It has secured UFC, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation, but it is unclear whether Eleven will also take the NBA now BT has walked away. It hopes to launch its own streaming service but also to sell the sports rights to companies including BT and Virgin Media, who it has approached in recent months over deals.  UFC was one of BT’s biggest draws on its channels as the sport has grown in popularity during the past five years. The NBA has also provided a useful channel filler given the number of games that are played and it has brought global superstars including LeBron James and Stephen Curry to BT’s screens.  Mr Allera dismissed concerns that the loss of Serie A, UFC and NBA would leave a hole in its schedule. He said that 90 to 95 per cent of its viewing comes from the rights it still has including the Premier League, Champions League, boxing and rugby union. "

"The reason I have Steph out of my top 5 is 1 main reason. If his shot if off he has to lean on other players. In my opinion Steph wouldn't be who he is without Kevin Durant. I know people call KD a snake and all. But really, KD made the warriors the team they are now.   And on the Kawhi thing. I do agree, it's hard to rank him without seeing him play. But we have to consider how good he was before the injury (which is most likely fully healed). I think the only reason Kawhi gets disrespected in this regard is because he was playing in a small market, as opposed to Stephen Curry."

To say KAT's offense is good is also an understatement. KAT was 2nd in the league among 15+ PPG scorers in TS% behind just Stephen Curry. He rebounded at an elite rate and wasn't as garbage on the defensive end as Jokic was.

"Maybe because he's teammates with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green?"
"It’ll be easier for you to get into 2019 basketball and as the season starts, let the details come in. I’ll give u a quick rundown of who’s who in the NBA and a brief backstory.   Lebron James: One of the best if not the best conditioned players in the NBA, never gets injured and is on a 7/8 year streak of going to the finals.  Stephen Curry: Revolutionized the game by shooting three point shots at a high ass rate, extremely popular with the kids because u can relate to him being short and not a super athlete.  Kevin Durant: great player for the warriors who Steph also plays for, he left his hometown team to join them after they beat him in the playoffs after they got the best regular season record of all time.  Demarcus Cousins: another stud who joined the warriors this year. He got traded from his hometown team 2 years ago, went to a franchise with another top 3 big man and they did pretty okay. He tore his Achilles and took a large large large paycut to play for the warriors for one season so he could rehab appropriately and get a ring.  Kyrie Irving: used to play with Lebron, requested a trade to lead his own franchise, got traded to the Celtics for their star player. Has one of the best handles of all time, Celtics have great coach and would be clear favorites if the warriors weren’t at an all time level.  James Harden and Russell Westbrook: Triple double machines, they have taken the last 2 MVPs and a lot of people are now questioning the significance of getting at least 10 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in one game. Top tier players Kawhi Leonard: forced a trade out of his hometown team but didn’t say anything about anything to anyone and this made people mad, plays for now top 3 team in the east The 76ers: controversial team because they have young stars this season and they purposely lost games to make sure they got good young players. Fun team to watch though.  No bias here tho: watch the Celtics for a fun ride tho  There’s ur players who I think will be important to the storyline for the nba season"
"If you want to understand Stephen Curry, who’s the best PG in the league right now and is widely considered to be a top 3 player as well, watch this video: https://youtu.be/quI--kovXgI It’s his most famous game and is truly awesome"
"*League itself*: **Oscar Robertson**, for suing the NBA and allowing free agency to be brought to the league.   Before that, the NBA basically bound players to their respective teams unless a trade happened or the team no longer wanted a player. There would be no player movement and arguably no chance for players to really judge their worth/compete for higher offers without him.  *Basketball itself*: Lots of people, but in more recent times **Stephen Curry** because of just how ridiculous his shooting is.  Before, you certainly had three-point specialists who were elite at off-ball movement, like Reggie Miller and Ray Allen. You also had great players who were just super fucking efficient at all-around scoring, like Dirk and KD.  Steph was already supposed to be a good all-around scoring point guard, but once he figured out he could launch 8-10 threes a game AND make them at the same rate a lot of players would make midrange shots he became game-breaking.   For the Warriors, his shooting opened up the floor a LOT more due to players having to run around more on defense (vs. clog the paint defending midrange and layups). Offenses across the league changed in response to seeing how well the Warriors were doing with three-point shooting, with teams taking way more threes a game than at any point in history. Subsequently, what's known as a ""good defense"" changed, too -- instead of just having to have a good rim protector, teams now need switchable, long perimeter defenders, lest a three is given up."
"I’m not comparing the League MVP to a role guy? I’m comparing All-NBA defense (with virtually no offense vs. All-NBA 1st Guy (who virtually plays no defense). You’re literally proving my point. An elite offensive player is your MVP. An elite defense player is a role guy.  I can get downvotes all day, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s true. Stephen Curry? Extreme offensive talent, mediocre defense. John Wall, elite defensively and pretty good offensively. Who are you taking? [MDJ has a great video explaining this](https://youtu.be/eKLCiUkAFmk) and debunking this phenomenon. LeBron was the best player in the world last year because of his offense, not his defense. Kawhi Leonard became a superstar talent because of offense. There is no chance that you would take Ben Wallace over KAT today, much less in his prime. I’ll take Nikola Jokic over Gobert any day of the week. The better players are the ones who are better offensively. It’s quite simple if you really break it down. Obviously defense is important but it’s more like a 65/35 split.   Edit: A better comparison could be Draymond Green vs. James Harden or Russell Westbrook. Both parties are dominant at their side of the ball, who would you consider the better player?"
"When they get married, who will take who's name? Kyrie Curry? Stephen Irving?"
"KD as a matter-of-fact joined a team that won 73 games in the regular season, the greatest regular season record. He also joined the first ever league unanimous MVP, which is also a fact. He joined 2 other All-Stars in Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, which is also a fact.  That team 'choked' because of various factors with Draymond's suspension but also LeBron and Kyrie going supernova was a huge deal. I cannot stress how great LeBron was in that Finals, and Kyrie matched him stride for stride offensively the whole way.  The Cavs regressed after that Finals (back to the mean I should say because Cavs Game 5-7 was not their normal standard), however Warriors won the Finals just the year before. Durant didn't give them a 'killer instinct', he just skewed the odds to where even one or two of their All Stars shying away meant they could win.  You ask yourself, who will win the NBA Finals this year? If the answer isn't Warriors, you're lying to yourself. It's a foregone conclusion and I don't think the NBA has been that in a long time. I'm sorry, but some team being able to line up with 5 All-NBA players is a bit fucking sad and dismal as a fan of another team, no matter the circumstances.  Warriors with Curry, Barnes, Draymond, and Klay were an organic beast who you cannot begrudge their success to; you still can't begrudge the Warriors, but I sure as hell can begrudge Kevin Durant's success. Just because he's the best player on an already stacked team doesn't say much - we've always known his immense talent. It's just, how is it a challenge when if you have an off-night you have Stephen motherfucking Curry as your second option..."
Fucking Stephen Curry man
Haha what? Define prime Monta Ellis for me please. We’re talking the Ellis that played with Stephen Curry? The Ellis with Jennings? The Ellis on the Mavs? 
"&gt; he just can't stay healthy  I don't think OP meant he worked on *those* parts of his Stephen Curry game, but we'll just have to hope Blake put in some LBJ work too."
"Which is why dont understand why any self respecting human could be a warriors fan. That team is cheating as fuck and we all know it. DeMarcus Cousins taking a 2 mil deal for what? A ring? That's super weak. I hate Stephen Curry but I'll give him his props. He got his first ring by working hard and staying loyal. Once KD joined though...yea his credibility is in the garbage can.  Edit: surprise, surprise. People like the taste of a winning team in their mouths. I'm not replying to anymore comments. Having a team who's starting 5 are all superstars is unsportsmanlike. Especially when they have been acquired soon after championship wins. Warriors are lame and the bandwagon fans are even lamer. Thank you in advance for your downvotes."

Stephen Curry 
"""stephen curry like 3's"" lmaooo"
"Lionel Messi is Stephen Curry (both playstyles are magic, Messi's 2012 year = Curry's 2016 year)  and Christiano Ronaldo is Lebron James (Both are ""machine"" like, both are jacked for their respective sports, etc.)"
"Thank you.   That Stephen thing is a joke. I think 99% of the people realized that too. At current trajectory, he's probably going to go down as an ""era"" level player (Russell/Kareem/Magic+Bird/Jordan/Kobe+Duncan/LBJ) which is near that ""GOAT"" conversation level.  I'm 1000% team Bron, but I still love Stephen Curry the human being and respect his game. You gotta be some real monster or hater to hate that man."
"I'd disagree. Wholeheartedly. Otherwise you wouldn't have Stephen Curry so obviously the greatest shooter ever over guys that also practiced millions of times to be some of the greatest shooters ever. Ray Allen and Reggie Miller....JJ Redick and Kyle Korver, Drazen Petrovich and Larry Bird, Klay Thompson.....you don't think Curry has ANY natural shooting talent that helped him there? Or you just think he somehow is also the hardest working shooter out of all of those guys...?    His natural shooting talents are his hand eye coordination, and the flexibility in his wrist and arms. And just his natural sense of balance and touch. Things that don't come natural to Russel Westbrook. Things that can be trained....yes. Just like athleticism. But things that have a personal limit as well....just like athleticism. No matter how hard Russell Westbrook trained for his shot he would never be a good as Curry. I'm not CONFLATING anything. You are IGNORING Curry's natural talent that he has taken advantage of. And you are basically saying ANYONE could be as good as Stephen if they practiced the same amount. Which is obviously not true as I just gave you examples of the greatest shooters to ever play...one his teammate.....a guy who practices with him every day for years now....still not being close to as good.   Edit: You aren't completely wrong....you are just trying to waaayy oversimplify things. "
"He's a more skilled scorer, he's a more efficient scorer, a better passer, and a better defender. The margins between the two in these categories is massive.  DeRozan had a 114 offensive rating to Wiggins' 101. DeRozan had a 109 defensive rating to Wiggins' 113. DeRozan had a BPM of +1.8, Wiggins had a BPM of -2.5. DeRozan had .170 WS/48, Wiggins had .034 WS/48.  Derozan was 67th in the NBA in Real Plus Minus, at +1.66. Wiggins was 322nd in RPM at -1.62.  Speaking of RPM, Jimmy Butler was 4th in the league, behind Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, and James Harden. KAT was 16th.  If you divide RPM ranking up and distribute players evenly throughout the league, Wiggins would considered to be a bottom tier 11th man.   Andrew Wiggins just isn't good at basketball and is a massive negative on both the offensive and defensive ends. He plays like he's a star from the early 2000s, but he's not even as efficient as those guys were."

Lebron James missed his first ~20 shots guarded by Stephen Curry in the 2018 finals.
"The thing here is, the number 1 players for each position (for me) more or less need the ball to be effective.  That’s why I would go a more team-oriented lineup:  PG Stephen Curry  SG MJ  SF Scottie Pippen  PF Lebron  C Dennis Rodman  Would play 4 out 1 in of course, while both MJ and LeBron could take their guy to the post as well. All of these players are great players both ways, while Rodman even handled Shaq to a good extent.  Small ball is in anyways ;)"

"Agreed. Steph’ll never reach those heights. No pun intended, Stephen Curry."
"Eric Gordon is a reserve player on the Houston Rockets. KD is a starter, why would you argue this?  Losing Iguodala is losing the fifth best player on the team. You cannot say that Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant all suffered losses because of one player missing time. Even if one of the all stars was missing, them losing games is still not excused. It's a championship caliber team still.  Your example is completely different because Chris Paul is an all star caliber player and Andre Iguodala is not. The Rockets also possess only two all star caliber players as opposed to the Warriors' four.  Not sure why you had to attack my flair and call me delusional when my opinion is not even that controversial."

"Fine. The dudes younger than Winslow, averages 25ppg, is efficient, has the tools to become an acceptable defender, can pull up and score from anywhere in the half court while being able to run the pick and roll and apparently all Winslow has to do is ""become a decent scorer"" and he's better than Booker. You somehow think that's more likely than Booker improving enough to play on a winning team.You know who else sucks at defense? James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Stephen Curry.

"When his career is finally over, maybe then will the fandom finally appreciate how unique Stephen Curry is. This is only possible because his ego doesn't manifest itself the way everyone else's does."
"I thought this would be a fun chance for me to look at teams/players that I haven't seen that much of. Did my best but I don't catch as many games as is really needed to do this well. Also any player that was/is injury for a significant time I will judge as if they will be back to full strength. So Hayward will get a pass for the games this year as it has been too short to truly judge him yet. I will also exclude rookies for the top ten. Anyways here's my list:  PG:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Russell Westbrook 3. Chris Paul 4. Damian Lillard 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Kyle Lowry 7. John Wall 8. Ben Simmons 9. Kemba Walker 10. Mike Conley  This is the deepest position for elite talent; for me 4 through 10 are pretty close but there is a good drop to 11, etc. I have Rubio, Dragic, and Bledsoe as the next three. As a note (and this will probably be disregarded due to flair), I think you overrate Lonzo, there are probably 15-20 players I would have above him right now, and it might be more depending on his minutes this year. Not to say he won't end up top ten (he easily could be top ten with an average shot), but right now he is not that close. I'm pretty excited by last year's pg class and think some of them will end up in this top ten in the next couple years (hope one of them is Fox).  &amp;#x200B;  SG:  1. James Harden 2. Jimmy Butler 3. Klay Thompson 4. DeMar DeRozan 5. Victor Oladipo 6. Bradley Beal 7. Jrue Holiday 8. CJ McCollum 9. Donovan Mitchell 10. Devin Booker  I thought this was going to be a weak position group but there are a ton of good SG's right now that make up for the lack of elite SG's. I had Jaylen Brown as a SG and he just missed the cut. He is probably top ten if you put him at SF (Bball ref has him 51/45% SG/SF last year). A couple others were hard to leave out: Lou Williams, Gary Harris, Will Barton, Brown, Tyreek Evans, and JJ Redick were all right there for me. I also think this position will have some up and comers this year. Zach LaVine, Josh Richardson, Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Josh Hart, and Tim Hardaway Jr are all very good young players at this position.  &amp;#x200B;  SF:  1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Paul George 5. Gordon Hayward 6. Khris Middleton 7. Otto Porter Jr 8. Jayson Tatum 9. Joe Ingles 10. Harrison Barnes  This position has the most top end talent but is relatively shallow after the top guys. My next five were Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Taurean Prince, Brandon Ingram, Robert Covington and Andrew Wiggins. I think Barnes is underrated due to being on a bad team, but I expect he will be outside the top 10 for Prince or Ingram by the end of the year. I have Giannis as a PF.   &amp;#x200B;  PF  1. Anthony Davis 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. LaMarcus Aldridge 4. Draymond Green 5. Kevin Love 6. Blake Griffin 7. Kristaps Porzingis 8. Derrick Favors 9. Nikola Mirotic 10. Tobias Harris  This is the weakest position for me. My next three would be Paul Millsap, Aaron Gordon, and Dario Saric. I feel like I might be missing someone here because that group in just not that good. Millsap two years ago would easily make the top 10 but he slowed down last year. Not sure who else deserve consideration.  &amp;#x200B;  C  1. Joel Embiid 2. Nikola Jokic 3. DeMarcus Cousins 4. Rudy Gobert 5. Karl-Anthony Towns 6. Al Horford 7. Andre Drummond 8. Clint Capela 9. Steven Adams 10. Marc Gasol  Another group that was deeper than I thought. My next four would be Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, Jusuf Nurkic, and Hassan Whiteside. Lots of potential here for some young guys. I think particularly Jarrett Allen and Deandre Ayton have a chance at top ten by the end of the year.   &amp;#x200B;  Let me know why this entirely too long post is wrong!  &amp;#x200B;"

"&gt; WS/48 is heavily influenced by the quality of your team and tells you very little about how players stack up (or anything at all for that matter). LeBron tends to lead Jordan in many of the +/- based stats, aka the ones that aren't just box score approximations and actually tell you something about a player's impact.  You have it backwards. While not perfect, WS/48 is the best metric to measure individual impact. +/- are much more dependent on your team/lineups.  &gt; LeBron has had several non-MVP seasons clearly better than Jordan's '98 MVP season. Unfortunately his competition was Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Stephen Curry all at their peaks instead of 36 year old Karl Malone. And this goes without mentioning the '11 Rose robbery.  You fail to realize that Jordan was also robbed of MVPs. And bringing up 2011 is just dumb, even LeBron himself said Rose was the MVP that year. Rose had a worse team, and both of his starting bigmen combined to miss 60 games, and he still dragged the Bulls to a better record than LeBron's Heat. LeBron wasn't evn second in MVP voting that year so its not like he was going to win if Rose didn't anyways.  &gt; I don't think LeBron deserved a DPOY either but '09 has a better case than any of Jordan's years as far as I'm concerned.   Lmao. You write off Jordan's DPOY by saying a perimeter defender wasn't as impactful as one of the best interior defenders ever, and then say that LeBron deserved DPOY over Dwight?? Who at the time ran off like 4 straight DPOYs and in his prime was one of the best interior defenders we have ever seen???  "
"PER was literally designed by Hollinger to put Jordan at the top. He arbitrarily assigned values to box score measures to create a ranking that fit his liking.

LeBron tends to lead Jordan in many of the +/- based stats, aka the ones that aren't just box score approximations and actually tell you something about a player's impact.  And here's the thing regarding accolades and awards: they're 100% relative. Ranking players by media voted and circumstantial awards is a lazy way of doing things and cuts out all the context and critical thinking. Let me break all these down for you:  1. Steals and scoring titles are completely meaningless. They just tell you who averaged the most ppg and spg in a season. Allen Iverson has more scoring and steals titles than LeBron but you'd be pretty stupid to put him above LeBron as a scorer or a defender. A player could theoretically average the second most points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks and not win a single award for it despite being by far the best player in the league. LeBron's thing isn't that he's the clear best at one particular facet of the game, it's that he's top 3-5 in a lot of different areas. Unfortunately for him there is no ""all-around"" award given out at the end of the year.  2. LeBron has had several non-MVP seasons clearly better than Jordan's '98 MVP season. Unfortunately his competition was Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Stephen Curry all at their peaks instead of 36 year old Karl Malone. And this goes without mentioning the '11 Rose robbery.   3. I'll probably get heat for this but it's 100% true. That DPOY Jordan won was Hakeem's. You can't tell me an elite guard defender is more valuable defensively than arguably the greatest defender of all time in the middle of his athletic prime. If you suggest otherwise you simply don't understand how basketball works. Although Jordan was undoubtedly great defensively that season, by far the biggest reason the Bulls were a good defensive team that year was because they led the league in DRB% by an enormous margin. Soon as they traded Oakley in '89, they crashed from #3 to below average.  I don't think LeBron deserved a DPOY either but '09 has a better case than any of Jordan's years as far as I'm concerned. 09 Cavs with LeBron had a 100.6 DRtg (-7.7) while the Magic with DPOY Howard had a 101.8 DRtg (-6.5) Cavs overall were only the 3rd best defense at -5.9 because they fell off a cliff without LeBron (below average defense at +0.5). In comparison, the 88 Bulls were also 3rd best defense but at only -2.5 against an almost identical league average DRtg.  LeBron led the Cavs in every defensive statistic: defensive rebounds, total rebounds, steals, blocks and defensive on-off. He ranked 2nd in DRAPM among perimeter players behind Artest, 2nd in opponent PER among perimeter players behind Kirilenko (while playing considerably more minutes than either) and the Cavs were first at the SF position in points and efficiency allowed."

"I have a legit question... Who do you think had a bigger impact on basketball this generation, LeBron James or Stephen Curry? I find it so interesting that LeBron is seen as being so much better than Curry, but Curry changed the landscape more than any athlete since Shaq.   Edit: I'm in my 30s. I watched Jordan and then Shaq and now James. Steph Curry is a goddamn enigma. He's the fucking Jeff Hardy of basketball. "

"The thing about advanced stats is, you have to use your brain too. They're not gonna tell you the whole picture. Rudy Gobert is a guy that mainly gets assisted dunks and putbacks, which is great, but you don't wanna compare him to Stephen Curry or any other guy that creates his own looks from the perimeter. That's really just common sense though.   You can use it to compare apples to apples, for example if two players score roughly the same amount of points but one guy is a 62% TS and the other is a 54% TS, then you know whos the better scorer overall pretty easily."

"Actually Kerr put him in this conversation.  Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr isn't playing favorites, but he also isn't shy about naming the best player on his stacked title squad.  &amp;#x200B;  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  &amp;#x200B;  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  &amp;#x200B;  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  &amp;#x200B;  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game.""  &amp;#x200B;  The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible.  &amp;#x200B;  ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said.  &amp;#x200B;  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  &amp;#x200B;  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  &amp;#x200B;  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""

Even if tomorrow there's a 6'9'' Chinese Basketball player that becomes better than him it wouldn't mean that skills and hard work are more important than height.   The best Basketball player is Lebron, he is 6'8'', maybe just 0.1% of the population is taller than 6'7''.   Kevin Durant is 7 foot tall and he is the second best NBA player.  Stephen Curry is 6'3'' (very tall), he is, by far, the most skilled NBA player and one the hardest workers and it's hard to say that he is the 3rd best Basketball player, there are other guys who are better than him but are playing for shitty teams.   &gt; Because there are hundreds of millions of basketball fans and most of them are NOT NBA HEIGHT.   I'm just saying that people tend to like meritocracies in sports, which is why Basketball will always be far away from being the most popular sport in the world.   &gt; Giving you 3 names literally isn't even relevant to the argument.  Yeah, it's irrelevant because you cannot even answer such an easy question about a sport that according to you is about skills and hard work and not about being tall. "
"First of all, ex players spit out dumb hot takes all the time. Steve Kerr said Stephen Curry is more impactful than MJ, that doesn't make it true.  Second of all, that's bullshit, neither of them have ever said that. "
PG - Stephen Curry SG - Tracy McGrady SF - Carmelo Anthony PF - Kristaps Porzingis C - Dwight Howard
Just putting all my favorite players in the team.  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Kobe Bryant  SF: Klay Thompson  PF: Kristaps Porzingis  C: Joel Embiid
Stephen Curry/Manu Ginobili/LeBron James/Tim Duncan/Joel Embiid
"Curry and Durant would be two of the favorites, but cancel each other out in theory. James Harden is unlikely to have the best stats, and guys rarely win it back to back. Chris Paul probably isn't MVP worthy. Celtics are very balanced, and Kyrie Irving is unlikely to have MVP stats that put him over guys like Curry.   From there, we end up with:  * Kawhi Leonard * Joel Embiid * Giannis Antekoumpo  One of these players will probably be on the 1st or 2nd seed in the conference. So if they go traditional, whichever one of those guys ends up on a 1 or 2 seed, possibly even 3 seed if they win 55+ games will probably get it. My money would be on Giannis in this scenario.  I think Lebron is a decent bet. He would get it as the 3rd seed imo with mid 50's wins. The media wants to give it to him, but the question of whether the Lakers are good enough remains. I agree that Davis' team isn't good enough to get him in the conversation.  Some dark horses would be Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo, and Paul George (if he keeps them good while Westbrook is out), but most of these players generally fall short of the stats you expect from MVP.  The problem is that Curry/Durant would be the traditional MVP winners, but they're on the same team.   My bets would be placed in this order:  1. Giannis Antekoumpo 2. Lebron James 3. Stephen Curry 4. Kevin Durant 5. Kawhi Leonard"

Wardell Stephen Curry II  Kevin Wayne Durant
Maybe Stephen curry literally dies and the warriors have to do a weekend at Bernie’s type thing for the entire season. 
"Durant has played with one of Harden, Westbrook, or Stephen Curry every year he’s played the playoffs.   Lebron played with either Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love in the years Butler has been in the league  I’m sure if the Bulls teams had prime Wade/Bosh, Kyrie/Love, Westbrook, or Stephen Curry, Jimmy would have been able to win a lot more on those Chicago teams.

"It's not close. JRich is really good, but out of guards it's really only Roberson and Beverley who match Smart.   Smart consistently locks down star players in big moments:   * Vs Wizards - 2017 ECSF: [*Coach Brad Stevens had pulled Thomas, who was being repeatedly picked on by the Wizards offense, and plugged in Smart, who stayed on the floor for the remainder of the game.

"LeBron ""Stephen Curry"" James"
In all fairness the defender was sagging and had his hands down. Trae Youngs NBA comparison is Stephen Curry. It's also preseason. 
I drove five hours to see Stephen Curry play in college before he got big - he ended up having a career.  Not so much for Sebastian Telfair. 
"Stephen Curry on Ayesha Curry texting him about her feet: ""Hell yes. That was true. All true. 100 percent true. She talked specifically about all of that stuff."""
"Obviously you didn’t watch much “D” league if you think that Derrick white has a place there.  He literally looked like Stephen curry there.   No one could guard him, and no one could outscore him.  He won’t be worse than an average role player like mills for sure."
"Steph Curry  &amp;#x200B;  Mike Breen:  they do have a time out, they decide not to use it. Curry way downtown! BANG!! BANG!! OHHH!! What a shot from CURRY!! with six tenths of a second remaining the brilliant shooting of Stephen Curry continues "
"I ran it again using total statistics. The problem is I’m using current year RPM and since Hayward and Kawhi played so few games, their RPM in the formula is incredibly low.  Using total games played to allow for players to play on two teams, the top ten are:   Stephen Curry  Chris Paul  Jimmy Butler  DeMarcus Cousins  Tyreke Evans  Rudy Gobert  Joel Embiid  Nene Hilario  Kristaps Porzingis  Nikola Mirotic   Edit: I don’t have a lot of time or knowledge to make this better, but I did (82-G)*AVERAGE(2018RPM,2017RPM) and got this:   Kawhi Leonard  Stephen Curry  Chris Paul  Jimmy Butler  DeMarcus Cousins  Paul Millsap  Rudy Gobert  Mike Conley  Kevin Love  **Lucas Nogueira**"
"(82-GP)*RPM (or another stat)  Doing so for 2018 gives the following 13 players:  Stephen Curry Chris Paul Jimmy Butler DeMarcus Cousins Tyreke Evans Rudy Gobert Joel Embiid Kristaps Porzingis Nene Hilario Kevin Love Andre Roberson Jordan Bell Paul Millsap  Not including any players who played on more than one team."
My Top 10 heading into the season  1. LeBron James 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kevin Durant 4. Stephen Curry 5. James Harden 6. Russell Westbrook 7. Giannis Antetokounmpo 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Chris Paul 10. Kyrie Irving  &amp;#x200B;
"It usually is, but Westbrook imo is an outlier in this case.   As much as he's responsible for getting his team to dubs, he makes some VERY boneheaded plays sometimes where I'm left scratching my head. Stats don't tell the whole story, and I think that's why [GM's voted Steph as the league's best point.](https://bluemanhoop.com/2018/10/07/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-point-guard/) A lot of what Steph is doing doesn't show up on stat sheets and it's all these little things that Westbrook imo lacks. Don't get me wrong though, he's 100% still a top 6-10 player in the league, but Steph's effect on the game is absolutely insane whether or not he's holding the ball or getting numbers."

"In NBA there is no 'double dribble' call for one. Second, I have no idea what you mean by 'you travel with your feet'. A travel is initiated when a player ends his dribble and takes greater than 2.5 (.5 being the gather) steps following the end of the dribble.   There are many ways to end a dribble, in this case, the dribble would have ended prematurely had Stephen Curry touched the ball with both hands. After having done so, driving to the basket would constitute the travel.   If you are merely dribbling the ball, you can throw it halfway down the court, chase it with 10 steps, and continue dribbling with no penalty. "
"Well, in Wolves defense Curry refused to do workouts with Wolves and Currys agent told to not draft him.

Also only casuals think that there is a massive skill gap between Curry and Kyrie. Curry is older and has a great system that he thrives in. Half of his success is do to Steve Kerr. Before Kerrs system curry was a 22 ppg player. Kyrie does almost everything better except for shooting 3s. If 2 players average around the same ppg but one if them gets most of his point from the 10+ 3s he shoots per game, they other player is probably the better scorer.  By your opinion  and your examples, I can tell that ironically you are a casual.. "
"Fox, Dlo are not going to be top 5 for various reasons.  &amp;#x200B;  Simmons and Ball could be because of their court vision. Irving could still be because of his excellent shooting, ballhandling.  Lillard will still be in his prime, Kemba Walker will be relevant still, Stephen Curry might still be the best.  &amp;#x200B;  Fox, Smith not buying these - too little feel how to run a smooth offense. They are the type of PG that makes plays for others by being scorers first of all and for that they are not efficient enough or too ball dominant imo.  Dlo seems just way too lackadaisical."

"Hedging is a type of Pick-and-Roll defense when the big man jumps in front of the ball handler before recovering back to their man.  [Watch how Giannis defends Lillard on this play](https://youtu.be/GywONxVisys?t=118) - that is a hedge.  The guard fights through the screen and recovers back to the ball handler after the hedge.  It is the most traditional PnR coverage, I believe OKC mostly uses hedging.  It is good at preventing the ball handler from getting an open shot, but a good passing PG can hit the roll man easily unless the team cheats off the shooters on the weakside.  Drop coverage is when the big man defending the screener just drops towards the rim, staying between the ball handler and the rim.  It is up to the guard to fight through the screen to prevent the ball handler from getting an open shot.  [Watch Brook Lopez on this play as he drops and Kemba makes him pay.](https://youtu.be/Pt8gCBBDHJc?t=178)  In general, dropping is good for protecting the rim and guarding against corner threes.  But hedging is good for stopping the ball handler from using the pick to get an open shot.  Drop coverage is the way to defend Russell Westbrook, but hedging/switching is the way to defend Stephen Curry.  "

"Are you guys stupid. That's Stephen Curry, the point guard for the Warriors. He's actually a better shooter than his brother and a top 3 player in the world. Man what's wrong with this sub sometimes "
Hypothetically can u imagine how salty Westbrook would be if Stephen Curry beat him one on one? 😂😂😂
No. Stephen Curry is the worst player in the nba. Not even worth a vet minimum.                   /s
Stephen curry is a great playmaker but not on the level of cp3. As a scorer he is probably the best point guard ever. Steph doesn’t need to be a pure point guard. 
"Russell Westbrook is that fast and scary with a basketball. Some players get in a groove off a rebound to go score.   Look at Lebron, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry as well. "
"Curry is making 5.9 threes per game. He is, currently, on pace to make ****483**** threes this season.  Ladies and gentlemen, 2016 Curry is back...and he is on fucking steroids.  **Edit***     Fun fact:    2015-16 Stephen Curry shot 51.7% (31-60) on pullup 3s during the first 10 games   2018-19 Stephen Curry is shooting 51.3% (20-39) on pullup 3s after 10 games"
Whether you feel he was healthy or not is up to you. I'm just stating that the Warriors did have major injuries in the playoffs before.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/report-stephen-curry-has-shoulder-issues-to-go-with-his-ankle-knee-problems/  https://www.slamonline.com/archives/stephen-curry-will-play-game-3-uncomfortable-elbow-injury/
"Lol Curry went from being healthy in 2016 to having his ankle, knee, elbow, and shoulder injured. These injuries keep getting more ridiculous.   https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-portland-trail-blazers-injury-return-game-4-050916"
"i know what I said. And I'm not trying to disrespect Nash, he's one of my favorite players ever.   Curry is a great passer, and his impact on his teammates is similar to nash/magic (and better than Kidd or Stockton). Curry's game--at least what makes it so special--is more Nash than Reggie. You want to see a guy purely in the Reggie/Ray mold, look to Klay.  Curry plays the same way Nash did--able to hit from everywhere (off the dribble), able to *get* anywhere with his dribble, he uses his gravity to pull defenses out of position then hit the open man. This is exactly what nash did. Curry doesnt quite have Nash's passing (who does?) but he more than makes up for it by having such insane range that he pulls people out of position way deeper on the court  Curry's teams play with much more space than Durant's. Curry makes the court larger, an insane advantage in a sport where giant men compete in a small area. Curry then darts around this space and finds a pass when the defense springs a leak (just like Nash did).  There's not any PG in the league right now I'd take to run my offense over Curry. His lower assist total has more to do with the warriors system and he regularly leads the league in hockey assists  Curry is on the mount Rushmore of offensive point guards, right there with Magic and Nash. And it's not just because of his scoring (which is also legendary for the position). Curry makes his teammates better more than anyone in the NBA.  [Here's article 538 did in 2017,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/) after one of Curry's less statistically impressive recent seasons, and it still found that noone in the league made their teammates better to the extent Curry does. It wasnt all that close either. Curry makes his teammates better like Magic and Nash while scoring almost as unstoppably as Durant "
"I ran into Stephen Curry’s entourage at my job at Stoneridge Mall 2 years back, and boy was his security guard a dick. I was sitting there on my phone scrolling through reddit, then whoa, theres Steph Curry. Suddenly his security escort gets in my face, telling me to put my phone away.  Like dude, dont come into MY work, telling me to put MY phone away, im not going to go all fan girl paparazzi, even if Curry is one of my favorite athletes.  Sorry, not relevant, but if that was McKinnies cousin then fuck him."

"I said when they hired him and I’ll say it again. I’m not sure how you’re going to find success running an offense based off the idea that Wardell Stephen Curry II is on the floor when you don’t have Wardell Stephen Curry II in your Lineup.   It’s very linear thinking, but if magic ever thinks the Lakers will be successful trying to do what the warriors do. He’s gonna be disappointed.   And maybe I’m biased because as a warriors fan o obviously want to see Luke succeed and seeing him starting the process of being scapegoated isn’t sitting well with me but yea. "
"Stephen Curry is an unbelievable talent, will go down as the best shooter of all time. Klay, when he gets hot, becomes the best player of all time. Durant is just easymoney.   I fucking hate the warriors but damn if they aren't the best NBA team I've ever seen. If they stay together they might win the next 3 years in a row. "
The best Curry is Dell. NBA legend with a legendary NBA player son and his other son Stephen is not bad. No contest until I see Canons jumpshot.

"So [Michael Jordan's 69 point game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199003280CLE.html) would register as 98 (69 + 18 + 6 + 4 + 1)?  Sweet.  For comparison purposes, here are the Game Scores above 30 this season, along with the stats you are tracking, and the Club 60 players in bold.  Game Score is a formula for evaluating productivity in one game:  &gt;Game Score; the formula is PTS + 0.4 \* FG - 0.7 \* FGA - 0.4\*(FTA - FT) + 0.7 \* ORB + 0.3 \* DRB + STL + 0.7 \* AST + 0.7 \* BLK - 0.4 \* PF - TOV.

Is this Stephen Curry of the Goalen State Warriors?
"My point is pretty obvious, those Hall of Famers aren’t Stephen fucking Curry"
This reminds me of a stat I saw a few years ago.   “Stephen Curry joins LeBron James as the only players to record a 25-point double double on their 27th birthday.” #PeakESPN
I mean Stephen Curry is the greatest idk why this is like it.
Stephen Curry won’t be an all-star
Just surround Curry with shooters at every position. They could probably put up 200 per game.   PG - Stephen Curry SG - JJ Redick SF - Joe Ingles PF - Anthony Tolliver C - Al Horford
"Stephen Curry, Akron’s truest son. "
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Kyle Korver, Steve Kerr, Mark Price, Steve Nash are the players I can think of who are better shooters and than you have guys like Gilbert, Michael Redd, Paul Pierce who were all good shooters in their primes. I am forgetting a bunch right now sincenI am studying for my midterms lol. KD is top 15 and arguably top 10."
Michael Jordan never had to play against Stephen fucking Curry
ShotMechanics: How to shoot like Stephen Curry   https://youtu.be/nDMDOZW6rPs
"[This article](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/03/14/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-bruce-fraser-steve-kerr-shot) is from a couple of years ago, but it's a good read on this topic."
"But the ""matchups"" are overstated as I tell you as no PG spends the entire game defending their opposite #, especially the Curry/Draymond PnR, everybody switches that these days.   Riddle me this then, why can't the Warriors score when Stephen Curry is on the bench? This has been true, pretty much every year since Stephen Curry became an All-Star level player, and it's backed by the on/off Offensive Rating #s. Last year, when Curry missed 30 games, the Warriors had plenty of game time without him and with their 3 other All-S, and yet their offensive efficiency in those games would've ranked like 17th in the league, with the supposed ""stacked"" team of Klay and KD.  The dirty secret you're forgetting as to why Curry is so invaluable to these Warriors is that he's the only player on the team who can draw double teams, and is the only elite passer on the team. Without Curry, the Warriors offense devolves into tons of KD ISOs and Klay DHOs which lend itself to a shit ton of KD and Klay mid-range shots, which is not the foundation of an efficient offense, the Warriors assist rate and # of 3s went significantly down without Curry, simple fact is the Warriors can't score without Curry because he is the engine of their offense who creates all the easy looks for everybody else because he is the greatest shooter of all-time and the only player in NBA history who players actually have to go and close out 30 feet from the rim and per the instructions of their coaches, are more scared of him shooting an open 3-pointer than basically any other player taking any other shot on the team.   EDIT: In the 2017 Finals, there's video proof of JR Smith on fast break defense closing out to Steph in the corner who doesn't have the ball, and ignoring KD who goes right down the court for a dunk. That's by design too. Who else has that effect? "
"I can't find a source that confirms that Rose's jersey was a top-10 seller in China in 2017.  The closest thing I can find that even remotely connects Rose to a top-10 seller is this ESPN article, written in 2017, about 2016 jersey sales, which has Rose as a top-10 seller overall on nbastore.com, but not top-10 or top-15 in China.   http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18571714/kobe-bryant-stephen-curry-top-nba-jersey-sales-china   "
"And yet, he's no longer a superstar.  Edited to add: although not conclusive, jersey sales are highly correlated with the popularity of players.  It goes beyond saying that the players who sell the most jerseys are the most popular.  As of 2016, DRose was more popular overall among NBA fans generally than he was among Chinese fans specifically, at least according to jersey sales. http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18571714/kobe-bryant-stephen-curry-top-nba-jersey-sales-china.  Unsurprisingly, he wasn't in the top 5 for 2018.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22124345/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-tops-jersey-sales-china.  This idea that DRose is hella popular there because there have been a few youtube tributes to him by Chinese fans is silly.  He certainly WAS popular there, and remains popular there the way Tony Parker remains popular in the US, despite him being at the end of his career, but he certainly isn't among the most popular.  Anyone who's gone to China in the last few years knows that Steph and Lebron are more popular than Rose.  Among my friends in China who are over 30, their favorite player is more often than not, TMac.  This notion that Rose is a god in China is something I only see here on Reddit, and is not something borne out by the facts or my personal experience.  "

Stephen Curry is the best basketball player in the world right now.
No. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are both playing at an MVP level this season and Curry is probably going to win a unanimous MVP as he scores 30 PPG on 70 TS% this year. The Warriors are also adding Demarcus Cousins in a couple months.  Nothing is stopping the Warriors this season.
Stephen Curry plays NBA basketball like it's a fucking exhibition game
"Stephen Curry retreats to his room each night alone to block out what he can’t handle to shut his eyes.   He intends to leave the latest Furry Basketball Magazine on the desk, to slide it face down to the back corner or hopefully toss into a trash can later, but it comes out face-up, and there’s that smile again.   Soft and inviting even in still-frame.   LeBron has clearly been dressed up for the shoot in his very best furry costume. Steph knows what it is like, familiar with the early morning shoots and never-ending makeup, but the fur on his body’s frame is something... else.  Steph slides the furry basketball magazine off his desk, crosses the floor to his bed, and twists to drop over the sheets, to fall back across the mattress while he fumbles the magazine open to the cover story in the center.   The pages ruffle, glossy sheets slipping over themselves, and then there’s another glimpse of LeBron’s face and his fingers catch and draw the magazine wider.   It’s a half-page image, this time, interrupted by the text of an interview along with the bottom about the finals. Steph doesn’t even skim over the questions about beating the Warriors.   He’s twisting the pages back instead, rolling them around the spine of the magazine so he can hold it up one-handed while he unfastens the front of his jeans with his other.  “Fuck, why,” He says, murmuring the words aloud as if they’ll have some kind of effect on the drag of his own hands on his clothes or on the way his fingers are shaky with the adrenaline of anticipation.   His zipper comes open, the weight of his pants eases, and he pushes his fingers down against the tremor of tension in his stomach and he’s past the point of stopping even before his hand brushes against the half-hard shape of his cock inside his boxers.  Steph huffs out a breath and his fingers close around himself, and when he adds friction over his skin, he can feel the relief of it sweep out into his veins like a wave. He groans faint and low in the back of his throat and settles into the bed, bracing his arm out over him to hold the magazine while his other hand strokes up over the resistance of his hardening cock.   It’s his fingers that tighten into a fist around his cock, but in his head, it’s LeBron’s mascot furry hand.  The photo of LeBron is one of him in action on the court legs wide, fur running all around his body, which Steph is so used to seeing, but not in this new glorious way.   It’s not the image that turns him on usually, but he can appreciate the aesthetics of it, can see the way white jersey brings out the dark color of LeBron’s fur. Steph’s breathing harder, his cock swelling under the rhythmic stroke of his hand, and he lets the magazine slide free of his hold.  “Oh, shit,” Steph blurts, and he rolls over, twisting onto his stomach without letting go of the grip he’s got around his cock. The magazine falls on the bed, and Steph rocks his weight back over his knees, braces himself on his free elbow as he speeds up his hand.   His skin goes hot again, shudders through a wave of warmth, and then he curls his fingers under the promise of the page and turns to the next, and of course it’s what he knew it would be. The block.  The photo shows off the pure strength the other has, the defined muscles in his arms and legs thrusting through the furry shell of a man, the flexing tension along his turtleneck fabric, and Steph can’t breathe, can’t drag his eyes away from the image.   He wants to press his mouth to the edge of LeBron’s hip, wants to lick up his stomach fur; wants to see the shudder of breathing coming pleasure-fast in his chest, and wants to see the line of those shoulders gone slick and glistening with sweat under his suit.   The ache in Steph’s chest collects into his throat, tight and painful until he can almost imagine he’s with LeBron again, instead of choking tears alone.  Steph is quickly coming as his vision hazed to white, jerking himself off through the electricity of heat that surges through him. His movement stutters, strokes falling out-of-rhythm as he comes, and he gasps for breath, tasting LeBron’s name at the back of his tongue like the unvoiced moan is demanding to be set free.   His movement slows, the heat eases.  He blinks his vision back into focus and sees the picture of LeBron again, hissing through another jolt of sensation as the last aftershock of orgasm shakes down his spine to leave him spent and shaky with resolved tension. His hand is sticky, sheets a mess, and he pushes back up over his knees and takes stock of his pants, which are dirty too, damp from pressing too close to the wet of the sheets.  Steph sighs, lets himself go and gets up with shaky legs to clean his bed and his clothes as best he can before he lies down to sleep tonight.  He knows he should get rid of the furry magazine. It’s a source of temptation. He quickly grabs it on the bed and tosses it into the trash, grimacing at himself in disgust.   Steph wants to keep lying to himself and look forward to the new season ahead of him, wants to work harder and faster to beat LeBron and the Cavaliers.   But he can’t.   He spread himself out, warm and heavy over the dirty sheets, lets the haze of his memories form into the present.  And when Steph closes his eyes and he can still imagine LeBron with him, his thoughts whisper, ”You’re in love with him,” and he knows it’s true.   Illusions only work before one knows they’re there... and in the form of a furry costume of the mascot he plays for."
"I like [this](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/) article, which made the case for him to win the 2017 MVP. It makes a lot of the same points as this comment. "
"Stephen Curry has this crazy desire to win even if he has to sacrifice to achieve.  How many superstars would be ok with being used as a decoy as much as he is and doing things that dont show up in the box score. More of the players like that are your Marcus Smart, Pat Bev types. Only other superstar I can think of is Duncan."
Stephen Curry could drop 100 in 3 and a half quarters. 
Agrees. As a basketball fan from China: Before Michael Jordan - Phone Michael Jordan - Mobile Phone Stephen Curry - iPhone  Definitely not saying SC is better than MJ. I'm just talking about the influence they brought to basketball history. 
Well it's also 2k where James Harden is one of the fastest shooting guards in the game. And Stephen Curry is faster than Dante Exum. And Jonas Valancuinas is faster than Pascal Siakam.
That Stephen Curry is sort of hot

"Can't wait for Space Jam 0 prequel set in the 1980's where the Toon Squad are challenged to a basketball game against the physical embodiments of childhood hunger, cancer &amp; various incurable diseases, extreme natural epidemics, and drug addiction.   The Toons obviously recruit Magic Johnson. But the interesting plot twist is that DisaSTARS also recruit 2016 MVP Stephen Curry from the future to play for them."
"You have no idea what you are talking about. With the most recent signing of Demarcus curry was literally the last person and ""most important player""  Bob myers had to gain alignment on. No decision is made without currys final say. You think curry is the captain for shits and giggle? Igoudala is known as one of the most arrogrant dudes and he's said curry is the boss.

No time out Stephen Curry. 
"If someone averaged 4/10 for an entire season they would be considered an all time great shooter.  Assuming they were healthy that would put them over 300 threes on the year, putting them in exclusive company with only Stephen Curry.  "
"4/10 would be considered a great night though.  It’s not an average day because few players in the history of the NBA have averaged 4 threes per game.  Of the 35 players who averaged 40% or more from three last year, only one (Stephen Curry) averaged 4 made threes per game. "
"""You claimed you passed it to Stephen Curry for his 13th 3. The replay determined that was a lie."""
"Stephen ""Egoless"" Curry "
Hot take: Stephen Curry is good at three-point shots.
That's me. I don't mind Durant at all and I understand it's better for the team to have him out there but I love watching Stephen Curry as the team's focal point.
[Stephen Curry would select teammates first if named captain for revamped All-Star Game](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20994143/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-says-select-teammates-all-star-game) 
Stephen Kyrie or Curry Irving
"As if Durant joined golden state because he wants to be the main star. He joined golden state to win and because they are a strong team. Yes, he has Stephen Curry on the warriors and he's a two time MVP. Yes, Klay and Draymond would have been all star anyways, but the thing here is Kerr created GSW's system and was a huge factor for GSW's success. Golden State is good because of their system and of course the players themselves. I mean, if you think he just happened to walk in at the right time that's just being stupid. Their previous coach wasn't able to do it but Kerr did."
"...What? Steph had an outstanding college career at Davidson and the only reason he wasn't picked sooner in the draft was that Dell told the Timberwolves he wouldn't play for them, and that most NBA talent scouts didn't know how to [value him properly as there wasn't anyone in the NBA with his playstyle.](http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-scouting-report-davidson-2009-nba-draft-warriors/odgsfr1n0zs517flvxfb3lg5m). EVEN then, he was a top 10 pick.  I've never understood the narrative that he was mediocre until 2015. He put up 17.5/6.0/4.5 as a rookie and shot 44% from 3 as a rookie. Those numbers are similar to what Rose, Kyrie and Lillard put up in their rookie years, and yet the narrative around those players are that they were good from the jump. He'd have won ROTY if not for Tyreke Evan's amazing 20/5/5 statline.  If you thought Steph broke out in 2015, you weren't watching the NBA back then. He broke the 3 point record in 2013, was widely considered to be snubbed for the all-star game that year, upset the 57 win Nuggets and took 2 games from the Spurs in the Western Conference semi-finals.  In 2014, he made the all-star and second team all-nba in 2014 alongside Tony Parker, and there was legitimate room for debate over whether he deserved first team over Harden. Saying he was a star only in 2015 is like saying Kawhi only became a star last year.   I swear, Steph gets so disrespected around here. "
"Not trying to overreact, but there's a 100 percent chance that Terrance Ferguson becomes the perfect love child of Stephen Curry and Paul George. "
Stephen Curry is a good basketball player.

"I disagree with you, and so, too, does most contemporary discourse (including academia) on race relations and theory. I know that white redditors tend to lampoon the idea that ""you can't be racist towards white people,"" but the reason why that construct exists is just to separate it from good old fashioned bigotry. You need a way to differentiate between bigotry that exists on a micro-scale and bigotry that exists on a macro-scale and is intimately linked with power structures and institutional circumstances. We use ""racism"" to refer to the latter. In a trivial sense, if you fill in your variables with ""black"" and ""white,"" your statement is incorrect from a nuanced perspective (assuming that you accept contemporary definitions that are used even in academia).   If you replace it with ""dark skin"" and ""light skin,"" then you need to do some further examination, because colorism within the black community (and communities from all over Asia and North Africa, etc) is a real thing, and the power that people are granted through colorism lends itself to complicated discussions on what relationships they have with each other and other segments of society. For example, you can make the argument (and there are actual studies that back up similar statements) that players like Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry are more palatable and marketable to the wider NBA audience because they are light-skinned."

"Kawhi's a top 5 player but he's played like 2 games this season. I don't see anywhere near that amount of respect given to Isaiah Thomas, who was 3rd in the league in scoring last season, made the All-NBA second team, and was top 10 in most advanced stat categories. But he hasn't played a game yet this season so nobody talks about his play.   So for the purpose of ""top 10 players in the league right now"" I'm gonna exclude Kawhi, IT, and also Chris Paul due to lack of games played.  Here's my personal top 15 for players this season so far. Format is (Name) - (PER) - (Win Shares) - (VORP).  1. James Harden - 30.6 - 8.1 - 4.0 2. LeBron James - 30.2 - 7.2 - 4.3 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 29.8 - 6.4 - 2.8 4. Stephen Curry - 28.7 - 4.7 - 2.1 5. Kyrie Irving - 25.3 - 5.8 - 2.5 6. Russel Westbrook - 24.5 - 4.7 - 3.6 7. Kevin Durant - 24.8 - 4.7 - 2.0 8. Anthony Davis - 28.4 - 5.5 - 1.8 9. DeMar DeRozan - 23.6 - 5.2 - 1.6 10. LaMarcus Alrdrige - 23.7 - 5.0 - 1.4 11. Karl-Anthony Towns - 23.2 - 5.6 - 2.2 12. Andre Drummond - 23.1 - 4.7 - 2.5 13. Jimmy Butler - 22.5 - 5.2 - 2.1 14. Damian Lillard - 22.6 - 4.5 - 2.1 15. Al Horford - 19.2 - 4.8 - 2.2  Paul George, John Wall, Klay, and Dray don't rate this season. They would be in the next set of names with the likes of Cousins, Lowry, Jokic, Oladipo, Beal, Tyreke Evans, Otto Porter, Kemba Walker, and Kevin Love.  I rate KD, Draymond, and Klay so low because that's what their advanced stats show. I think this can be credited to just Golden State being Golden State. When you have 2 hall of famers and 4 All-Stars, each one doesn't have to carry the load a player of their calibre normally has to on a 1 or 2 all star team.  People have been sleeping on Drummond and LMA's seasons.  I probably rated KAT too high, but his numbers are there. One thing all advanced stats have a hard time showing is defense, which is KAT's biggest weakness."

"What’s LeBron’s finals record over his daddy, Stephen Curry? "
"In 10 years, watch the 30 for 30 on the Warriors' dinasty and predict the whole script. Cool song starts playing and the narrator goes like ""the Champions were back to what could be their swan song, and they wanted to go out banging"".  Dramatic orchestra song starts playing and he continues: ""but then, a single moment appeared to have turned their season: the man who had pitched the Warriors to two time finals MVP Kevin Durant dared him to leave, telling the small forward the team didn't need him to win.""  Next segment shows some irrelevant bench warmer talking about how the locker room atmosphere was tense. For the first time ever, Kerr's team loses three on a row. Have they lost the plot? The NBA rejoices. But then Curry comes back, and the Warriors take flight. Narrator: ""Perhaps, what they really needed that time was their symbol to be back, a man who embodied the revolution of a franchise from lottery dwellers to all-time greats, Stephen Curry.""  Cousins comes back, the team starts winning again and make the playoffs. Documentary focuses now on how the mentality had changed, Green and KD still hate each other's guts, but manage to play well together. The Warriors reach the finals against the Boston Celtics. Journalist remarks that Curry still had a chip over his shoulder for not winning finals MVP.  ""Over the course of six games, the Warriors go 4-2, Curry wins finals MVP and alongside his teammates, his 4th NBA title in 5 years and puts the cherry on the top of a journey who sent the Warriors into the upper echelon of all-time greats. An electrifying team, led by one of the most exciting players to have ever stepped on the hardwood. A team of 5 All-stars, who some said, got so bored of their dominance that they decided to sabotage themselves to make things more interesting"", the narrator concludes, to the background music of an orchestra playing cheesy motivational songs.  The darkest timeline."

"good riddance. we already won without him. He doesn't deserve to be playing next to Stephen Curry on the Warriors after what he did to Westbrook. That snake was too scared to even tell Russ about his decision, thought he was meant to be his friend lmao. And dont say he wasn't required to tell Westbrook, because yeah he wasn't but that's not the reason. He was scared because he knows he's a snake. He sold his soul, he gave up a friend just to benefit himself. He didn't even win in my books, If I won a ring with the Warriors this season I wouldn't claim that I added any value to the team lmaoo."
"the stat came out in this article [https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/nba-insider-tom-haberstroh/stephen-curry-new-michael-jordan](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/nba-insider-tom-haberstroh/stephen-curry-new-michael-jordan) and it's specifically referencing shots from beyond 28 feet, where Steph is, strangely, even *more* efficient than his season-average 3pt %:  &gt;On that night, Curry took eight 3-pointers from 28 feet and beyond, and made six of them. This season, per Basketball-Reference [tracking](http://bkref.com/tiny/Mi0d7),  Curry has taken 25 3-pointers from this area and made a jaw-dropping 16  of them. That’s a conversion rate of 64 percent -- on shots near the  halfcourt logo.   &gt;   &gt;Brooks calls them layups. But if you do the math, they’re more like  dunks. The bonus point within a 3-pointer means that on these deep 3s,  Curry is averaging 1.92 points per attempt this season. Dunk attempts  are averaging 1.82 points this season, [according to Basketball-Reference.com tracking](http://bkref.com/tiny/kjoz6).    &gt;   &gt;Yes, Curry launching from deep this season has been a smidge more efficient than a friggin’ dunk."
"it's from [this](https://hoopshype.com/2018/11/08/stephen-curry-is-as-efficient-on-deep-threes-as-the-nba-average-dunk/) article (and the one that it cites) with the catchy title ""Stephen Curry is as efficient on deep threes as the NBA average dunk""  &amp;#x200B;  however, it's cherry-picking a subset of his 3 pointers (deep ones, so far this season, which is still kind of insane) where he had a high enough percentage to increase the expected value. the flipside is that there are other three pointers where he's hitting at a lower percentage, which makes his overall EV at threes less than that of the average league dunk"
"Your English isn't the problem. Your argument is.  The fact of the matter is that the widely considered ""2nd best player in the world"" has been unable to close out a lot of games without a 2 time MVP by his side. He's 2-4 in this stretch, with his wins against much weaker teams.   The reality is that Steve Kerr has been unable to gameplan victories for these 4 games despite having the aforementioned 2nd best player in the world along with the guy who is probably the 2nd best 3pt shooter in the league.   The reality is that the Warriors go from an elite 65 to 73 win team when Stephen Curry is present to a 0.500 team when he's not.   Sure, the sample size isn't enough to draw long term conclusions- but the sample size is most definitely big enough to recognize that this isn't an anomaly. The Warriors become much much weaker when Curry isn't around, and KD isn't able to do enough to help them. Sure, in the playoffs things are different- you gameplan against opponents, you have players trying harder rather than coasting, you have players actively trying to leave it all on the floor every night. That doesn't change the fact that in the regular season, they very much indeed fall apart without Curry.   The very fact that you end your post with a prediction that KD will win his 3rd finals MVP and the majority of people here aren't acting shocked by the said prediction is proof in and of itself that these games where Curry is out and KD can't even find much regular season success on his own are indeed noteworthy."

In a head-to-head contest, they may well still lose to men but no one is suggesting otherwise.

"as long as he was making the bad shots, i don't think his game would have changed all that much.  a few years ago (and still today) a lot of the shots stephen curry takes i would consider bad shots if anyone else were taking them, but it doesn't matter because they go in."
Apparently 10 year old Trae Young was at this game as well (https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/nba-insider-tom-haberstroh/stephen-curry-new-michael-jordan)
Wardell Stephen Curry II is the best player in the nba
"if you can stand up and you can sit down, is that better for forward motion than being able to merely walk forward? This isn't maths. Thus it's not inherently better two be able to do two things, it's relatively better to be able to do one or two things given the relative situation. Pretty sure you lack some basic understanding of logical thinking. Especially when you take Curry over Holiday as well, despite 2 &gt; 1 and Jrue is clearly doing two things really well while Stephen excels at one thing. It'S because it's relative according to the scale of the quality of the things being done. I don't know how to translate that into your string of argument that consists of 'hurr durr me smart, you dumb, I right, you not, hurr durr'.  And you talk about objective outcome and subjective predictions and then, in the very same sentence, use the subjective analysis and predictions of people as an objective argument. I don't think you quite comprehend how stupid that is.  And it is still your imaginary criteria. Someone disagrees with you and you amount to fuck-all to counter that argument. So, you say he'S a top 15 player, at least Nr. 15 that is, so only 14 guys in this league are better than Butler? So, who's better and who's not? Give me your objective opinion, because as we all know, opinions are objective things... ffs"

"Honestly, it's not all that close to me. I'd rather have Tatum because he has the potential to be a go-to scoring wing on a championship team. Given recent NBA history, you need that player to win a title.   Having a PG as your best player rarely leads to titles, with the recent cases being Chauncey Billups and Stephen Curry. I don't see Doncic ever being the scorer that Steph is and Billups is an outlier."

"Neither is using a cherry picked stat like hey GSW is 10-3 without him in the playoffs. This is not a big enough a sample size for anyone to conclude the contrary. This stat doesn't include the context that the Stephen Curry was injured at the beginning of the playoffs meaning they would either be facing off with a 7th/8th seeded team and that this stat is also spanning their 3-4 year playoff run. They're good with KD, they're good with Steph, but they're god damn nearly unbeatable with both."

It's like they're just searching for anything negative about him and that's the only thing they can find. Appreciate greatness seriously. I believe Curry is one of the most underappreciated players in the league, majority have him ranked below KD which I think is blasphemous as Stephen A would say.   Irony is that these people annoy me as well lmao"
Daily reminder Stephen Curry has 0 finals MVPs
yoooooo it's Wardell Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry makes them the championship team.  KD **guarantees** them a ring.  The Warriors would absolutely be contenders and one of the favorites without KD.  I'd explain it like this: KD is GSW's floor (he will always keep them within 5 points) and Steph is their ceiling (can get them 30 pt leads).  Steph is the Warriors plain and simple.
Yeah cause Stephen Curry is just irrelevant

"&gt; The point his efficiency is so high is because he shot on a low volume.  And I’m telling you that in the history of the entire NBA the only person to ever score 18 or more points in that efficiency was Stephen Curry. If I decrease it to 15, only 6 players in the history of the entire NBA have ever done it. This is why I think you don’t know how TS% works: you have no idea how fucking high .659 is. It’s not something most people ever get to at any volume let alone scoring 18ppg. It essentially never happens. To say he got to that efficiency because of a low volume is categorically and demonstrably false. "
Steph's shot has been once in a generation for at least 6 years.  in 2013 he shot 45% from 3 on around 8 attempts a game.  Just look at this graph for historical context. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/16/upshot/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-3-pointers.html

"I don't think its a matter of training alone. Intangibles things are hard to measure. Unlike heights, weights or even verticals. I would say that Steph has a unique talent because I'm pretty sure that a lot of the NBA players work as much as Steph on shooting the ball or dribbling the ball.   It's just like Michael Jordan's game. There are a lot of players who can be as athletic but you just cannot match the entire package. So I think Stephen Curry is one of a kind shooter and is a rare breed like Michael Jordan or Lebron James. "

He was there when Pop used to get into screaming matches with Stephen Jackson, and he saw how the Spurs overcame those things when they won the championship in 2003. "
I mean Stephen Curry being able to shoot the ball from the moon on good efficiency and KD being a top 3-5 scorer all time are much bigger reasons than Draymond. Put Draymond on the Cavs and they're still picking top 5.

"&gt;Westbrook hadn't missed a game in his life up until his recent injuries. And despite them, he's shown that he can be effective. Consider the tear he was on earlier this season. For the year, despite beating his already aggressive rehab schedule and coming back early, he still put up a 21.6 PER. All indications point to a clean bill of health for the rest of the season.  &gt;Curry is not nearly as fragile as he's painted to be, but he's not Westbrook. Even with all the games he's missed this season, Westbrook has still played in 85% of his team's regular season games (compared to Curry's solid 75%) despite playing 33 more playoff games than Curry (45 to 12).  &gt;You conveniently ignored my main point: defense. As a Warriors fan, I'm sure you see more of Curry than I do (though I do catch a good number of Warriors games since I have them on LP), but it's hard to extol the virtues of Stephen Curry's defense. Westbrook's not Gary Payton, but he's a very capable perimeter defender and has shown the ability to ""shut down"" his assignment at times.  &gt;You're right, they're roughly the same age. Westbrook is about 8 months younger, but I though the gap would be closer to a year. Though, I might argue that's significant itself; Westbrook is younger by the length of a season, yet has been in the NBA a season longer.  &gt;If you still disagree, that's fine, but this is what someone who ranks Westbrook ahead of Curry (in a hypothetical draft with the goal of championship within 5 years) might be thinking. You made it sound like it was an open-shut case in favor of Curry."

"Weird, when I open this link in Twitter as I originally did, it doesn’t show up as paywalled.  My bad, here’s the article if you’re interested:  **The Secret History of the Golden State Warriors’ Unstoppable Play**  *How a stolen basketball play spread from Montana to Colorado State to Utah State to BYU to Iowa State all the way to the reigning NBA champions By Ben Cohen*  The Golden State Warriors call the play Cyclone because they stole it from the Iowa State Cyclones, who called it Cougar because they stole it from the BYU Cougars, who called it Dribble High because they stole it from Utah State. It was called Dribble at Utah State because that’s what it was called at Colorado State and Montana, and the guy who called it Dribble would know its name better than anyone.   “That was something I drew up a long, long time ago,” said Stew Morrill.   The clever play that Morrill doodled on a chalkboard in the Montana coach’s office more than 30 years ago soon began to spread, and it was such a good idea that it was adopted by rival coaches and local high schools wherever Morrill coached.   But how did something drawn up a long, long time ago eventually make its way to the Warriors? It took an unlikely series of seemingly unrelated heists for this one play to be perfected by one of the best teams in the history of basketball. And not even the people involved fully understood their pivotal roles in the chain that links Morrill to a potential NBA dynasty.   One summer day in 2015, Steve Kerr was having lunch with Fred Hoiberg. Kerr had recently coached Golden State to a championship, and Hoiberg had recently left his college job for the Chicago Bulls. They were chatting about basketball strategy when Hoiberg said he’d noticed that the Warriors used one of his plays. Kerr told him they actually named it Cyclone in honor of Iowa State. That’s when Hoiberg confessed. It wasn’t his play. He’d taken it from BYU coach Dave Rose. And it wasn’t his play, either. “We’re all thieves in this business,” Hoiberg said.   But someone at some point had to come up with something original. As it turns out, when you trace the play back to its origins, that someone was Stew Morrill.   Morrill, who retired in 2015 after more than 600 wins at three schools, had a reputation among his peers for this sort of X’s and O’s wizardry. “I love Stew’s stuff,” Hoiberg said. Morrill was a widely respected tactician. There was nothing he enjoyed more than being in his office late at night eating pizza, drinking beer and diagraming plays.   “Sometimes it was really good, and sometimes it was really bad,” Morrill said. “Dribble was one of those that was really good.”   He came up with Dribble all the way back in 1986, his first season as a head coach, while tinkering with his trusty assistant Blaine Taylor. It had everything they wanted in a set play. It was quick. It was deceptive. And it was almost impossible to defend when executed properly.   Here’s how it works. The play begins with the misdirection of two guards whooshing past each other underneath the basket. One guard (Andre Iguodala below) continues to the wing and catches the first pass as the other guard (Stephen Curry) curls upward and sets a back-screen for a big man (Draymond Green). “There is no play if the guy doesn’t set a bone-crusher,” Morrill said. Then comes a pass from Iguodala to Green rolling off the Curry pick. If everything goes to plan—the cross, the first pass, the screen and the second precisely timed pass—the finish should be the easiest part.   Morrill’s teams ran this play so many times in so many games for so many layups that eventually they had to get creative with it. He disguised his calls using an elaborate system of cards—“we weren’t yelling Dribble,” he said—and took his precautionary measures to the extreme in league games against the opponents they played every year.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBJ-VgZniw0"
"&gt; I don't see any real argument to hedge and keep the Brooklyn pick. If LeBron leaves they're a decade away from being competitive. A top 7 pick isn't going to significantly change that and by the time a player picked next year develops the rest of the team will be post-prime.   Thank you. I get that nobody wants to tank for years and watch your team continually go  &lt; .500. Believe me, I've had enough of that shit. But at this point the Cavaliers are so handicapped that not going all in seems weird to me. Yes, you might ""waste"" the pick if you're hedging against LeBron leaving and thus lose a year -- but you're going to have to do that regardless.   Either the Cavs are really high on this draft class, or they don't want to seem like they're getting fleeced. I don't follow college/highschool basketball enough to form a reasonable opinion about it, but unless you're picking up another LeBron, Kevin Durant, or Stephen Curry, it's not worth risking the sure-fire LeBron you have this year.  As a Raptors fan, however, I hope they keep it."

"I don't think you appreciate how much having Curry next to him opens up the floor for Klay. If Kawhi were play next to Steph Curry, he would take a lot more 3s as well - perhaps not twice as many, but a lot.  I don't have the detailed data or the breakdown between 2s and 3s, but with Curry off the floor, Klay shot around 55 TS% ([source](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/)), compared to Kawhi's 61% as the #1 option. Think about how much Kawhi would improve if he was the one playing next to Curry? His catch and shoot percentages would look better on higher volume (just like Klay's does when Curry is on the floor), and he would have a lot more space for cutting.  And this is all still not even touching on the fact that Kawhi is a better defender than Klay."
"and Oscar Robertson didn't win Finals MVP and neither did Jason Kidd.

In 2017 especially, Stephen Curry straight up played better than both Robertson and Kidd in their respective finals."

I'm not sure any of the top players these days are CRAZY enough to actually do something like that. Is there really anyone in the league these days nearly equivalent the Artest or Stephen Jackson on the crazy scale? Guys like Lebron and Curry are basically boy scouts compared to some of the stars even 15 years ago.
"Sorry, was thinking OP must have meant 5v5 scrimmages vs shootarounds etc. (do the cavs really not do any form of practice? really?)  Was referring to this article saying they never scrimmage anymore and do lighter practices now.

When they do practice, Kerr has scaled back his approach and the attendant demands. The Warriors scrimmaged quite a bit in his first season. Now they never do. Practices are generally lighter than they once were, and shootarounds shorter.  Edit: Adding a quote by Shaun Livingston, one of the older guys on our team.   &gt;“It’s hard. It’s hard, man. It’s the hardest year yet, the fourth year,” Shaun Livingston said. “Accomplished regular-season goals. Won championships. It’s tough.”"

"When the Cavs finally won, all eyes looked to Lebron. For an hour, they all lost sight of the King. There was still one last hurdle he had to thrust his way through.   LeBron snuck away from the buzz of the locker room and tried through the bowls of Quicken Loans underground undetected. He dodged past paparazzi and fandom alike, brow burning and on a mission   Stephen Curry stood beside himself, left alone to swelter in the showers of Oracle Arena. His teammates were long gone. No fan remained in the venue. All ceased to stir in the venue, except for the gumbotron’s looped animations and Curry’s hands, caressing his slim figure while the shower’s jets cooled his sticky torso.  The Cleveland Cavaliers had just defeated the Golden State Warriors. The Splash Brother sighed quietly to himself and lowered his head. “Fuck LeBron…” he mumbled numbly. “Fuck LeBron…Fuck Le—“   “Say it again, boy.”  Steph opened his eyes at the sound of the voice, realizing an engorged shadow draped over his being. He turned around to see LeBron James’s towering figure imposing over him. He was wearing nothing but his signature headband and a thinly veiled towel, his bulging manhood accenting throw its fabric.  “I never want to hear you say ‘LeBron’ again,” the Akron Hammer roared. ""You're to call me ‘LeDaddy’ from now on.”  “Heavy is the head that wears the crown,” said Curry.  “Then allow me to lighten the load.” The King then grabbed Curry’s flacid penis with his worn yet swollen, supple hands.   “Let’s see if you live up to your “Splash Brother” nickname,” the King said, falling to the floor then thrusting the young boy’s mouth deep into his puckering tight asshole.   “That’s the only ring you’re gonna taste this year,” the king bellowed forth. Curry tossed the father of 4’s salad in rhythmic succession. He began to enjoy himself, feeding off LeBron’s energy. “I can see why he makes his teammates so much better” Curry thought. Now, it was his turn to play.   “You think you’re the lion of the league,” said Curry, mockingly. “Yet you purr like a kitten.”  Big mistake.  “Trash talk, eh?” quipped the King. With one hand, he flipped Steph over and mounted himself behind him. ""I'll show you why they call me The Chosen One."" He then grabbed both of Curry’s dimpled, pasty white cheeks and spread them like Moses parting the red sea.  Curry moaned in excited agony. He then coyly peaked back, and his eyes bulged. LeBron’s erection was at full mast. It was defiant, with pornstar-esque length, the girth of a clorox wipes container, and veiny triumphance akin to a body builder’s wrist.   “You’ve heard of LeBron…now prepare to receive LeBrarm.”  The King thrusted his manhood deep into Curry’s gaping slit. His 2-time MVP form quickly melted away in id-pleasing ecstasy. His moans rattled the locker room as their bodies became one in a euphoric wave of sweat and steam.   Suddenly, The Chosen One had his fill, and unleashed a king-sized load upon Curry’s orifice.   LeBron looked at the baby-faced assassin and gleamed sternly into his eyes.  “Next time you utter my name, what will you say?”   “LeDaddy.”  “Again.”  “LeDaddy.”  “That’s goddamn right.”"
"Well... yeah. Because that's the time for that conversation. It makes no sense to talk about how Amazon killed Walmart when Walmart has a historic quarter, does it?  Kevin Durant DID ruin the NBA. Has the NBA EVER been THIS inevitable? You lost STEPHEN CURRY. The only unanimous MVP in NBA HISTORY. And your team literally didn't even blink an eye. In fact, you rest TWO of {KD, Steph, Klay, Dray} and y'all STILL blowout teams. Literally no team in NBA history has had that luxury..."

"You can't be top 10 until you have incredible longevity too, imo. *Could* Stephen Curry go down as a top 10 player? I think so. Will he? We can only wait and see.   But to call him Top 10 right now is highly contentious. If Curry's career ended this very moment, there's absolutely no way he would be in the top 10, merely from the fact that all the other top 10 players played more and were just as good - if not better - for longer.  Also, I can't tell if you're trolling lol. I really hope so."

"Seems so pedantic, but there is a difference between ""better"" and ""more valuable"" in this context, and Warriors fans have discussed it ad nauseum. I'm going to preface what's to come by saying that it is my opinion, based on watching 90% of games since Steph's first game in the league:  ""Kevin Durant is the better overall basketball player, but Stephen Curry is the more valuable basketball player to this Warriors team."" It is a narrative that Warriors fans have created to help cope with Curry sharing the crown, and alas, I am leaning slightly towards agreeing with it, thus far. Kevin missed 19 games last season with an MCL strain, and Steph has missed 12 games so far this season with an ankle injury. In these games, and these games alone, I saw the Warriors playing better basketball while Durant was out, *once they adjusted.*  The difference wasn't much, but from what I saw, the Warriors' defensive strength in Steph's absence was not worth the overall offensive stagnation w/ Durant. Then again, I believe in matchups dictating all of this, that teams don't play the same competition over and over again, and therefore while Curry might be most important against one team, Durant is the better asset against another.   Then, we can argue the value of offense vs the value of defense, the positions/roles they play correlating directly to how well those around them perform, etc. It's an intriguing argument either way, and a fun one to have as a spoiled Warriors fan."
"Come on, son. If you’re gonna post a locked article at least include the major points or just copy the entire article. Then again, you wonder how many people actually read this stuff.   *edit: lol, based on the comments here so far it’s clearly people just reacting to the title. Leroux is basically laying out how difficult it would be.   ——  Anthony Davis is under contract with the New Orleans Pelicans and his current deal runs through 2019-20 with a player option worth $28.8 million for the 2020-21 season. As such, if the Warriors were to actually pursue him, there are three basic paths they could use to acquire him in the next few years:  **Free agency**  The current expectation is that unless the talented big man signs an extension (he will likely qualify for a Designated Veteran one between now and then, which could be its own piece), Davis will opt out and become an unrestricted free agent in July 2020. Realistically, any team looking to bring him aboard would need to be able to offer Davis his maximum.  RealGM’s salary cap resource is using a $113.4 million estimate for that season's cap figure, meaning a 30 percent maximum contract would start at $34,020,000 (maximum total salary for a new team: four years, $146.3 million). Stephen Curry is the only Warrior under contract for 2020-21 at this point, but his $43 million salary makes a pretty significant dent.  To sign Davis as a free agent, the Warriors could only have another $36.4 million in committed salary and holds for the entire rest of the roster, presumably including Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and/or Draymond Green. That looks incredibly unlikely and the unrestricted free agency door may be closed as soon as this summer if Durant re-signs on a long-term deal.  **Sign-and-trade**  One way around clearing cap space is acquiring Davis via a sign-and-trade. That would require the Pelicans being on board, but the Warriors would presumably have significant talent to send back, potentially including one or more of their current All-Stars.  A Davis sign-and-trade would have three big challenges. The first is that the Pelicans would have to agree to any deal. They would wield significant leverage since the previously detailed path to signing Davis with cap space is so difficult. It seems likely the Warriors would have some serious talent that could be included, but remember that both Green and Thompson will be in their 30s in 2020 and New Orleans would presumably be looking to rebuild rather than reload. A three-way trade could reroute quality players to a franchise with more immediate aspirations, but that gets even more complicated.  The second and, in some circumstances, most significant difficulty is that a sign-and-trade would subject the team to the hard cap for that season, meaning they could not go over the “apron” (about $6 million above the luxury tax) for any reason, including unlikely bonuses. The Warriors dealt with this back in 2013-14 when they brought in Andre Iguodala, but that was a much less expensive team. A tentative line there would be about $143 million in total salary for that entire league year without exception. That is certainly more workable than clearing space to sign Davis as a free agent but still challenging.  Finally, under current trade rules, the Warriors would have to send at least $27.2 million if Davis starts at his projected maximum, whether the Pelicans want that kind of money or not. Again, some of that salary could end up with a third team, but they already have Jrue Holiday on the books for $26.1 million that season and could be locking up DeMarcus Cousins for a significant sum as well.  **Trade**  Unlike the first two options, a straight trade does not require waiting until Davis becomes a free agent. The Warriors and Pelicans simply have to agree to terms during any one of the trading windows, as soon as right now or as late as July 2020  should Davis opt-in to streamline a trade like Chris Paul did last offseason.  From the Warriors' perspective, this would be the cleanest way to bring Davis on board since they would not be subject to the hard cap and would possess full Bird rights at the end of Davis’ contract, adding flexibility they have not had with Durant, though that limitation likely fueled Durant’s pay cut this season.  A trade would require at least $20 million in salary going back to New Orleans, but any combination of Warriors players good enough to be worth Davis carries that price tag anyway. I will not speculate on what would be necessary to bring over the currently 24-year-old All-NBA player, but the price tag is astronomical and will stay that way if he can remain remotely healthy.  It's even be possible that the two sides could not come to an agreement because presumably at least Curry and probably Durant would be off the table, and some front offices would not be willing to deal a young franchise cornerstone for a package without a partner’s top asset out of pride or fear of a fanbase revolt. Furthermore, upcoming free agency for Thompson and Green complicates deals because either New Orleans, or a third party if the Pelicans wanted to reroute some of what they receive, may not expect them to re-sign, thus limiting their trade value.  The lack of salary flexibility makes bringing in Anthony Davis substantially less likely than their pursuit of Kevin Durant a year-and-a-half ago. That said, the NBA has been and will be a superstar-driven league with big names taking their talents elsewhere so there is absolutely a chance, especially if the Pelicans are interested in what the Warriors can offer."

"Well MAYBE the fact that the player who shot the ball actually worked his whole life to improve his shot and make sure that every time he shoot he have a little bit more of odds to make it?

I'm pretty sure if that shot is taken by Stephen Curry or taken by my alcoholic uncle the odds of making the ball go in or out after rolling 5 times around the rim are higher with Stephen Curry because he actually have pure talent and worked 24/7 to make sure he can make more baskets than any other human beings on earth (not saying Steph is best shooter ever, its just an exemple lol).

Don't really think too much of it, as Strauss said himself most were just KD slipping out, often for a long jumper. Basically very few advantageous short rolls/4 on 3 situations or forced switches. And that was all in the first ~2-3 months of KD joining the Dubs.   Definitely would be interesting to see this data updated. Reckon it's much more efficient these days. IIRC, they ran about 15-20 Steph/KD PnRs in game 5 alone"

"Here you go man, top article when I googled it: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/  I get that you want more evidence than ""watch the games"" but its really hard to quantify ""defensive attention"" in a stat. You don't at any point in this conversation specify what would count as evidence here, so its hard to provide it. There is no ""defensive attention"" stat, the easiest way to get a read on this is actually to just watch the games.   Is that an objective measure? No. But it is a better measure than any alternative you have offered."
"???  Don't get me wrong, I'm personally still on the fence about which team would win, but the 2004 Pistons defense is not nearly as collapsed as you're making them out to be.  They had the 2nd best defensive rating of that season for a reason, arguably the best once they added Rasheed Wallace. Isolations are something they experienced a large amount of as well as screens. They won in the playoffs 4-1 against the 2004 Lakers, one of the faster-paced teams in a league era dedicated to movement. They played against Prime Kobe, Shaq, Gary Payton (give or take, really) and Karl Malone. Those four represent four different ways to score alone.  I'd argue they'd take a game or even two from the Warriors.  And that's BEFORE you add Michael Jordan to the list. You've now turned a team with two great defensive players (Ben and Rasheed) into a team with three. Mismatches? Maybe Chauncey vs. Steph. Even then, a quick switch and you can Jordan or Tayshaun guard him. You can afford to put Tayshaun or Rip on the bench, further bolstering the team's production compared to the lackluster bench of the Warriors.  Michael Jordan alone requires defensive play willing to foul out of a game for him. He had outstanding court vision enough that a double team would be extremely risky with the Pistons players and he'd defensively restrict Kevin Durant enough to slow him to cap at 20 PPG at best, 15 PPG at worst. Plus, despite your '25 shots a game' assertion, you're talking about a man who showed that he could [shoot less and pass more](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01/gamelog/1991/) at the prime of his career when needed. Even then, the 2004 Pistons would have probably fared better as a team if they had someone who could score more consistently, since their biggest issue was almost certainly their volume. Statistically, the man was a better shooter, passer and defender than Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson during an extremely physical era in basketball. It wouldn't be hard to argue a case that he scores even more in this era.  I think it says a lot about the Warriors that I can say all of that and still be undecided, but it's ridiculous to think a sweep would be in place based of offensive/defensive comparisons of different eras. 2004 was much more team-based whereas current times is much more star-based. And 1992 . . . geez, I guess I'm getting to a point where I have to admit it was a different style of play altogether."

"1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Stephen Curry  4) Anthony Davis  5) James Harden  6) Kawhi Leonard (when healthy)  7) Russell Westbrook  8) Giannis Antetokoumpo  9) Kyrie Irving  10) Joel Embiid  Honourable Mention: George, Paul, Lillard, Butler, Cousins, Derozan"
"“Upon review, Stephen Curry had his foot out of bounds for the 94 foot overtime game winning shot against the Sixers in game 7. The Sixers should have been the NBA Champions. Our bad.” "
"He fucking won finals MVP in his first season. Lonzo would be considered a resounding success if he could even become as good as Jason Kidd, who himself in his prime wasn't half the player Magic was as a rookie.  If Stephen Curry was a free agent this year, do you think the Lakers would say ""Nah bro, I'm good, we got Lonzo""? Fuck no. They'd trade Lonzo in a fucking heartbeat and sign Steph to a supermax."
"No. I’d rather have the following players over Westbrook:  Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Lebron James, Giannis Antekoumpo, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Anthony Davis.   So he is 13th best right now "
"Ricky ""Stephen Curry"" Rubio"
LoL  I was reading as Stephen....and I think 'well is hard to guard curry in pnr' and then I saw hawking lmao
"&gt; Golden State: Stephen Curry  No offense to Steph, but historically speaking I'd probably put Wilt up there."

Warriors look great without Stephen Curry..
"Honestly this sub can be really toxic sometimes. Especially in the playoffs.  It can be super annoying if you go against the circle jerk and you have some kid with a new account act like he's some intellectual only to see his flair is ""[GSW] Stephen Curry."" Honestly no problem to be a warriors fan, but when you go around talking constant shit to every fan base (especially talking shit about okc) it makes everyone else not want to conversate. I come here for easy going users and general fun atmosphere. "

Let's sing his summoning song:  First name Stephen last name curry  He came into my life now everything is less blurry 
#Stephen Curry#
"“If the Spurs weren’t short handed”.   If we are playing that game, if the Warriors weren’t short handed and had STEPHEN freakin CURRY...  They don’t get to pick their opponent. Or their opponents’ health. They played well enough to win the matchup they had. "
"He'll have 5 Bucks draped on him  Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, and thanks to some last second magic by Danny Ainge, a healthy Stephen Curry, all four will be open.  btw Smart's my favorite player"
"Derrick ""Stephen Curry"" Rose!"
"Derrick ""Stephen Curry"" Rose"
This team does not have Stephen Curry though
I would argue Curry as the number 1 team basketball player.. and how the fuck do you just conveniently forget Stephen Curry. Oh they remembered him alright. Just didn’t want to mention him. First take constantly  hates on Curry and we all know that Iverson  is jealous of Curry’s career.

"Fuckin disgrace .to not even mention Stephen Curry. Who cares if he’s injured. It’s only temporary and last time I checked, Curry’s skills have not diminished. Just more Stephen Curry hate. Not really surprised tbh. "

Idk about Donovan 
"Durant left so he could go to a team that was already stacked with  three all stars. Stephen curry was a back to back mvp. Draymond and Klay are two way players. Not to mention it was a team he blew a lead against in the finals and it was a 73-9 team. Also, he took shots at okc saying "" can't win a championship with those cats"" along with using a fake account. He even said he wanted to stay in okc for the rest of his career and win a championship but eventually he gave up."
"Dude, he isn't able to win one game against Utah Jazz whose primary scorer is a Rookie (albeit he plays incredibly well for a Rookie). The game OKC won this series is a game PG13 won, not Russwest.   Idk why you hating so much on Steph. If you need more actual facts and numbers on why Stephen has Westbrook beat by a mile I advise you to read [this](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/) and especially this [this](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/)  Feel free to come up with good arguments to counter this, however don't continue with hypothetical statements ""would've won this and that"". Besides, KD maybe would've won more games if Bosh and Wade were out, as he was far superior during any playoff run WB and KD had together. You just sound really salty tbh, and idk why. Stephen is probably the best shooter this game has ever seen and you're just whining bunches."

"Stephen Curry, Michael Conley, Anthony Parker, Kevin Wardell Durant, etc"
Where does Stephen Curry rank all-time?
[\[LINK\]](http://variety.com/2018/film/news/sony-stephen-curry-1202782583/) to the actual article.
"As long as they behave Victor Oladipo as Stephen Curry defense is problem imo. Yet I did not talk about they keep Calderon,Korver and Love at the same time."
"While Durant had Green on his squad—""You know he's got your back if something jumps off""—Green, surveying his own locker room for his squad, looked right past Durant and Stephen Curry, presumably because it's hard to imagine either of them in an actual fight. Instead, he took Warriors power forward David West along with Oladipo, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook to join him in the park.   Good choices "
"They've had him guard Draymond in the past in the reg season it's not something they haven't done before   Switches do happen there's nothing you can do to avoid it sometimes but saying ""there's no point having Harden guard Draymond he's just going to get switched off him"" is the equivalent of saying ""might as well just have stephen curry be the primary defender on Harden you know they'll just get him switched on to him anyway"". No....you make the other team work to get that switch it's always easier said than done even if it looks easy   They did have him guard Klay a lot the past two games and in game 2 he did a solid job of it. That is one way to use him but in general I would still try and hide him on a big when the opportunity presents itself if I can at times  I do agree Iguodala is the best hiding spot although when possible in an ideal world they like to put CP on him so he can just play the free safety role to read passing lanes and not have to worry about his man a lot"
"Steph is the cog of a team that, when working properly, can defeat any team in the NBA. You can actually take [KD's word](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2018/03/11/kevin-durant-stephen-curry-is-the-system-here/) for it, and say Steph is the system. So when Steph performs well, probably the most important part of an all\-time great team.. we all know how that goes.  Kevin, however transcendent his talents are, is only a part of that system. Unless he can be so efficient that he can be his typical venomous self and guarantee that his teammates are still getting theirs, he's going for those ISO chances. Once that happens, his teammates adjust to feed him the ball. They get Durant the slim reaper, but not Durant the player who works hard to get everybody involved."
"Were people really saying that? People's expectations with Stephen Curry are of such a ridiculous level I've never seen other super stars be faced with. Westbrook, Harden, they can and did have terrible games this post season but there was no hot takes. Curry missing half the season with injury probably created the context but damn, there are some people itching for an excuse to discredit him."

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xge_HlAyMk&amp;t=36s  The Steph Shimmy   At Davidson, its where the story begins,  started the path to record setting  wins 1st team all nation,  ball became his vocation,  2 decades of stardom in the making.  Burst on the scene in the elite 8,  began to love lean learned of his fate  he was a warrior drafted way too late,  but he changed the game and made the common man great.  Five years in to the association,  kid became a man, became a revelation,  started a revolution as he rivaled king james,  and the world around him was supporting these claims.  From each one’s birth they were forever connected.  Statues to one day be fully erected  in the image of the king and his successor,  changing the game of his predecessors.  World began to link the 2, stood back and waited,  goal became make the other look sedated,  talk show hosts constantly debated,  but same hospital don’t make them related.  can you really say one is overrated? kid (both) forever loved,  while the king was always hated(and theyll both always be hated)   It Became All about the crossover, the step back Hit the 3, don’t look just turn back Get a steal, oh shoot its a foul Throw your mouth guard and let go for a while The Steph shimmy   He puts a name on his hitlist, call him arya stark, only instead of a sword, hes got a 3 point arc, so don’t betray, don’t pull a walder fray, or youll be left with a dagger of a j as he shimmies away. Yea, hes The baby faced assasin, smoother than michael jackson, first mvp, unanimously not lebron, not shaq, not even kobe can say that they were voted the best by every single soul from the east to the west. Yea and more and more than anyone else, hes the peoples champion, what we see in ourselves, 6’3 180, cant soar through the sky but he makes the world believe we all shoot dead eye Cuz it’s a Flick of the wrist, a shot up in a hurry, the world loves the great stephen curry. Wear that number 30 hit some 3s in a flurry , hit em with that shimmy make it look so dirty. Its all about the crossover, the step back Hit the 3, don’t look just turn back Get a steal, oh shoot its a foul Throw your mouth guard and let go for a while The Steph shimmy Now hold on now, this ain’t no attack cuz the king takes the high road, he don't give no flack but if I'm not mistaken while there’s a diss on shaq, the king picked up a city and he put em on his back unanimous mvp? Ha, that's the regular season, talk to me when you the king of the postseason, triple double, handful of rings to the name, and almost every record that’s belonged to this game. But don't get me started on that family of yours, a spoon in your mouth since you're in diapers. Daddy can shoot, brother can ball, so what can I say you're just one of them all. Out there trying to cover up some scars by teaming up with a bunch of allstars, quickly becoming a bunch a monstars, leaving the king with just one thing left to do and that’s call his man bugs bunny, turn this into some spacejam 2 Theres no respect, the kids just about the crossover, the step back Hit the 3, don’t look just turn back Get a steal, oh shoot its a foul Throw your mouth guard and let go for a while Yea its number 30 for 3. Its curry for 3. When he shoots a 3 its like Muhammad ali, float like a butterfly sting like a bee, no one can guard what they cannot see and with the basket in sight, he’s ali in a fight, he’s yao and his height, he’s Michael Jordan in flight. They all changed the game, inspired a people, call them originals, all else just the sequel. And at the end of the day when the sun starts to set, how many can say they truly changed the way we put a ball in the net. One for sure is this kid turned seasoned vet of the game, raised in the shadow of the true king James but without a doubt his legacy will say one of the greatest in the hall of fame. Hes all about the crossover, the step back Hit the 3, don’t look just turn back, yea Get a steal, oh shoot it’s a foul Throw your mouth guard and let go for a while A flick of the wrist, a shot up in a hurry, the world loves the great stephen curry. Wear that number 30 hit some 3s in a flurry , hit em with the shimmy make it look so dirty."

# STEPHEN CURRY
Darn you Stephen Curry 
&gt;	Stephen Curry has his first 30-point game of the 2018 postseason with 30 points (28th career 30-point playoff game).
"The inevitable “Stephen Curry is back!” game right after the “he’s injured” games. THIS is who Curry is, he was just off."
"I'm not sure it's lazy as much as it was just kinda... bad. He had the right idea in the corner at least, but when you crowd someone who still has a live dribble at their disposal, you're going to get rocked by that jab step.   Of course, easy for me to sit here and call someone's defense bad when they're trying to stay in front of Stephen Curry. "
STEPHEN CURRY AND BEATING HITLER IN THE PLAYOFFS. One of many iconic duos! 
Stephen Curry is the best player on the planet. 
Stephen Curry has ruined basketball 
Dirk Nowitzki&gt;Stephen Curry 
have you met a player named stephen curry
"The Suns will go ahead and draft ""local boy"" Ayton as the fans requested because of his god\-like physique. Then 5 years from now, they will be like ""WTF, god damn"" and go back to have another 1st pick while Doncic is busy competing in the NBA MVP race. A cautionary tale, just look at Blake Griffin and Stephen Curry, screw the athleticism potential bullshit. Hell I bet if OKC can trade MVP Westbrook for Curry right now they would still do in a heartbeat. And Curry was and is still no where near the athleticism of Griffin and Westbrook. Athleticism is important but does not mean shit compared to tangibles and switchability in today's game."
THE BRILLIANT SHOOTING OF STEPHEN CURRY CONTINUES
man the celtics are shooting like stephen curry tonight
I just remember seeing it in reports like this: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2694031-vivek-ranadive-reportedly-thinks-buddy-hield-has-the-potential-of-stephen-curry
Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter of all time. Don't expect him to play like crap in the next couple of games. He cooks at Oracle.
"&gt;When the kings traded Demarcus Cousins for basically buddy hield and the 10th pick, the kings owner said buddy was the next Stephen Curry.  No. He didn't. Why do people still think this? It's a fucking meme."
"When the kings traded Demarcus Cousins for basically buddy hield and the 10th pick, the kings owner said buddy was the next Stephen Curry. I agree that buddy is awesome, just not the greatest shooter of all time with two mvp's and two rings!"
"&gt; We know the Rockets are hunting Stephen Curry. That is not novel, and not something to do just because Curry is recovering from another ill-timed knee injury. The Cavaliers mastered this. "

"That's what's hapenning. Houston focuses on attacking two most important GSW players - Curry and Dray - and by distrupting them, they disrupt the whole team.   KD can score a lot that way, but outside of the sole points he scored, nothing else comes from it, he's not being doubled, they let him switch onto mismatches a lot without bending the defense to risk opening Curry, he has 1 assist in the series (that really says a lot), and with Dray not keeping the shape in defense, Durant can be blown by all game (which most comments just ignore like it doesn't matter that your team concedes points easily). All are said as arguments that whatever qualities he has, doing his one job of scoring the best, he's not the most important to this particular team - which the rivals, professional basketball players and coaches, acknowledge by not targeting him, but Curry and Dray.  I'm almost surprised no one talks more about the Dray problem. Warriors can kinda deal in offense when Curry is stopped, with KD - they scored pretty well in this game, overall. It's their defense that was very bad. Their defense has no ""option B"" if Dray is not doing his job. Why no one talks about that? It loses them real basketball games.  I dunno what's so hard about that. It's not about some moral responsibility of the great sinner Wardell Stephen Curry, like this guy seems to think. No one is saying he's like, good morally, or that he done well in a game (in which he had very, very different circumstances than Durant, as described above - and yeah, he struggled, he gets tired and that is his weak point, and we know it for years). It's just what's happening in basketball terms.  (Controversial trivia: point/combo guards/point forwards/point centers who can both score and create are the most important players in most teams in the league)."

"&gt;I love Stephen Curry, but it certainly feels like the media always defends him if he’s playing poorly. He’s not 100%! The same “maybe?” injury cropped up in the Finals as well when he had a deer in the headlights look to him.  This is definitely an annoying trend. Just last round he was flexing and hot dogging on the Pelicans. Now he's hurt?  EDIT: Not to say he's not banged up or not 100%. And to his credit he hasn't taken the injury excuse, but the two narratives don't jive. "

"It's because Curry has statistically been the better player than Durant on average in the playoffs for their career. Curry has a higher TS%, BPM, and net rating for his career than Durant. In 14-15 and 16-17, the Warriors two championship years, Curry led all players in the playoffs for OBPM.  Stephen Curry is one of the best playoff performers in NBA history. The bar for him is perfection though, so any bad performance has been unreasonably held against him. It's not like Curry has ever gone out there like Lebron and averaged 11 PPG for a finals series.   Kevin Durant is also one of the best playoff performers too.   I think Durant will be better statistically moving forward though because he gets to benefit greatly from Curry's gravity, while Curry is the only player whose Curry's gravity negatively impacts.  "

"Seth had a bad career, but he had a solid season this year. Judging by this year alone, I do think he is a starting calibre player.   You know, this remind me when we first get Wiggins, and the ""analyse"" was saying his floor is an athletic starting SF and ceiling is Kobe or ""the stars"" and I was like ""Say What?"". Anw, my point is nobody really knows how all these picks will turnout, its natural that the difference between their ceiling and floor people give them are quite huge, especially for risky players like Young. Well, at least I am not calling Jimmer Fredett and Stephen Curry."
"This is laughable really. There have been a lot of dinasties, but not such an overwhelming juggernaut that could loose his best player and still win it easily. Take LeBron out of Miami and they not making the ECF even. All the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls dinasties had legit rivals, people loved those eras because there was something called SUSPENSE regarding who would win the championship. Yes, even with MJ.   Don´t try to compare me LeBron´s teams to this GSW team. Never in history two of the best players have played in their prime together PLUS two additional Top-15 players. Its ridiculous. Wade was a Top-10 player at most.   Crackheads really comparing the Heat with the Warriors. One has 2x MVP Stephen Curry at Point Guard and other had Carlos Arroyo starting at PG. SMH. "
"He cannot do both for 45 minutes a night at an all-nba level like he did in Miami he gets tired he's human and he's older how is that difficult to understand? Do you think it's easy scoring 40 points in a road game creating all your shots off the dribble against great defense that is designed to stop you?  jesus christ Have you ever play basketball in your life? Do you know how tiring it is to run up and down the length of full court basketball court for even 10 minutes and still maintain efficient offense at that? That in itself is amazing I'm exhausted after I score 10 points in a full court basketball game and I'm absolutely useless after that.  Hell, part of the reason he could play all-nba defense in Miami and in 2016 is because he had other star teammates to help with offense.   &gt; Maybe he puts up 30 and actually gets some stops, shows his squad he gives af for a change?   But he does though? He has 3 blocks in this series already he's the leading shot blocker in the whole series. Only 6 players have more blocks than James in the playoffs so far and they're all defensive specialists (Capela, Gobert, Davis, Horford, Draymond, and Valanciunas). Only 5 players have more steals (Harden, Paul, Draymond, Smart, and Davis). He is actually still the 2nd best defensive player in this series behind Marcus Smart.  He's [18th in deflections](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=DEFLECTIONS&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals), 8th in [loose balls recovered](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=LOOSE_BALLS_RECOVERED&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals), tied for [3rd in charges drawn](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=CHARGES_DRAWN&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals), 18th in [contested 2 point shots](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=CONTESTED_SHOTS_2PT&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals), and 7th in [contested 3 point shots](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=CONTESTED_SHOTS_3PT&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals).  Of course he deserves some blame if they lose.  The Warriors are 11th in team defensive rating and 3rd in offense. It is by the number their offense not their defense that is better and by the eye test it's obviously their offense that is so killer because they have so many stars  &gt;If you think offense is more important than defense then you don’t understand basketball.  So who's more valuable to the Warriors, Stephen Curry or Draymond Green? Answer that and prove your great understanding of basketball."

"It's hard without full access to the stats but this article is insightful: http://thesportsquotient.com/nba/2016/2/24/how-stephen-curry-dominates-the-paint  I should probably walk back my statement and say that Steph and Kyrie are at least comparable as finishers. I think Steph is more consistent and fundamentally, his layups and floaters are perfection. But I would give Kyrie the edge in difficulty of attempts and ability to make really tough, contested finishes. How you define ""better finisher"" will ultimately allow you to choose between the two depending on whether you value degree of difficulty or consistency.  Kyrie and Steph have aspects of both, while a guy like Westbrook has tremendous degree of difficulty but is very inconsistent/inefficient around the rim."
18 pts on 15 shots. That’s a bad game for Stephen curry. Also proves why this warriors team is essentially invincible.

Not according to Second Spectrum tracking (used officially by the league). Harden had 1.31 PPP against Curry.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23507554/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-says-fine-being-attacked-isolation-houston-rockets
"No they didn't ""need"" anything, they would have been a top 2 team in the league (and the only way they are 2 is if horford went to okc and kd stayed). The only difference is they would be in the same tier as the other top teams.  People forgot how fucking good Stephen Curry is. This man could legitimately win mvp the last 2 years if kd wasn't sharing the spotlight.  And he might not be kd, but he is a phenomenal iso player. Play out the 2016 finals 10x and the warriors win it 9.  But that 10% outcome happened, and it was amazing. But now we're stuck with another 5 years of no competition and robbed of seeing one of the greatest offensive talents in history go nuclear for more than 2 games in a row (because every time he does, the entire 4th becomes garbage time)  "
"1. There was internet, it just wasn't as amazing as it is now. Here's Yahoo announcing [the Bulls win in 1997] (https://web.archive.org/web/19970614082130/http://www6.yahoo.com:80/)      2. Even though there was no social media there was still ESPN and sports radio driving narratives.        3. Instead of talking sports with strangers online, you talked about with your friends in real life.       4. It is absolutely comparable. The Warriors would have been despised back then as much as they are now. Meanwhile people loved the Bulls, and loved Michael Jordan (unless you were a fan of the teams he killed, like the Jazz).      And to be clear, Stephen Curry was probably one of the most universally admired basketball players since MJ--until KD arrived and things went sideways. Draymond being one of the least likeable players in the league has also hurt.   "
"Might as well rename them Golden State And1 Street Basketball:   Lebron ""The Main Event"" James  Stephen ""Hot Sauce"" Curry   Klay ""The Professor"" Thompson  Kevin ""Half Man Half Amazing"" Durant"
Okay but Klay Thompson played like Stephen Curry so it's all good. 
"Yeah I mean I'll certainly never count however many rings he ends up with.  It was a fortunate situation in just about every aspect. The salary cap took a huge boom the season after GS signs Klay and Draymond to essentially half-max deals while still having league MVP Stephen Curry on the worst contract in the league for one extra season.  That will never be replicable by another franchise. So the rings argument will just fall short for KD. I'll still count the rest of GS, though, they were obviously the best team before snek joined, so who's to say they don't deserve their success."
"Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Iger proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Kevin Durant and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Monday Night. Injured forward Patrick McCaw yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Stephen Curry gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Klay Thompson yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Durant hit the locker room door, former NBA great Anderson Varejao hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"

"Honestly, I know NY fans may not want him and a lot of r/NBA thinks he'll be a bust, but it'd be so much fun if he actually did pan out and became the star point guard for the Knicks. If he actually panned out to be Stephen Curry-lite especially after the Knicks thought they'd be getting the actual Steph than it'd be such a fun media circus."

He shot 260 three's in the 95-96 season and made over 42% of them. That is close to some of the best three point percentages we see today from players like Stephen Curry, who is well known for his great three point shooting.

"Scorer: that doesn’t explain the massive gulf in efficiency.    Ballhandler: there is no objective metric for ballhandling, but that doesn’t mean one can’t be clearly better than the other.  If you’re going to sit there and actually try and contest that Stephen Curry is the better ballhandler, then I have to question your ability to evaluate talent.    Passer: no, I’m telling you that Robertson and Curry are neck and neck in passing when you actually normalize for context.  But I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that a Big O fan thinks box score stats are the most important thing in basketball.  Bet Westbrook jumped into your top 3 after the last two years huh?  And no, you haven’t given me “lots”.  Look back at our conversation.  All you’ve done is idly contradict things I’ve said without raising any actual points about why you think Big O is better.  Seriously.  Find me a time when you replied to me with anything but contradicting my arguments and calling me a homer.  Edit: In fact, I'll do it for you.     First comment: &gt;....do you not know about Stockton and Robertson?  &gt;Because Stockton is at least on par with curry and Robertson is at least a tier above.  &gt;Edit: and what do you know, I’m not alone in my thoughts on this  Here's where you first claim Curry is at least a tier below Robertson.  Second comment:  &gt;I can when we’re comparing players and you bring in team accomplishments and subjective voting metrics in an objective conversation. Lol  &gt;By your logic, Bill Russell is the best player to ever play the game.  Here all you do is contradict what I say without introducing a single argument for Robertson.   Third Comment  &gt;Holy shit you’re a homer that doesn’t know lol.  &gt;I’ll bite: how is Curry a better scorer than Robertson? How is curry a better ball handler? How is curry a better passer?  &gt;Go ahead and provide solid metrics to prove those points that don’t hinge on your opinion lol.  You call me a homer and ask me to explain myself.  Still no points raised.  Next comment:  &gt;Scorer: lol at you ignoring that Oscar didn’t get an extra point opportunity anytime in his career.  &gt;Ball handler: eye test isn’t an objective metric.  &gt;Passer: so you’re telling me Robertson is a better passer even when you do everything you can to discount his stats?  &gt;Also, I’ve given you lots. You just ignore it because Steph is your idol.  Again, just contradicting my arguments and calling me a homer."

"I have a theory that some hate Curry, because he wasn't part of their narrative. It was suppose to be Chris Paul...it was suppose to be Russell Westbrook....it was suppose to be James Harden. When fans think of an NBA , they don't think of a smaller guard with limited athleticism who can shoot well from the floor.  Yes, he had a ""softer"" upbringing than those guys, but coming from a similar background, I see so many kids from privilege who don't know the meaning of discipline or hard work. There are aspects of being an elite athlete that are genetic and some have natural talent. But talent is overrated, the only thing that matters is being willing to adapt and work on your craft. Stephen Curry is an elite player and has shown it time and time again. Ignore his skin tone, body or boyish looks...and focus on the play. "
Stephen Wardell Curry II
"Comparing stats across generations is useless.   For example, if Stephen Curry was born when Larry Bird was born, he wouldn’t have grown up shooting as many threes, his coaches wouldn’t have allowed him to shoot so many threes, he wouldn’t of been drafted number 7, and he might not have been a starter until year 3 or 4 (like Steve Nash).  On the other hand, if Larry Bird was born when Curry was born, he would’ve had Curry to look up to growing up, he would’ve had Steve Nash to look up to growing up, he would’ve been able to look up to Dirk...therefore, Bird would’ve been shooting a crap load more threes growing up, practicing more half-court shots, and there is no telling how good that Larry Bird would have become.  Same thing with LeBron and Jordan. If you flip their time periods, there’s no telling what would’ve happened. They might’ve made LeBron play power forward.   Who knows who Kobe would’ve emulated without MJ to look up to."
simmons dunn and ball aren't better at anything than stephen curry
Defense. Consistency. Reliability. Low-injury hardiness. Playmaking. Passing. Fundamentals.  And then there's longevity. Proof of what a player can do is more convincing than presumption. Put it this way: Would you rather have Stephen Curry for 9 years or John Stockton for 19?
"Let's go through them and take a look. Keep in mind that the games come out a year before \(2k18 came out in 2017, 2k17 in 2016, etc\).  2000\-2004 \- Allen Iverson: Did not get traded any of the years he was a cover athlete.  2005 \- Ben Wallace: Got traded two years later.  2006\-2007 \- Shaquille O'Neal: Got traded two years after his second stint as cover athlete.  2008 \- Chris Paul: Did not get traded in conjunction with being a cover athlete.  2009 \- Kevin Garnett: Did not get traded in conjunction with being a cover athlete.  2010 \- Kobe Bryant: Did not get traded in conjunction with being a cover athlete.  2011 \- Michael Jordan: Retired at the time of release.  2012 \- Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson: Retired at the time of release.  2013 \- Blake Griffin, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose: None of them were traded in conjunction with being a cover athlete.  2014: \- LeBron James: Was traded a year after being a cover athlete.  2015: Kevin Durant \- Was traded two years after being cover athlete.  2016: \- Stephen Curry, James Harden, Anthony Davis: None of them were traded in conjunction with being cover athletes.  2017 \- Paul George: Was traded a year after being cover athlete.  2018 \- Kyrie Irving: Was traded a year after being cover athlete.  Let's be generous and state that cover athletes that were traded within two years \(so completing the regular season during which they were cover athlete, and being traded during the next one\) are our cut\-off.  That would mean that the cover athletes for 2k5, 2k7, 2k14, 2k15, 2k17 and 2k18 were traded after being cover athletes, for a total of 6 athletes, while the cover athletes for the other 13 games, a total of 14 athletes,  were not traded in conjunction. So going by this statistic, I guess LeBron has an almost 40&amp;#37; chance of staying in Cleaveland for at least one more season.  But if we narrow it down further, because going by the OP LeBron would be leaving this summer, meaning he'd leave just before being a cover athlete for 2k19, the statistics tell a different tale. No cover athlete has ever left their team to join a different one in the summer before the release of their game, only after release. So unless LeBron does the unprecedented, this would indicate that he doesn't leave until at the very least the middle of next season.  I'm excited for the future of NBA 2K cover athlete soothsaying."
Why are you trying to argue about something that's very easily disprovable lmao?

"Did you know apparently an article from some newspaper in Salt Lake City described Curry as ""rude for embarassing Gobert"" with that spin cycle.  Edit: [Here](http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=5257791&amp;itype=CMSID) we are, ""Stephen Curry was particularly rude, turning Gobert into an internet meme with a few crossovers that threw him off balance in the series opener."" It's from the Salt Lake Tribune."
The brilliant shooting from Stephen Curry continues
"Well among all point guards, Stephen curry ranks number 26 out of 103 guards in defensive real plus minus, with a plus 0.21.  For reference, Rudy Gobert has a DRPM of 5.12, Robert Covington has a 4.3 DRPM, and Carmelo Anthony has a -1.24 DRPM. So Curry is an average defensive player, but an above average defensive PG."
"Stephen Curry makes 3-pt shot from 32 ft (GSW 121, OKC 118)"

"Could've easily found it yourself, but [here you go](https://streamable.com/pp5ec) - and the [article explaining the issue](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23690870/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-shrugs-exchange-kendrick-perkins-cleveland-cavaliers)  Technically didn't move in his way, but that's not what anyone claimed."
"Max Kellerman is my top pick.  I mean, the dude just straight up said Stephen Curry doesn't deserve finals MVP."
"Stephen ""Aragorn"" Curry"
"I found an article with a video that covers clearly both front and rear views of that shot:  [Steph’s 9 Threes!](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/article/2018/06/04/stephen-curry-launches-three-point-barrage-record-fashion-help-golden-state)   On closer inspection, especially from the rear view... even though Kevin Love comes in hot, he actually (very narrowly) avoids contact to the legs. If anything, Steph falling over has more to do with him just going backwards himself rather than from Love’s “contact”.   You can also see his feet are well set when he takes the shot, then his body goes into a small V shape mid-air (which made me think about kicking feet, charge, etc).  I see other comments here saying that you have to give a shooter room to land... but I don’t think that applies to this case because of his mid-air body repositioning.  If you look at some of his other 3 pointers he took that night, his body was more vertical coming down from his jump shots, meaning he lands more naturally. Even with ones he had D on him.  I dunno, I just don’t think that was the right call to make. But at the same time, from the refs angle I could see that perhaps he thought he saw contact."

KD is the better defender, and arguably a more consistent scorer, but thats about it.  I think Steph has a bigger impact on his team, as evidenced by how the Warriors didn't really miss a beat when KD was out in January this year, or when he missed the last few months of the season in 2017, but their offense became much worse when Steph was out in December of 2017.

"Stephen Curry played a season shooting 45% from three on 11 attempts per game, making over 400. No one has even came CLOSE to that. As of now there is no coherent argument for him not being the best shooter of all time. "
"Like I posted in another thread.  **Regular season**  Curry owns the regular season record for most 3s in a game (13), as well as most 3s in a season (he actually owns 4 of the 5 seasons with most 3s made). He has scored 402 (INSANE), 324, 286, 272 threes in different seasons. Ray Allen's career best is 269. Not only is Curry more of a volume shooter, but he is also a much more efficient 3 pt shooter than Ray Allen. Curry is a career 43.6% three point shooter (4th best all-time) while Allen is a 40% career three point shooter (43rd best all-time). The only shooters with a better percentage than Curry were non-volume shooting role-players (like Steve Kerr) so that's not nearly as impressive. Ray Allen still owns the record of most career regular season threes made (2,973), but it took him 1,300 games to reach it. Curry is currently 7th on the all-time list (2,129), but it took him just 625 games to reach it. By the time Curry plays 1,300 games he will be at over 4,000 threes made.  **Playoffs**  All-time playoff leaders in threes made  * Ray Allen, 385 threes (171 games, 40.1%) * Stephen Curry, 370 threes (88 games, 41%) * LeBron James, 369 threes (236 games, 33.2%) * Manu Ginobili, 324 threes (218 games, 35.8%) * Reggie Miller, 320 threes (144 games, 39%) * Klay Thompson, 300 threes (100 games, 40.9%) * Kobe Bryant, 292 threes (220 games, 33.1%) * Derek Fisher, 285 threes (259 games, 39.9%) * JR Smith, 282 threes (128 games, 36.9%) * Paul Pierce, 276 threes (170 games, 35.5%)  It will take Curry less than 95 career playoff games to break Allen's playoff record (reached in 171 games), and he's doing it at a better percentage. Curry also owns the record for most threes in the finals, as well as most threes in a finals game.  All of this, while Curry gets double-teamed much more than Ray Allen did.  The gap between Steph Curry and Ray Allen when it comes to 3 point shooting is MASSIVE. Allen is not in his league.

I love a Stephen Curry 
Because the media is stupid. Why would you ask the warriors? Because they want to hear something where they can make a headline: „STEPHEN CURRY THINKS JR ISN‘T NBA CALIBER“. Something like that. That’s exactly why they ask all these questions. Sometimes not even game related. It’s hard to find quality interviews nowadays. 
"&gt; Yeah cause was Curry really that good with Mark Jackson?   Actually, the dubs had like a 33-5 record or something when they had a #FullSquad in 2014 under Jackson, so it’s not like they weren’t showing signs of their 73 win team brilliance, it’s juss that they couldn’t get healthy that season under Jackson.   &gt; Not denying Curry is really good but he wouldn’t be 2 time MVP without the system Kerr implemented  That’s so dumb tho. You’ve watched Stephen Curry play, right? You’ve seen him hit 30 footers running full speed off the dribble over 2 dude’s face ? You’ve seen him constantly get double teamed, on and off the ball, which open up looks for his teammates and get them to score? You’ve seen him crossing over and pulling up, no matter who’s in front of him? Is Kerr forcing Steph to do those things? Is Steph’s talent and scoring ability a product of some X’s and O’s?? Like, I shouldn’t even have to bring up how much worse and stagnant the offense gets when Steph is on/off the court and how our +/- and record jump out the window when he’s playing. And that the dubs went 24-0 and 12-0 in the playoffs when Kerr wasn’t even coaching. And that he’s a FIRST-YEAR COACH WITH ZERO EXPERIENCE and you’re giving him more credit for turning a franchise around than a guy who has the two most efficient regular seasons in NBA history and is statistically the most efficient scorer in playoffs history, and is probably the most efficient, prolific scorer right now.

"Calling someone else's arguments subjective while not actually making a substantial counter\-argument is in effect avoiding the argument. And I don't believe you have made a substantial counter\-argument. You claim it's just because you're trying to keep things as objective as possible, but you're doing so to the point of being reductive. Basketball is too complex to be evaluated without any subjectivity, at least as you seem to be defining subjectivity, and your refusal to do so seems like a deliberate refusal to engage in a real argument and try to claim victory by default.  For example, your statement right here: ""Let us follow your ""nearly"" won logic and say in an alternate reality nearly is the same as winning."" No, let's actually not do that, because it's completely unnecessary and not at all the point of the ""nearly winning"" context... and I feel like you know that. Winning and losing are binary outcomes. No one is arguing this point. But given that the Finals play out in a seven game series packed with strategic adjustments, do you honestly believe there's no difference between losing in OT after several extremely unlikely occurrences go against you, and losing by a more substantial margin?   If you're a basketball coach and you just won a game at home that you were heavily favored to win because of a changed call, a missed free throw, and an opposing player not knowing what the score was, are you thinking ""Yep, everything according to plan""? Hell no \- you're thinking that you need to make changes or find ways to play better because you cannot possibly rely on such a combination of events to bail you out again. Or maybe this is another ""subjective"" point you're going to dodge instead of just acknowledging \(or at least properly arguing\) the fact that this was an extremely improbable win for the warriors rather than a win that suggests a reliably superior system and game plan.   Or how bout this one: ""There are opposing systems at work that supply context that must be willfully ignored to maintain this “stellar” performance narrative that you’re espousing."" There are actually opposing *rosters* at work that must be willfully ignored to maintain this ""LeBron is responsible for the Cavs system, which is responsible for his team losing"" narrative that you're espousing. Do you honestly believe that George Hill, Kevin Love, and Tristan Thompson are comparable complements to Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green? Because to suggest LeBron is at fault for the inferior system causing the Cavs to lose requires you to believe the difference in system is the only reason the Warriors won, that LeBron's teammates have no impact on the design of the system, or have no impact on the outcome of the game other than their complicity in the inferior system.   Actually, it's your totally *subjective* opinion that the system has anything to do with the Cavs' losing. There's just as strong an argument to be made that given their current roster construction, this system is the best way for the Cavs to play and the only reason the game was even close, or that the Cavs made it this far in the first place. Now, you can go ahead and point out that they still lost so it doesn't matter the game was close because the end result is the same, but again, you'd be pretending that LeBron and the system he is at the center of shoulder 100&amp;#37; of the responsibility of that, which is subjective and backed up with zero support other than ""They lost, and LeBron is the driver of their system, therefore LeBron is at fault for the loss and cannot have played well."""
"&gt; If you want them to get a call wrong you don’t get to say you want fairness in officiating. That’s dumb as shit.   You don't get to change the rules of when a call can be reversed in the interest of ""fairness"". It isn't dumb as shit. There are rules for when things can be reviewed and rules for when things can not.  Lets review:   1) The call was for a charge on KD  2) In order to legally review said charge, the refs claimed they needed to see if he was in the restricted area  3) Lebron James was about 4 feet outside and in front of the restricted area  4) Due to Lebron James NOT being anywhere remotely close to the restricted area, the refs should not have been able to change a charge call into a block.    They effectively abused a ""loophole"", or more to the point, blatantly lied to exercise a review and reversal of a charge 36 seconds into the closing of the game. A reversal that would in fact, change the outcome of the game.   ------  And to be honest, **it doesn't end there.** If you continue watching after this colossal fuckup, and I encourage you to re watch the final minute of the game; after the block/charge fuckery, James drove back down to the other end and clearly was hit on a layup that he scored – but a foul was not called. Then, at the other end, Stephen Curry got a foul on his own drive that he converted.. He hit the free throw, setting up the final sequence of regulation.  What you think is fair, and what is actually fair, is at the very least, subjective. I don't care to get into semantics with you, but there's a reason this is arguable and extremely controversial. You don't get to play arbiter here and tell us all what's fair and what isn't and claim that we just wanted the call to be ""wrong"".    "

I realize these articles are a little outdated now, but it just seems like a reach at this point to bluntly say top 15.  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/02/09/michael-jordan-lebron-james-stephen-curry-nba-greatest  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/ranking-the-25-greatest-players-in-nba-history-100716  *At this point* I don't see them being better than the likes of:  &gt;Jordan, LeBron, Kareem, Shaq, Duncan, Magic, Russell, Wilt, Bird, Olajuwon, Oscar, Kobe, Robinson, West, etc."
"that was unnecessary, you just had to say KD gets the benefit of the calls and he definitely has. its jarring compared to his costar stephen curry who doesnt get the whistle."
"Stephen Curry:  This has only been a problem since KD came but his lack of aggressiveness can sometimes be annoying. For example, last night he had 18 points in the first half, then proceeded to attempt only 2 FGs in the 3rd quarter(which is supposed to be his quarter lol). Also, he has a tendency to commit stupid turnovers but he’s improved in that department lately."
"Stephen ""JJ Barea"" Curry"
"So refs are the reason why LeBron didn't attack in the clutch. Dude had Stephen Curry on him in the post over and over again in the final stretch and didn't attack and instead settled for a pass to his alleged ""garbage teammates""... Shouldn't of been George Hill at the line at the end of the game, should be the best player on the court.   So rather LeBron got clamped or LeBron just deferred in the fourth as usual. Because I didn't see any bad calls in LeBron's favor. The blocking foul, LeBron stepped into position while Durant was already on his drive. Clean and LeBron even goaltended Curry at the end of OT.  It's Finals basketball it was physical both ways, just Warriors were more aggressive so they obviously get the benefit of the whistle from the ref. Been like that since the beginning of basketball. "
"I'm sick of the constant complaining of refs these playoffs first of all. Second of all I find it funny how LeBron is talking shit to Curry after he blocked him (which was a goaltend) at the end of the game when they just lost by 10.  And lastly, sure LeBron scored 51 but where was he in OT and where was he in the final stretch. Dude had 6'3 Stephen Curry on him in the post several times down the stretch and didn't attack, instead he passed it. That's not clutch IMO and how are you gonna bag George Hill for missing a free throw when it should of been LeBron at the line down the stretch... the best player on the team. "
"Not sure, the video I had only had his makes.  Here's what ESPN Stats &amp; Info Tweeted out though:  * LeBron James is shooting 6-26 (19%) when guarded by Stephen Curry in his Finals career, including 2-5 with a turnover in OT on Thursday. * (In OT) - Held LeBron James to 0-4 FG, all defended by either Curry or Durant.  Someone with Second Spectrum access will probably drop some more stats tomorrow in their articles. "
"The gap isn't that large. People need to keep in mind this is only 1 game.  Since 2014-2015, here are the key guys stats in the playoffs:  * Lebron James - 30.6 Points on 57.8 TS%, 9.8 rebounds, 8.2 assists. * Stephen Curry - 26.8 Points on 61.8 TS%, 5.6 rebounds, 5.9 assists * Kevin Durant - 28.6 Points on 59.7 TS%, 7.3 rebounds, 3.9 assists  It's hard to say that there's much of a gap at all. Curry is probably the best scorer of the bunch. He has less volume (almost entirely a product of playing less minutes), but his efficiency has been significantly better than Lebron's.   Lebron and Steph are probably pretty close in terms of playmaking, and both are better than Durant.   Lebron has the highest offensive rating of 117, followed by Durant 116, and Curry 115.   Lebron has been the best defender of the group at 103, followed by Curry at 104, and then Durant at 105.  Curry is actually tied with Giannis as the 2nd best defender by defensive rating among the 20 PPG playoff scorers during this time period, despite having a poor defensive reputation.  Overall, Lebron edges Curry for the best, with Durant slightly below Curry. "
Stephen Curry did what you would expect the greatest shooter and 2x MVP / NBA Champion to do in this game. Not deserving of any extra attention 
Lebron has to carry the Cavs against:  &gt;CoTY Steve Kerr  &gt;2 time MVP Stephen Curry  &gt;1 time UNANIMOUS MVP Stephen Curry  &gt;A 3 point shooting champion  &gt;A 2 time 3 point shooting champion  &gt;The greatest 3 point shooters of all time  &gt;73-9 win supporting roster  &gt;The greatest shooting back court of all time  &gt;The 2 time DPoTY runner up and 1 time DPoTY winner  &gt;6'11.5ft MVP + FMVP   &gt;2 MVPs in their primes together  But now also:  * 3 refs  * 2018 GSW FMVP J.R. Smith dressed as a Cavalier
Because Stephen Curry plays for the Warriors.
I mean after Jordan you got Kobe... and Chamberlin... and Stephen Curry /s

"Ive been a fan of Stephen Curry ever since I saw him in his first 3 pt Shootout, but I cant say that now without getting looks or arguments erupting. "
1 - Trade Joe Johnson for Stephen Curry  2 - Trade Josh Smith for to Minnesota for a First Round Pick  3 - Trade Jamal Crawford for a First Round Pick  4 - Tank the entire Season  5 - Use multiple Picks to Draft Klay &amp; Kawhi Leonard  6 - Tank one more Year  7 - Draft Beal &amp; Trade him to Sacramento for a 1st Round Pick  8 - Use Sacramento pick in 2013 to Draft Giannis      
Lol who is that Stephen Curry guy? wtf?
List of Bay Area legends:  - Stephen Curry - Trevor Ariza - JR Smith - Zaza Pachulia's foot
Does this mean the king’s stephen curry is coming out of rotation?
"Stephen""i have no FMVP""Curry shooting 8-21 8-20 and 6-19 in three straight cloesout games did it for them."
So apparently Stephen Curry isn’t a top ten draft pick lmao 
Wardell Stephen Curry II - great attention to detail
"One can make all sorts of statements backed up by a sample size of one game, I was referring more to real statistics that tell us something.   For example, points per possession when he goes left vs right, or his tendencies when driving in either direction.  Stephen Curry had a game where he went 0/11 from three. If I was to make an argument that he is a bad 3p shooter, and then refer people to that one game, the argument would contain both the statement and the ""evidence"", but it would hold zero ground.  In the same way, just saying that Lin can't go right and than providing film of one game where he was unsuccessful with it is very unsubstantiated."
"no, that's not true. they have to have played for the same team the entire time, or be on their rookie contract and be traded. see: [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/12/15/a-deeper-look-inside-the-nbas-new-collective-bargaining-agreement/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.27603af360e7)  from the article ""And this crucial stipulation: He has to be on the team that drafted him or has to have been traded on his rookie deal to another team. That means players like Stephen Curry, DeMarcus Cousins, Russell Westbrook, John Wall and Gordon Hayward are eligible for this exception, while Kevin Durant is not.""   also, how would that make any sense if you could only get it after your 10th year. curry has a supermax but he hasn't been in the league for 10 years. players need to be entering or just completed their 8th or 9th year, but that's not the only thing that makes them eligible for it. there's other requirements they have to meet. "

Cant spell Wardell Stephen Curry without Nephew
Stephen Curry &amp; Seth Curry: The REAL splash bros 
And plus they might add Stephen Curry and KD coming off the bench. That team would be deadly. 
"That block by Raymond on Steph when he had 50+ points is something I’ll always remember. The warriors were just starting to realize what they could be, Steph was lights out, and in the final minutes we needed a stop to hurt Curry’s confidence. Felton came up big and sealed the victory for us with a huge block on a Curry jumper.   And [here](http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Stephen+Curry+Golden+State+Warriors+v+New+oKCra12hOB6l.jpg) it is."
"Wrong. He is not better or greater than Jordan. The words you are looking for are ""more talented"". Just like how Russell Westbrook is ""more talented"" than Stephen Curry but not necessarily a better player."
"Kobe averaged at least 25/5/5 in 7 seasons, which trails LeBron (14!!), Oscar Robertson (9), and Michael Jordan (8).  Among active players not named LeBron, we've got James Harden (4), Kevin Durant (3), Russel Westbrook (3), Dwyane Wade (2), Stephen Curry (2), and Demarcus Cousins (1).  So, LeBron has 14 seasons of 25/5/5, and all other active players have 15 seasons of 25/5/5.  But somehow you call that averaging a Kobe smh..."
"James Harden, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook etc. play 2 ways now? Get the f outta here "
"Am I crazy or did he just ""leaked"" a future Stephen Curry episode?   At 20:49 when talking about athletes in the show. Even slowed down I hear Stephen Curry. Season finale? "
Lebron James   Kevin Durant   Anthony Davis   Stephen Curry   Kawhi Leonard   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Giannis   (Healthy) DeMarcus Cousins   Joel Embiid

Stephen Curry to the Knicks or Timberwolves What if the Cavs didn't select Anthony Bennett What if my social anxiety was gone? 
"              It was fourth quarter, with less than ten seconds left and Golden State was down by 2. T h e arena was so loud, that Steph couldn’t hear his own thoughts.          He calmly walked the ball up the court and saw Russell waiting for him at the half court line, watching him intently with his eyes. Once Steph reached half court, he quickly passed the ball to Kevin and once Kevin touched the ball, every fan in the arena instantly booed.          "" CUPCAKE! CUPCAKE!” everyone chanted in the stands. Kevin calmly dribbled the ball and watched as his former teammate, Andre Roberson, checked him.          After passing the ball, Steph ran straight through the lane and took a screen from Draymond. Russell bumped into Draymond and then hurriedly moved to catch up to Steph, but this was enough space to give the sharpshooter room.          Kevin dribbled the ball to the top of the key and Andre followed. He gave him a quick in and out with the ball and then passed it to Steph once he saw him open. Steph caught the ball in the corner behind the three point line and quickly released it in the air. Russell moved to contest the shot, but was too late.         The clock was running down as the ball sailed to the basket. Steph had landed and watched as the ball moved in the air. He closed his eyes and silently prayed that the ball would sink in the net. When he heard the buzzer go off, he opened his eyes and saw the ball rattle in the hoop. The whole Warriors bench stood and watched. BUZZZZZ!!!!!        ""  WOOOOO!!!!!” Steph yelled excitedly. He raised his arms in the air as Thunder fans booed. The team was running onto the floor to hug him and celebrate the game winner. Thunder players were shaking their heads at the sudden lost and standing in disbelief. Steph continued to stand confidently as Kevin was the first to reach him. He put his forehead to Steph’s and yelled.       “ YEAH!” Kevin yelled out loud. He brought a hand to Steph’s head and smiled. Steph looked in his eyes and smiled, too. At that moment, Steph focused solely on Kevin and wanted nothing more than to kiss him. Kevin was leaning close to him, so Steph leaned up and kissed him.            It went silent in the arena, every fan either stopped cheering or booing and watched as Stephen Curry kissed Kevin Durant.

"I think Shaq is the only player in NBA history who could sway the game's meta. Even if he didn't shoot threes, his positives would outweigh his negatives. Probably being able to dominate and have a 75% FG (and would only need above 60% to beat a 40% 3 point shooting team) as the most unstoppable player in the NBA, he would have the same gravity as Stephen Curry, with smaller bodies, and blackhole towards the rim instead of away from it.       Who can beat a team with two black holes pulling on the exact opposite ends of the floor.    "
Thought it was Stephen Curry at first lmao
It's certainly possible that it could be LeBron but right now I still think the more likely scenario is Stephen Curry
"Nope, you're absolutely [wrong](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-stephen-curry-on-the-finals-i-wasnt-100-percent-but-who-cares/)/  &gt;""I wasn't 100 percent, but who cares? I was playing,"" Curry said. ""I was out there trying to help my team win and that's all that really matters. I've taken advantage of the summer to get right and I still have a little bit of work to go.""  Ok so you'll change your opinion now right? And admit that you owe the only championship in the history of your franchise to a wet spot on the floor in Houston? Or are you gonna try to pull some more mental gymnastics to further delude yourself?"

"Personal opinion aside, I'd rank Curry alongside Chris Paul. Stephen is the fulcrum of a potentially top-three team of all time, and we'll probably never see how effective he is outside of a system tailor-made for him to thrive. I would argue, though, that whatever he's lacking in his point-guard game he makes up for how he impacted the modern game. He may not be marshalling his team's offense like Chris does, but he controls it in his own off-ball, defense-dragging way.  Chris is.. well, we call him Point God for a reason. He dictates (emphasis on what dictating actually means) his team's offense. He's been Point God in any of the teams he played in, and however skewed his current value is (that contract bends reality), he is just that good.  At most, I got Curry on 5, Chris on 4, Kidd on 3, Steve Nash at 2, and Magic at 1.  What do you think?"

The Heat won 47 games wtf are you talking about? Some revisionist ass history. It would be like if the current Pelicans added Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler and there was no other team in the NBA with even 2 top 10 scorers on a single team.
They should give Stephen Curry an award for taking in the special needs children and playing basketball with them. 
I would say this is just a video of a man who had a premonition about how many championships Stephen Curry was going to win.
"Yeah well the flair is really just Stephen Curry as he's my favorite player and the first player I liked/was drawn to next to Kobe when I first started watching basketball around 2012. The way the flairs work they put the [GSW] If it was my choice it wouldn't be there, that's why I have the NBA logo as my flair."
you hover over it and it says [GSW] Stephen Curry  Not sure if you have noticed it or not but either way it's essentially a warriors flair
"Just googled it, you mean this?  &gt; Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words.  &gt; ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  &gt; ""I don't really listen to comparisons,"" Simmons said. ""You can compare players and whatever it is, but at the same time, everybody is their own player.""  &gt; ""Coming off a broken foot is definitely not an edge, but people are always going to say what they want to say,"" Simmons said. ""But at the end of the day, this is my first year in the league. If you're a guy coming from overseas, you're still a rookie and you can be 30 years old. So there's a rule in there.""  &gt; ""Who would I pick? Me, 100 percent,"" Simmons told ESPN at the Ritz-Carlton in downtown Philadelphia on Saturday.  &gt; ""I think I have been playing solid all year,"" he continued. ""If you look at the numbers, you will see. People who know the game know.""  &gt; ""He put me in position as the point guard, and I don't think he thought it would work out this well as it has,"" Simmons said. ""I think it is a lot of credit to Coach for sticking me in that position and trusting me.""  &gt; And although the Rookie of the Year award may be the first personal goal he would like to obtain, he has loftier goals in sight.  &gt; ""Championships,"" Simmons said. ""I want to be the Defensive Player of the Year ... MVP.

Faith in himself, competitive, lofty goals, but credit your coach, object to direct comparisons, just say you're chasing the greats. ""No other rookie impressed me"" is twisting his words."

Bulls - MJ  Cavs - LeBron  Bucks - Kareem  Celtics - Bill Russell  Lakers - Magic Johnson  Spurs - Tim Duncan  Rockets - Hakeem  Kings - Oscar Robertson  76ers - Dr. J  Pistons - Isiah Thomas  Gets tough here  Warriors - Stephen Curry (Has he passed Rick Barry yet?)

"This is a two part post. I'm posting it two parts because it was too long to post one part. Please don't respond to the 1st before reading the 2nd. 2nd is just below the 1st, I responded to myself.  &gt; It doesn't matter if you can make the cross court pass if the guy catching it isn't a threat. A shooter is still a threat regardless if you think the ball handler can make that pass. That's why teams are more reluctant to help off of great shooters.  I still maintain that skip passes are as at least as important. It doesn't matter the guy is a wide open Stephen Curry if the ball handler can't make one of the hardest passing types in the game.  Another way to argue against your position is that Thibs era defensive trends gradually died, loading up on the strong side happens way less now but outside shooting is still emphasized which goes on to prove that the two aren't nearly as related as skip passing and strong side load up. Thibs era defense was from late 2000s to early 2010s anyway. While outside shooting boom happened from mid 2010s, even if there was always gradual increase since the 3pt line was implemented.  &gt;So clearly we're gonna need to go over the film here. Outside of a few elite defensive teams I don't believe this was the norm back then. I'll even let you pick the games. top 10ish defense regular season.  This one isn't about the defender's level or the team's, the point is entirely about the offensive center's location. Well, unless the defensive C is as bad as Jahlil Okafor on defense.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ldhqxR2qw0 Nuggets Dikembe was the first to come to my mind for whatever reason. Let's take a look, shall we?  Keep in mind I'm doing all instances where absence of defensive 3 secs affected the rotation, defense, etc. not just the ""dunker spot"" argument.  10:08 Dikembe is taking staying away from Malone, risking his shot, active hands to bother the pass and is in the paint. As Malone stretches out to 3pt line, Dikembe helps on drive and still is in paint. Malone punishes him. Dikembe stays at the paint a total of 8 seconds.  15:01 Tyrone Corbin is on the corner 3 spot. His defender who switches onto him is able to camp at the paint. Stunts Tom Chambers while still being at the paint, returns to box-out as Corbin drops from the weakside to the rim for the OReb.   15:58 Both Mutombo and weakside defender leaves their men who are floor spacers to help on drive while camping at the paint.   16:25 watch how Jazz's WS shooters' defenders drop and stay at the paint while Corbin and Chambers space the floor.  Those defenders who defend top of the key floor spacers stay up at the FT line spot interchanging their feet every 4-5 seconds for the def 3 secs rule.  19:30 Dikembe's man doesn't even come back and he's able to camp at the paint for the transition defense until Malone comes. Then stays at Hornacek's drive path while Malone is up floor spacing. Then does the same with Stockton's closeout attack. And then with the pass to the post.   Literally happens for 4 different offensive actions in a single possession. Rudy Gobert isn't allowed to do the same without going in &amp; out of the paint.  Pause at 20:34 and look for Dikembe. Centers today can't do the same for rebounds, they have to stand a step to the left and sometimes a guard/wing attacks for the board and get it. That step makes considerable difference in those possessions because Dikembe is able to stay right in front of the rim while centers today can only come to that spot but not stay there while the main action is going on.  26:28 the Nugget who's beside Dikembe literally makes a rotation simultaneously when his man leaves the paint. His man only returns for the pass after rotation, getting open. That help, forces pass. And pass results in close-out attack. He also literally helps the closeout attack. Meanwhile Corbin (his man) returns to paint but is open. Dikembe stops guarding Malone who's outside of the paint and is getting further out to space the floor. Two players benefiting, in the same possession.  33:45 David Benoit is at the 3pt line. His defender camps at the paint. Then helps on post-up. Then still is at the paint after ""returning"" back to his man.  37:30 Benoit isn't touching the paint in the possession. While his man is always at the paint. Helping on actions, closing drive paths and passing lanes.  44:10 Benoit will slip to the dunker's spot and get the putback because his defender was trying to close Malone's drive path while Benoit was outside of the paint and the defender wasn't.  46:17 Dikembe makes the rotation to block Chambers because he sits at the paint while his man spaces the floor outside of the paint. Contemporary defensive anchors can do this too, but **usually** they have to go in &amp; out of the paint and check that situation.  56:42 Where is Malone, Where is Dikembe, how long Dikembe stays there and is able to make the rotation for the penetration. Prototypical evidence of the argument again.  12 examples, one half, one team. In retrospect picking a game against Jazz wasn't the best for me, because they used floor spacers as their bigs so those bigs never stayed at the dunker spot. But still proves the point, as the dunker spot was just one example. Clearly, illegal defense isn't called that much (which I said that anyone who doesn't know that weren't watching any older tape in the beginning of the discussion, remember?) and defenders are able to camp at the paint to defend while their men are outside of the paint.   As to how less illegal defense were called on those... As I said, anybody who watches tape regularly knows that about %40 of the defensive possessions included illegal defense in most of the 90s and at maximum 8-10 were called by a team. This wasn't the intention why I showed these of course. My intention was to show all the times where an offensive player left the paint and their defender stayed at the paint for 4-5 seconds. Pretty objective measure. Whereas ""emphasis on help &amp; recover patterns"" argument isn't since it's subjective, and no matter how many examples I can show you, you can call it ""meh"" just to defend your position. Because I'm still on the fence about whether you want to defend your position or you discuss basketball to improve knowledge, pick somebody else's brain, revise your position, etc. I love discussing basketball with the latter people because   a) discussion is more of high quality  b) since they're not dense on defending their positions, they are able to attain more basketball knowledge with constant revising and thinking, so that I'm too able to pick their brains, and revise my opinions, learn stuff from their high quality basketball thinking, as well.

This gives a 30.7% chance of drafting an All-Star with a top-10 pick (46/150). If you only look at top-5 picks, the percentage creeps up slightly to 37.3% (28/75). Most of these players have made multiple All-Star games, and there is still time for younger players drafted in the top-10 after 2012 or 2013 to develop into All-Stars, so these percentages might be an underestimate. It's obvious that the top of the draft will give you the best chance at drafting an All-Star caliber player, and the results back that assumption.   When looking at the number of All-Star games each player played in, the data show that 41.3% (19/46) of the All-Stars drafted in the top-10 only made 1 or 2 times. These types of players (Harris, Deng, Iguodala, Noah, etc.) aren't necessarily players an average fan would consider ""All-Star caliber"" but were good enough during their peaks to be selected once or twice. This percentage may be skewed a little higher than it should be as a few of the younger players taken in the 2012-2015 drafts are just entering their primes and will undoubtedly be selected to more All-Star games in the future, but this effect may also be canceled out by new players who have not yet made an ASG and are selected only once or twice in their careers.     A lot of people assume that the moniker of All-Star means that a player is a top-10 or top-15 player in the league, but the fact of the matter is that 24 players are selected as All-Stars each year, and sometimes that number is inflated due to injury replacements. In fact, out of the 46 players who were drafted in the top-10 and have been selected to the All-Star team, 47.8% (22/46) have been selected 5 or more times. I chose the cut-off of 5 ASG selections arbitrarily, but the idea behind it was that a player must be an All-Star for the better part of a decade to be considered a ""perennial All-Star."" To the average fan, these are the players people typically classify as ""All-Stars"" because they make it to the ASG year after year. This percentage might be a little low as a few players drafted between 2009-2015 still haven't made 5 All-Star games, but I would bet they do by the end of their careers (DeRozan, Lillard, Embiid, etc.). However, the total number of players drafted in the top-10 who are selected as an All-Star could increase, which would also impact this percentage.     **TL;DR**  A lot more top-10 picks become All-Stars than people think (30.7%). A good amount (41.3%) only make it to the ASG once or twice in their careers, but more (47.8%%) end up becoming ""perennial All-Star"" players that we typically think of when we talk about All-Star players."
"Stephen Curry is LeBron, but light skinned, green eyed, 5 inches shorter, about 60 pounds lighter, weaker, shoots much better, and has two girls and a boy while LeBron has two boys and a girl"
"EDIT: An eagle-eyed commenter pointed out my brain fart of no Dirk on my Top 10. Corrected.    I'd probably go something like this:  1. LeBron James 2. Tim Duncan 3. Kobe Bryant 4. Kevin Garnett 5. Shaquille O'Neal 6. Dwyane Wade 7. Dirk Nowitzki 8. Kevin Durant 9. Stephen Curry 10. Jason Kidd  Honorable Mentions (in no order): Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Tracy McGrady, Ben Wallace, Shawn Marion, Tony Parker, Ray Allen, Chris Paul, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Manu Ginobili."
"How can you say he didn’t elevate his game, when he started to blossom into a better player once Snyder came in and implemented a better coaching system? The team wasn’t built around Hayward during his time there, but he was improving and developin and became an all star And he did help you guys finally get back into the playoffs when he got better players around him.  No he was a restricted free agent, and the Jazz told Hayward to find a contract and they will match him, instead of giving him the potential 80 million max contract. He was matched by 63 million from the Hornets.  Regardless his 7th year or 3rd year he was about to enter his prime. Not everyone blossoms quickly, example again, Stephen curry. He is a late bloomer as some say, cause when he started actually producing was when he was 25 about the same age as Hayward when he left to the Celtics.   I don’t understand why Jazz fans are still upset he left. Blame the FO not the player unless he snaked his way out. "
"Gobert's +/- numbers are insane.  He's the defensive Stephen Curry.  Where some players generate a net 10 points of offense, Gobert helps your team get up 10 points through defense.    Also, the entire Jazz system is built around defense.  We'd rather win games 64 to 60 than win 120 to 114."

I need a old Colbert Report with Stephen and Esteban Curry.
Stephen “I couldn’t beat lebron with 2 other Allstars so i helped recruit another all star” Curry 
"Fact: Steph outplayed KD in every playoff series except for last year’s finals and 1 of the 4 games this finals.   Myth: Steph can’t carry teams by himself.   Fact: In 2013, Steph took a team with a core of four rookies and a sophomore Klay Thompson to the WCSF and doggone almost beat the spurs by himself. They were the only western conference team that actually challenged the spurs and didn’t get swept by them that season, and Steph had to beat a 57-win Denver nuggets team in the first round with that core, and did with a flurry of hot shooting games like we’re so accustomed to seeing today. For context, just 3 (THREE!!!) of the 32 Leastern conference teams that Lebron’s faced since forming his first super team with the Heat in 2011 had records better than the 57 win nuggets team that curry beat by himself.  Fact: this was a 2013, 24-year old Stephen curry who’s gotten A LOT better since then"
"Steph can't be having them random 5/17 games he liked to throw up and still be steamrolling through the west. Fact: without KD the Warriors lose to the Spurs in round one because Curry is lightskin Mr Glass. Fact: without KD the Warriors lose to the Rox in 6. Fact, without KD the Warriors lose to the Cavs in 2017. Fact: Without KD Stephen Curry has beaten two healthy teams in the Playoffs(Iggy was a double agent. ). I'm spitting skrait fax your way dog. But continue to hate on KD cuz your boy BonBron cant hack it without 6 all stars on his squad. "

Wardell Stephen Curry III
"&gt; Warriors: Stephen Curry*  Something something Wilt, as always."
uh  stephen curry was drafted after durant? you think tatum will be a better offensive player than fucking steph? 
"&gt; Isn't ""shot accuracy"" how you measure ""scoring efficiency""? In order to know how efficienctly a player scores don't you need to measure how many attempts they have and how many times they actually put the ball in the hoop? What is the difference between ""shot accuracy"" and ""scoring efficiency""?  Yes, vast majority of scoring efficiency is basically shot accuracy. I'm basically arguing about the remaining small margin here.   &gt;How can scoring threat affect a player's scoring efficiency? I can see how a player's scoring threat can increase the team's offensive efficiency, e.g., via gravity or breaking down defenses, etc. But how can a player's own scoring threat increase his own scoring efficiency? Edit: Can you give me a concrete example of this?  Again, TS% usually calculates majority of the scoring efficiency. But stylistically, some players fit to have better %TS through shot selection.   I'm not historically high on Iverson, for instance. But players like Iverson, Kobe are tough shot makers that TS% just slightly underrates because they  a) put pressure on the defense from all areas on the court even if Stephen Curry is a better offensive player (and much better compared to Iverson) despite not putting pressure on defense from all areas of the court and having preferred spots. Same with Shaq, LeBron, etc. who are better players, they don't put pressure all over the court, they have preferred spots. So defense gravitates towards those guys who put pressure all over the court just a bit more.  You'll notice this when great defenders talk about defending LeBron vs Kobe for instance. LeBron's the better player obviously but they always talk about how defending Kobe is harder because you can't pick your spots when defending Kobe at any second during a game whereas they talk about LeBron like they could have some strategy to against him on the floor. Doesn't change the fact that LeBron is a better offensive player, but I think %TS underrated this aspect of scoring threats that tough shot makers like Iverson and Kobe have that provides just a little more gravity for their teammates to benefit. And since they have questionable shot selection and they shoot from all over the floor, as opposed to physical specimens like Shaq and LeBron using some skill to get to their spots and take their efficient shots or a skill wizard like Curry using some physical ability to get to his spots and take efficient shots, some of Iverson &amp; Kobe's tough shots end up being 2nd opportunities for their teammates because they had that gravity due to putting pressure on D on all spots. ""Kobe assists"" are a real thing and I think this is the reason why while not being super efficient, Iverson &amp; Kobe were able to carry some offenses with a lackluster supporting cast to top 10 in the league.   b) have actual gravity due to other reasons. Examples are obviously Shaq, Curry, Nowitzki. This is more important than the above because Iverson, Kobe type of shot makers are only marginally underrated by TS% because not always their teammates are able to finish the possession when they go for a hard layup over 2 people or a tough shot over a double team. But Shaq, Curry &amp; Nowitzki's gravity are more valuable. Curry &amp; Nowitzki have special floor spacing effects, so let's say that Devin Harris - Erick Dampier runs a PnR in Dallas. Dirk spaces the floor. Harris uses the angle of the screen well and is penetrating well, so the defense needs to help. But their only help defender who'll be able to make a difference is guarding Dirk. He can't leave Dirk for an open 3. So Harris finishes the floater and makes 2 points. Let's say you don't have Dirk on the floor. You have a traditional PF. This team PF defender helps that PnR and Harris doesn't score maybe? Maybe no 2 points for Dallas. So in that hypothetical scenario, Dirk's presence is substantial to getting that 2 points. But neither his TS% or PPG is affected because he doesn't shoot nor he gets an assist since he doesn't make the pass, just is able to affect a teammate's shot openness by standing behind a line on the court. Curry is the same. Shaq's gravity is different but the same effect. Defenses and especially defenses that had literally noone to even try to go against prime Shaq in the post, usually gravitated towards Shaq, closing in on him with help defenders before he receives the entry pass to the post. Meanwhile Lakers don't pass the ball to him, he literally doesn't touch the ball for that possession, but they reverse to ball to the weakside and guesswhat, either Rick Fox hits an open 3 because his man is gravitating towards shot or Kobe catches his defender closing in on Shaq attacks at his close-out. Shaq's post gravity creates that opening but buckets go to players who make the bucket, assist goes to Derek Fisher or something. But all of this happen for Curry, Dirk and Shaq because of their scoring threat, yet neither TS% or APG or PPG is affected for them.   c) Break down of defenses. For a player to have no APG or PPG or TS% affected with this, it needs to be a hockey assist. Chris Paul breaks down the defense, passes to Redick, who passes to Crawford for extra pass who makes the open 3. Neither Redick and Crawford is able to break down the defense like Paul does after a PnR because of Paul's scoring threat, his mid-range jumper, floater, finishing at the rim. Yet he receives no assist, point, TS% isn't affected. '14 Spurs is the go-to example I guess. For an offense so potent, for so many assisted FGs made, nobody monopolized on neither PPG or APG on that team. So many shots were like: Parker starts the initial action and drives, corner shooter is open, he passes to Kawhi up top when defense closes out, who passes to Diaw on the corner when defense closes out, Diaw makes open 3. Parker is the one to break down the defense, initial open shot comes from the defense helping on his drive, finishing threat, that's his scoring threat, yet Kawhi gets the assist and Diaw the points.   So essentially, you're right that it affects the team not the player. As you said, it has a relationship with team offense, team ORTG. I'm not arguing against that. I'm arguing precisely that. That team offense, ORTG effect is important for scoring efficiency because it happens due to these scoring threats. Otherwise looking at PPG and then TS% should tell literally the %100 about a player's scoring but it shouldn't. These margins are important too, because if the defense doesn't help on Parker, Parker makes a floater and his TS% would be boosted. If PF help defender doesn't stay with Dirk, he makes an open 3 and his TS% is boosted. If defenses don't focus on tough shot makers, maybe those tough shot makers make a 1v1 shot as opposed to blatantly missing one over 2 defenders where their teammate completes the play with an OREB.   So these margins are important to me, defenses' decision making have albeit a small but absolutely have an effect on opposing players' TS%. Chris Paul doesn't have DeAndre Jordan's TS% numbers, yet he is more efficient. He's not only more efficient because he has more volume. Even if they had the same volume, and DAJ had the better TS%, Paul still would be more efficient granted if he doesn't have a bad TS%. Because Paul breaks down defenses because they respond to his scoring threat, disallow him to take an efficient shot. And yes, a lot of the times he gets an assist for that. But sometimes he doesn't even if it's his scoring threat that creates the bucket. Defenses never do that for DeAndre Jordan.   But what TS% absolutely measures, without any margin for error is the shot accuracy. Kobe &amp; Iverson's scoring efficiency might be slightly underrated because if two defensers didn't collapse on them when they take a tough layup and their teammates finishes with the putback, they might have scored 1v1 in that layup and boos their PPG &amp; TS%. However, they still took that shot. They made the decision to take that shot. And of course it's not a given that their teammate gets the putback and score off of their gravity. So they missed the shot, and TS% reflects that without any small margin for error. Their shot accuracy. "
"Hot take: Stephen Curry almost single-handedly put the traditional Center out to pasture with his style of play coupled with Kerr’s motion offense in 2014-2015, well, 2014 - present. "
Y'all think stephen curry smokes weed?
"You can do the math, I can do the math, the rest of the league can do the math, and yes, the highest-ranking members of Warriors management absolutely understand the dynamic multipliers and cascading decimal points involved in their potential salary commitments into 2018-19 and beyond.  Let’s put the big number right out on the table: Whether it’s in 2019-20, or a year or two after that, the Warriors are looking at the very real possibility — if not quite inevitability — of a $300 million annual player payout, if you count luxury-tax penalties.  (For reference: The NBA salary cap for the 2020-21 season currently is projected as $116 million.)  That’s if Warriors management wants to keep this star-studded roster together, and you can presume that for as long as the team stacks up Larry O’Brien trophies, Warriors ownership will want to keep as many of the headliners as possible for as long as possible.  S0: $300 million, possibly in a year or two. And then it could — and probably will — go even higher.  They’re not there yet, let’s be clear about that. They’ve also won three of the last four NBA championships and Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are still very much in their primes and the last three are all coming up on new free agency in the next two years.  You get what you pay for, and the Warriors’ price-tag for perennial championship contention (or potential ruination of the NBA, depending on your viewpoint) is not going to come cheap.  So I asked general manager Bob Myers a few days ago whether the Warriors can actually afford to go into such deep financial waters and whether he thinks they’ll have to.  “I feel like we’ll do whatever we can to keep winning,” Myers said on my podcast Thursday (a full transcript will be posted Monday). “And I think the players will do whatever they can to keep winning — not knowing what that will exactly look like.  “I guess it helps going into a new arena — the revenues. We’re lucky we’re supported by the fan base we are. … Working with Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Rick Welts, all the people I work with and work for, they all want to win. ..  “Our players — Draymond Green has won at every level. Klay Thompson just wants to win. Steph Curry, he goes out and recruits a guy like Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant comes here under a lot of scrutiny and faces it and overcomes it. So I think with all that combined, I’m confident we can work it out. I can’t sit here today and mathematically show you; but based on all the things I’ve seen, we’ll find a way.”  The points to underline there: Myers’ reference to Chase Center, the Warriors’ new San Francisco arena, which is scheduled to open in time for the 2019-20 season, and the nod to the players’ desire to keep this together, too.  We’ll get to the Chase Center economics in a little bit — it’s immensely significant in everything the Warriors do and plan these days.  But about the players: Give or take a few additional minimum-salary signings, the Warriors will have about $150 million in actual payroll committed for the coming season, which is way over the salary-cap line and will result in about $59 million in luxury tax — which adds up to an approximate $209 million total player-payout commitment.  And next July, Durant is eligible for a max extension (or he could leave), Thompson could be hitting free agency and Green will be one year away from free agency. That’s a lot of additional money potentially destined for three players; then you add in Curry’s ongoing super-max contract, and that’s four players who could total upwards of $130 million per season into the future. That’s how you get to a $300 million total team payout.  How are the Warriors going to deal with this?  Two words: Chase Center, which, by itself, gives Lacob and Guber access to a cash flow that few other teams in the NBA — or North American sports — have ever had. To fully tap into the money rush, though, the Warriors had to establish themselves as a premier franchise before heading into Chase, and guess what, that has happened in the last three or four years.  One thing ties into the other. It doesn’t fully work without the new revenue streams … but also the demand to watch a once-in-a-generation team play basketball.  Chase Center is a cash machine for Lacob and Guber, but remember, they’re financing the construction of the arena themselves and they probably won’t want to go too much over $300 million in any near-term season.  So to that point, they probably won’t want four max players on the roster at the same time. (They have to budget for Durant remaining at a super-max salary, even though he could choose to leave.)  The twist: there is no law that Thompson and Green have to demand the max from the Warriors. Yes, each or both might try to wring every dollar possible, and they have earned the right to ask for it, but the environment seems to point to one or both signing less-than-max extensions before hitting free agency.  “Look, we know the numbers,” Myers said. “I don’t think we’re running from those things. … (But) we’ve got a group of players and an ownership group that wants to keep it together. That’s very competitive. Both sides. You’ve heard Klay’s comments (saying he might take less than his max to stay with the Warriors). You’ve been around Draymond. He wants to keep winning. …  “We’ll keep talking about it (with Thompson). We talked about that last year (during preseason) in China, we’ll continue to talk about it. For those guys, it’s their choice. We’ll try to pay them what’s fair. And it takes two. I know and understand, they’ve gotta like the deal, too. …  “I’ll tell you this, Klay’s not driven monetarily. I think he wants to be paid fairly. I think Draymond’s the same way. And obviously Kevin, he’s shown it, that he doesn’t have to have every last penny. … I feel like if we can create a place that gives them a chance to win a championship, get paid well, enjoy going to work every day — and people think an NBA player loves going to work every day. That’s not true; maybe it should be, but it isn’t. If we can create a place where players enjoy it, the hope is they want to continue to do that.”  Now to Chase. Obviously, the Warriors are funding the $1 billion construction themselves, which is an enormous financial commitment.  But …  the whole point of building Chase was to jump this whole thing into a new financial stratosphere, and it’s happening. We’ve all heard about the Warriors’ new program — season-ticket-holders must pay substantial Chase Center membership fees for every season ticket, which will be paid back, interest-free, after 30 years. If you won’t pay the membership fee, you lose the season ticket.  Lacob and Guber could’ve hit a brick wall with this: What if nobody was willing to pay the average membership fee of somewhere between $15,000 to $20,000 per seat?  But, according to Warriors chief revenue officer Brandon Schneider, the agreement rate so far is 79 percent, a high number for any kind of personal seat license offer.  The Warriors have made presentations to about 35 percent of their season-ticket-holders — starting with the premium seats first and working up the arena. If you do the math, which I always like to do, the Warriors are looking at approximately $79 million in membership commitments already.  That’s with about 13,000 other seats left to pitch; that’s not counting the suites (which are almost sold out, Schneider said); and that’s not counting a single dollar from ticket sales, concessions or parking.  Here’s my Chase membership money worksheet: Capacity will be a shade over 18,000, which the Warriors will sell out (they have a 44,000-person waiting list once they get through all the current season-ticket-holders probably by January); figure on an $18,000 average membership price; and that gets you to … approximately $324 million in total membership cash available to the Warriors, not repayable until 2049 … and that’s without interest.  Also: The Warriors had a 94-percent season-ticket renewal rate from last season to this coming season, Schenider said, their sixth consecutive year over 90 percent, and we all know that the prices have gone up quite a bit in recent years.  More: The naming rights deal with JPMorgan Chase is estimated to be worth $20 million a year over a 20-year deal. That’s another $400 million or so.  Even more: Forbes estimated that the Warriors took in a $120 million profit last year.  Finally: The Warriors are coming up on a “reset” opportunity in a couple years with NBC Sports Bay Area, which could more than double their annual local television income, from the $30 million range to the $65 million range.  You ask, can the Warriors afford a $300 million total payroll payout in a year or two? The answer is yes. Will Chase Center be enough of a windfall to let them? The answer is yes.  And if they keep all or most of their core on the roster, and keep winning, will the players make key concessions along the way just to make sure everything stays together for as long as possible? If you do the math, you already know the answer."

"Forgot that Rubio didn’t even come over right away. Timberwolves passed on Stephen Curry in 2009, taking Rubio and Johnny Flynn back to back. Then they followed it up by giving Wiggins the max. What a terribly run organization."
"Yup, a Title is a Title and indeed injuries are part of the game. For the 2016 Finals, Bogut going down wasn't ideal along with Iguodala's back acting up and not seeing Steph at 100%. Bogut and Dre's injuries usually get sweep underneath the rug as they were the ""role"" players to the unanimous MVP Stephen Curry. That's why whenever people want to meme the 73-9 Warriors losing in the Finals, one of the first things they will always say after 3-1 is ""with unanimous MVP Curry.""   Steph may have gone into INSANE mode in the 2015-2016 season but Warriors still have a system and everyone on the Warriors still has their role. When one goes down (be it Steph, Klay, Green, Bogut or Andre), things change! We saw this in the WCF this year with Iguodala out as although he isn't an offensive threat nor an All-Star at this point in his career, his role on the team is supremely important."
Same time last year Marcus Smart was the next Stephen Curry
"I think these are all great choices, especially the Murray pick, but I'll throw out some different names just to diversify it up.  ROY - Wendell Carter. He's in an excellent position to fit into place on what's turning out to be a pretty awesome group of young guys. Lopez might make it hard for him to start off the bat, but I think he'll quickly fit into place on the squad having the athleticism and length to be an awesome center. 15 points, 11 boards, 1.5 blocks.  DPOY - DeAndre Jordan. I could see him having a come back season to make an impact right away, especially with Dallas likely to make a playoff push for what's probably Dirk's last season. I think Carlisle will be a great coach for him, and expect him to be a better version of Tyson Chandler from that 2011 squad. 16 points, 13 boards, 2 blocks.   6MOY - Rajon Rondo. I think the Lakers have to go with Lonzo as the starter despite Rondo's experience, just because as one of the central rising stars he stands to gain a ton of skill and experience getting that year in with Lebron, especially if the Lakers are looking to compete within the next couple of years. Rondo will still flourish off the bench, rotating between guard positions to lead what could be a pretty good second unit. 9 points, 10 assists, 1.6 steals.   MVP - Stephen Curry. Bias for sure, but based on what we saw early on last season and the fact that Curry is becoming more and more comfortable working the offense with Durant, I think my favorite point guard could go for another legendary season. This next season will probably be the best of this team's era and I think Curry will flourish as the clear leader of what might be one of the best teams ever assembled with the defenses thinned out enough where double teams become a lot more risky. 30 points, 2 steals, 8 assists, 5 boards on 50% fg and 46% 3-P.   Edit: also, COY - Brett Brown. I think Brad Stevens is the more likely pick, but since he's a heavy favorite I'll make the argument that Brett will be in a better position to have young players across the board grow tremendously as Philadelphia inevitably improves, perhaps even beating out Boston for the 1st seed."

Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry is on roids. Don't know how much I believe it though

Opinions can be wrong. Stephen Curry is much better than Rose ever was or could have been. 
Theres a big difference in how the game is played now than there was 4-5 years ago. Stephen Curry changed the game.
"Tbh, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, and Draymond Green immediately come to mind."
"Forwards cannot guard Stephen Curry for an extended amount of time. Anyone saying otherwise is tripping. We've seen Curry roast Kawhi on the perimeter before. Kawhi is one of the best perimeter defenders ever and he will do great relative to other *forwards*, but he will get beat. You just can't expect a 3 to defend one of the best perimeter players ever."
"Warriors staff overly coddles KD because they fear him leaving. This is said by everyone on the Warriors’ beat. Steph has more impact on the game than KD does. He scores more on better efficiency while being a much better playmaker. With Steph on and KD off this year, the Warriors had a 121.6 offensive rating and a 103.9 DRTG while they had a and a 111.8 offensive rating and a 109.3 DRTG with KD and no Steph.    The difference in the ORTGs of these units is equivalent to the difference between the Warriors and Atlanta on offense. The net rating of the Steph without KD units is better than the best team net rating, but the net rating of the KD without Steph units is about equal to Minnesota’s this past season.

"You don't seem to understand how statistics work. I'm not disputing facts, only recognizing (correctly) that your sample size is disingenuous to draw conclusion's from. If Lonzo Ball goes 5/10 from three to start the season it doesn't mean he's better than Stephen Curry because Curry has never shot over 50% over a season, it just means it's a small sample size. No one said you were cherrypicking certain years, I'm only telling you what any statistically literate person would tell you which is that comparing numbers in small sample sizes as if they mean something isn't really a valid analysis especially when ignoring all context. I'm not giving you ""ifs"" I'm literally telling you how outliers work. When a single point of data in the sample is enough to change the conclusion then your sample is prone to outliers."

If Stephen Curry did this the Warriors would still win 50 games. 
"If Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant both decided that they really want to be MVP this season, I don't think it would be out of the realm of possibility of the Warriors to get to 74 wins this season.  Outside of the Curry/Durant Warriors (which was a unique situation), I would think the 8-74 becomes more likely. "
THE BRILLIANT SHOOTING OF STEPHEN CURRY CONTINUES! WITH HIS 12TH 3 POINTER OF THE GAME!!!

"My team is run by Ernie Grunfeld, there is literally too much material.   But my least favorite decision in the Ernie era. Trading the #5 pick in the draft class that included Stephen Curry for Mike Miller and Randy Foye. Especially since we NEEDED a good PG that year. "
"without reading any replies,  a. James Harden  b. Anthony Davis  c. LeBron James  d. Kevin Durant  e. Stephen Curry  f. Lillard?  g. Kyrie Irving  h. Russell Westbrook  i. Paul George or Kawhi.

"We have years of evidence that Stephen Curry is one of the greatest basketball players to ever step foot on this planet.   The fact that some of his teammates stapad during the Finals, or the media falls for counting stats, doesn't take that away. "
"The Curry comparisons are logical to me, expecting him to be as good as Steph is unrealistic (though possible), but he plays in a similar way and will probably face having to make similar adjustments that Steph did.  And I don't think we've seen enough to say that Young is going to be one of the most overrated shooters in the league just yet. Don't forget Curry (sorry for the comparison) didn't exactly light the NBA on fire in his first Summer League:  &gt; Then there's Stephen Curry, the inverse to the Jennings equation. Even though Curry was playing for the Warriors, for whom summer league dominance seems to be a birthright, he sputtered his way through Vegas, looking overwhelmed and overmatched and at times, just plain overrated. Anyone that watched Curry in Vegas would have laughed you out of the room if you predicted he'd be Rookie of the Year runner-up.  https://www.sbnation.com/2010/7/5/1553486/nba-summer-league-orlando-las-vegas"
"&gt;Doesn't really matter when we're talking about just the Rockets. And source anyway?  [Here.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-vs-rockets-how-stephen-curry-has-become-the-elephant-in-the-western-finals/)  &gt; 30 points in 24 isolation possessions is just about Harden and CP3's average efficiency in ISO, so that's definitely ""not that bad"".  Harden and CP3 were by far the best isolation scorers last year, yes, but this is the Rockets as a whole, not just those two. To give up 125 points per 100 isolation possessions is not at all commendable.  &gt; They kept trying, but clearly it wasn't working all that great.  It *was* working. It is how the Rockets were beating them during the regular season and in the WCF. That and their defense.   &gt;We have one metric with noise saying he was good vs your unsubstantiated claim saying he was bad based on 2 games. I'm going to go with the full 7 game sample we have.  Closest defender isn't just a metric with noise. It is objectively flawed in that it attributes points scored against defenders who weren't the primary defender on a play.   "
&gt;Will we see the first 70 TS% season every from Stephen Curry this season?   &gt;We won't   It would be good if you could read
"The good thing is now all the players learned from Warriors how important they are able to shoot the ball in. It is so embarrassing to see 80% of the players don’t know how to shoot the ball. Come on, they are paid so much to play pro, lol...For this perspective, huge credit gives to Stephen Curry..."

Stephen Curry. With the rule emphasis change he is going to be unstoppable. 
&gt;Stephen Curry is the 2nd best player in the NBA.  I'm right there with you.  Mine would be:  1. KD will leave the Warriors next summer to go to the Knicks in large part because nobody on the team really likes him that much. He's that dude you've chilled with a bunch and include when you and your boys get a house after you move out of res but then it turns out that occasional dickishness is actually a pretty substantial part of his personality.   2. PG13 stayed in OKC because he does not believe in himself and doesn't want the pressure of working for LeBron or dragging around the Clippers. This is wise.   3. Before he retires LeBron plans to spend a year as a player coach and it will happen.   4. The Warriors were lackadasical against Houston and despite going 7 games Houston was never going to beat them and Golden State believed that.   5. Ingram is the only young Laker who will ever be an All Star. Maybe Kuz. Lonzo's stats are padded.   6. Denver is far and away the least interesting and most overrated team in the league. Their record is inflated by their weird home court advantage and they get hyped up by basketball nerds because they're a team casuals don't know anything about that always looks like it's on the cusp of something.   7. Thibs has become the worst coach in the NBA.

"Studying black holes may be hard for you and I, but for someone who does it for a living it probably isn't that difficult. One takes a physical gift and one a mental gift.

But, to your point, I couldn't do what Stephen Curry or Neil Tyson do, so to me they're both pretty fucking hard.  Tl;dr difficulty is subjective.

Stephen Curry is a great shooter.

I thought Denver and Utah had much more of an advantage considering the actual physical advantages of the higher altitude.  "

"Well, to be fairer, basketball is all physics using your brain and muscles as a calculator. I'm not sure if you know how hard it is to consistently hit long rang shots like a Stephen Curry. Ball size, hoop size, distance, jump height, release point, release velocity, release angle, release rotation...all have to be perfect. If everyone could do it there wouldn't be an NBA. Less NBA players than physicists lol so what's really harder?  Edit: wow I guess you really do have to end everything in /s around here. I was defending the skill it takes to play basketball while making a joke (usually inferred by an ""lol""). Sorry some people didn't get it."

"Yes, Kobe Bryant is arguably the most overrated basketball player in history. He is often ranked among the Top-Ten players of all time, which I think this is absurd. The following are the reasons I consider Kobe overrated: Kobe is NOT an All-Time Great Scorer. One of the most prevalent arguments as to why Kobe is a all-time great, is his supposedly legendary scoring ability, which is often compared to all-time great, Michael Jordan. However, lets take a closer look at this claim and show why it is flawed: Kobe has only 2 Scoring Titles. Kobe has only lead the league in points per game 2 times, in 19-year career. In comparison: Michael Jordan has done so 10 times. Wilt Chaimberlain has done so 7 times. Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson have done so 4 times. (KD has been in the NBA, less than half the time Kobe had, and has twice the number of scoring titles) Kobe has a Career Points-Per-Game Average of 25. Kobe averaged 25 PPG, over his career. This is a fantastic average, however, it does not rank among the greatest career averages. Kobe’s PPG average does NOT rank among the Top 10. LeBron’s career average is 27.2 PPG, while Kobe’s career average in the same span was 24.8. However, Kobe is generally considered a greater scorer. Allen Iverson, who is generally not considered among the greatest NBA players ever, had a career average of 26.7 PPG, also greater than that of Kobe. Kobe has had the Worst Chokes in the NBA Finals. Kobe is often ranked among the most clutch players in NBA history. This is not backed by substance, and this is evidenced in some of his NBA Finals performances over the years. 2004 NBA Finals: Game 3 vs Detroit Pistons In Game 3 of the 2004 NBA Finals, against the Detroit Pistons, with the series tied at 1–1, Kobe had arguably the worst choke of any superstar in Finals history, which led to a loss by 20 points. Kobe finished the game with just 11 Points on a terrible 30% shooting, with 3 Rebounds, 5 Assists and 4 Turnovers. 2008 NBA Finals: Game 6 vs Boston Celtics Facing elimination, with his team down 3–2 in the series, with a chance to force a Game 7 in Staples Center, Kobe, the reigning MVP of the league, choked again in one of the biggest games of his career, which led to the Lakers losing the Championship. Kobe finished the game with 22 Points on a dismal 32% shooting, with just 3 Rebounds and a pathetic 1 Assist with 4 Turnovers. 2010 NBA Finals: Game 7 vs Boston Celtics With a brilliant chance at redemption, against a Boston Celtics team that defeated his Lakers two years ago, Kobe had a chance to cement his legacy as a clutch performer on the biggest stage of all: Game 7 of the NBA Finals, at home. Yet, he choked again. Kobe finished the game with 23 Points, of which he scored 11 from the free-throw line, thanks to receiving a ridiculous 15 free-throw attempts (ahem Referees? ahem). He scored 12 Points from the field on a awful 25% shooting, with just 1 Assist and 4 Turnovers, but did have a stellar 15 Rebounds. But thanks to the Referees (The Lakers got 20 more free-throws than the Celtics), the Lakers happened to win this game and Kobe won his 5th Ring. Compare these chokes with LeBron’s Finals: Game 4 performance against the Mavericks, which sparked conversation about LeBron being a Choke-Artist. LeBron put up a measly 8 Points on 27% shooting, but had 9 Rebounds and 7 Assists, therefore having about similar production as Kobe’s in the fore-mentioned games. Kobe has only ONE Regular Season MVP (Which he didn’t really deserve). Kobe Bryant has only one regular season MVP , which is put 12 players who have more MVPs than him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has done so 6 times. Michael Jordan has done so 5 times. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson have done so 3 times. Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry have done so 2 times. Kobe Bryant did win the 2007–2008 season, but did not deserve it. Let us take a look at Kobe’s stats, compared to other players’ performances. Kobe Bryant: 28.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG, 46% FG, 36% 3P, with a record 57–25. Chris Paul: 21.1 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 11.6 APG, 2.7 SPG, 0.1 BPG, 49% FG, 37%3P, with a record 56–26. LeBron James: 30.0 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG, 48% FG, 32% 3P, with the record 45–37. Amar’e Stoudemire: 25.2 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.1 BPG, 59% FG, 16% 3P, with the record 55–27. Kobe is an Extremely Inefficient player. Kobe Bryant has an Career Field Goal Percentage of 44.7%. Kobe Bryant, despite being a versatile scorer, has thelowest field goal percentageamong the Top 15 All-Time Career Scorers. Kobe Bryant has scored a total 33,643 Points, off 26,200 Shots. In Comparison, Karl Malone has scored a total of 36,928 Points, off 26,210 Shots. Which means, Karl Malone has taken 10 more shots than Kobe Bryant, but has scored 3,285 more points. Kobe has the Most Career Field Goals Missed. Kobe has missed 14,481 Shots in his career, which happens to be 1,064 more than the next player, John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant hold the record with the Most Missed Shotsin a single game with 30 while shooting just 36% against the Boston Celtics in 2002. In the Top 100 for most field goals missed in a game, Kobe hold 25 of those spots, making for a quarter of the total. Kobe Bryant is NOT a clutch player. Kobe does have some great moments in the clutch, but individual moments do not mean he is a great clutch performer. Kobe Bryant missed the last 15 straight game-tying/go-ahead FG in final 5 seconds of 4th quarter/OT of his career, and his last game-winner was in March 2012. Kobe Bryant has a Field-Goal Percentage of 29.1%, over his career, on game-tying or go ahead shots in the last 24 seconds of a game, over his career, only making 48 out of 164 attempts Kobe Bryant has received multiple Undeserved All-Star Selections. Kobe Bryant has been selected to the All-Star Game in the years 2014 and 2016, for which he was undeserving. He received these on the basis of legacy, rather than on performance. His stats for these seasons were: In 2014, Kobe Bryant played a total of 6 games, where he averaged just 13.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG and 6.3 APG. In 2016, Kobe averaged 17.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 2.8 APG. Kobe has been gifted Multiple Championships by Referees. Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, whether knowingly or unknowingly, have been subject to some of the most blatantly rigged NBA Playoff games, in history. 2002 Western Conference Finals In Game 6, of a tight western conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, where the reigning champion Lakers were facing elimination, the Lakers received a ridiculous27 Free-Throws, in the fourth quarter, compared to the Kings’ 9. Watch the video below to see for yourself: 2010 NBA Finals In Game 7 of the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics, Kobe shot a disgusting 6 of 24 from the field. However, thanks to the 15 Free-Throwshanded to him by the referees, compared to the whole Boston Celtics team got 17 Free-Throws, Kobe won his 5th Ring. Watch the following video to see yourself: Now I am not saying Kobe is not a legend, I am simply saying that he is given much more credit than some of his more deserving contemporaries. He deserves to be compared to players like John Stocktonand Reggie Miller who are fantastic players, but NOT All-Time Greats like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Tough question because most basketball experts do not overrate him. Most place him somewhere in the top 10–15. That’s about right. But most young basketball fans do overrate him. Many put him in the top 5. Those that do usually do not have strong knowledge of basketball history; usually overrate individual play; and usually overrate athleticism. Players that are definitely ahead of Kobe: Jordan, Magic Johnson, Jabbar, Russell, Chamberlain, Lebron James In my view, none of these are worth debating versus Kobe. Players that are probably ahead of Kobe: Duncan, O’Neal, Bird, Olajuwon, Robertson Players that are close and/or may finish their careers as close: West, Durant, Curry, Moses Malone So, in my view, Kobe is 12th at highest. Or somewhere in the 10–14 range. That’s still great. So what I say next does not diminish him but only puts him in context versus the other great players. Kobe Bryant is definitely the most selfish and least likable teammate of anyone on the list. (Chamberlain is close on the selfish front. Robertson is close on the least likable front). When I engage in these discussions with my fellow GMs, we set up the ground rule as who would I want on my team for 5 years. This is an important distinction because character/personality become increasingly important over time. Indeed, Kobe would likely be in the top ten if this was a single game or single series. Shaq is another guy that loses ground in this area. At his peak, he was crazy dominant but his laziness and selfishness are draining after a period of time. As a contrast, Duncan and Magic are rated higher than their athleticism might indicate because they are the ultimate team guys. But Kobe’s character deflates his teammates, unlike the majority of those ahead of him who elevate their teammates. Over time, team chemistry decreases. And, of course, losses or implosion occur. Is Kobe overrated by young NBA fans, yes. "

Tell me this is a joke. Bruh he's only been in the league one YEAR. Who know who else couldn't stay healthy early in their career? Stephen Curry.   If you actually keep up with the news you'd know Rondo's starting because Luke doesn't want to rush Lonzo back prematurely. He's already said Lonzo's starting PG when's he's fully healthy
"Sure, but that's moving the goalposts a very long way from 'amazing'.  Tyreke Evans and Stephen Curry were rookies that year on teams that won 25 and 26 games, respectively, and they both had very good rookie seasons.  VORP alone estimates that Curry was worth about 6 wins over a replacement player in his rookie year and that Flynn was worth 3 wins **less** than a replacement player -- the 9 wins between them is pretty close to the entire difference in Minnesota and Golden State's records that season."
"It's close, but he fits my top 25, personally.  In no particular order: Kobe, Duncan, Shaq, Mikan, Wilt, LeBron, Moses Malone, Karl Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Michael Jordan, Kareem, Bill Russell, Julius Erving, David Robinson, Kevin Garnett, Oscar Robertson, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, John Stockton, Bob Petit, George Gervin... 24 players I'd comfortably take over Wade. "
"Not a bad day for Stephen Curry either.   Those (leg) clots will probably keep Ernie out of the NBA like they did Chris Bosh (lungs).  Curry finally has an open shot at grabbing that ""GOAT shooter"" title now that [""The Elevator""](http://i.imgur.com/AVq2T0t.jpg) won't be eligible to play in the NBA."
"Yes, there are extremely low volume scorers who thrive usually off offensive rebounds and lobs, but Towns isn't one of them. It's just not possible to create the kinds of shots these players are capable of finishing at a high enough volume to center your offense around them. If you limit by players averaging at least 15 PPG, here are the leaders in true shooting last season %:  |Player| |:-| |Stephen Curry| |Karl-Anthony Towns| |Kevin Durant| |LeBron James| |James Harden| |J.J. Redick| |Kevin Love| |Anthony Davis| |Kyrie Irving| |Julius Randle| |Chris Paul| |Nikola Jokic| |Kyle Lowry| |Giannis Antetokounmpo| |Klay Thompson|  So you have 7 guards, 5 center/forward or forward/centers and 3 forwards. That's pretty balanced and if anything favors perimeter players.  But yeah, if you take out the points filter, you add a bunch of both 3pt specialists and rim runners/offensive rebounders to the list."

Golden.  The miraculous rise of Stephen Curry
"It took me less than a minute on google to find examples of other players talking about the anthem protests  Mike Conley: &gt; “I think the message is getting lost in the kneeling, for a lot of us, with all the narratives that are being brought out of it,” Memphis point guard Mike Conley told USA TODAY Sports. “People (in the public) can kind of say what they want about everybody’s kneeling, but I think I’m more about the action, more about voicing it.  &gt;“I feel like the guys in the NBA have done a really good job, since the players have spoken out on it, of just being vocal. (They’ve been) showing you what their stance is, and what they’re trying to do about it, and hopefully the mindsets and the gears change towards just being productive on that front.”  Stephen Curry: &gt; “Everybody has the liberty of (kneeling), and they should (have that freedom),” Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry told USA TODAY Sports on Sunday in Oakland Calif., where he launched a newly refurbished gym and courts for kids and reiterated that he has no plans to kneel. “I think a lot has been said about how the NBA guys – and definitely the case in the NFL, too – are actually doing stuff on the back end and using their platforms and their connections and their networks and money to actually (make a difference).  &gt;“It feels good to have that kind of impact, to help actually create change in the ways that you can. … The attention needs to be on that, and how that’s impacting the community as opposed to 130 guys kneeling in the NFL. That’s great, but this is the stuff that matters and this is the stuff that can actually move the needle when it comes to impacting the next generation.”  Harrison Barnes: &gt; “I hope that we continue to talk about police brutality, systematic oppression, racism, that we continue to have these conversations,” Dallas Mavericks forward Harrison Barnes told USA TODAY Sports. “When you look at why (Colin) Kaepernick took the knee (last year), it was to bring attention to a topic, to have that conversation. Now whether or not we’ve truly had that conversation, or if it’s been more about the anthem or the protests or now Trump jumping on that bandwagon, it’s still up in the air.   &gt;“But … regardless of whether people take a knee in the NBA or not, more players will continue to use their voice to continue to do projects and continue to give back to communities, continue to help bring reconciliation and healing to this problem that we have. I think that’s the most important thing that can happen.”  This is just from one article.. Most of these guys have been asked about it and have talked about it at some point. To act like LeBron spoke for the entire league and then the rest of them just shut up and fall in line is stupid."
"&gt;	And as far as Kawhi, I can be argued off of this one, but you have to remember that he finished top 3 in MVP voting  I think I’ve heard of this dude who was tbe unanimous MVP, his name was Stephen Curry or something, I think he won another MVP too and three rings, something like that.  "
"Kerr said there were certain things they couldn’t do because of his lack of mobility  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kerr-admits-currys-injuries-forced-few-adjustments-finals  They will never use it as an excuse or show it off (Lebrons cast...) but it did effect them and it was visibly clear to a lot of viewers. Bob Myers also pointed out later that yes he was able to play , but to recover from an injury that keeps you from walking and to come back earlier than usually recommended took a toll on him. It’s not like he sprained an ankle in the game and kept going, he was out of basketball activity then came back too early and played two 7 game series. It’s not that he couldn’t play , it was that he was far from the guy we saw a month earlier before he was hurt. It was a grade 2 MCL sprain that looked a lot worse, usually it’s a 5-7 week recovery before the injury is truly healed. He came back in maybe 2?  Edit: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-stephen-curry-on-the-finals-i-wasnt-100-percent-but-who-cares/  He admits to being hurt , but he won’t ever use that excuse.

"Dario Sarić is and will continue to be a better player to have on your team than Kevin Love because of their gap in playoff production.  Stephen Curry is just as good as Kevin Durant and has been better overall in 3 of the last 4 seasons.  Jimmy Butler is a top 10 player in the NBA right now.  LaMarcus Aldridge is tiers above DeMar DeRozan and will be for the next few years.  The Hornets will clinch a playoff spot with several games left.  Kristaps Porzingis is massively overrated and Julius Randle will be just as good as him overall after this season since Randle will have a large role in a good team... Also the gap between Randle and Porzingis last season was not very large at all, Porzingis just got more opportunities.  Lonzo Ball is already a better player than Rajon Rondo has been after his ACL tear."

"Ok this is ridiculous. Durant joined currys team, i repeat the team led by stephen curry. He lost to curry by blowing a 3-1 lead then hopped on the bandwagon. Durant is good but hes a supplementary scorer, a luxury for the gs team that needs currys skills. Steph is the engine of the warriors and makes the team go. Without him we would be ringless as a team losing to either rockets or cavs. Currys gravity is underrated by casuals who dont understand the impact he has. Coaches carefully gameplan against him by constantly guarding him everywhere on the court. Durant doesnt have that since teams dont care about his points.

"Stephen ""Brandon Belt"" Curry  DFA with extreme prejudice"
"I was legitimately curious about Stephen Curry the moment he was drafted. The entire room cheered when his name was called, even though they wanted him to land in New York. I had this gut feeling that this guy is someone to keep tabs on. His basketball pedigree and skill were undeniable, based on his draft video, all while being skinny for 6'3"". I was still a Laker fan then, but I was already a Stephen Curry fan.  Fast forward to 2013, the year he dropped 54 in MSG with 11 3s, and this cat went supernova on the Nuggets in the playoffs...I was sold on the guy. People called me crazy when I said at the time that I had him winning an MVP in his career, and its safe to say the Chef hasn't disappointed.  I've endured 2016's ending, and the entire year that I had to deal with people saying ""3-1"" to win an argument, and that only solidified my liking of the team. Then KD signed, and people started saying ""that's unfair"" or ""he's a snake"", and since then the Warriors have had this mass dislike for being ""too good"", but they forgot about Steph Curry and his own redemption tour. That man's a killer, and a legitimate basketball player whose dominance is based on skill and not superior athleticism, so as long as he's in the lore of Warriors' history, I'm gonna support this team."
"No.  I meant what triggers me is the piss poor defense from people *defending* Stephen Curry.  Take [this clip](https://streamable.com/14gv7) as an example.  At 25 seconds, Durant is obviously about to set a (moving) screen.  The guy guarding Durant can clearly see what is about to happen.  Everybody watching can clearly see what is about to happen.  What does number 22 do?  Nothing.  He stays at the top of the key and feably gets a hand up when it's too late.  He's about 4-5 feet from Curry and doesn't bother switching.  It's frustrating. "

I think the majority loved the Stephen curry led warriors. I for one certainly did. The hate started coming when KD decided to go there. Hate amplified further when Boogie said fuck it and signed a MLE. You guys deserve the success since you built it the right way. All love for the warriors but fuck KD. 
"There was a whole longform about it a few years ago.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14750602/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-got-best-worst-ankles-sports  &gt; At first, a willowy Curry could deadlift a pitiable 200 to 225 pounds. But then the labor began: less a Rocky training montage, heaving with theatrical workouts, than a time-lapse video, comically dense with, well, time. ""The man was always in the gym,"" teammate Klay Thompson says. ""Steph just stuck with the routine. He works on his body just as much as he works on his jump shot."" By Curry's second year in the program, his dead lifts could touch 400 pounds -- more than twice his bodyweight and second most on the Warriors behind 6-foot-11, 265-pound center Festus Ezeli. ""Steph became more aware of how he needs to take care of his body,"" says his father, Dell Curry, a 16-year NBA vet. ""It helped him understand that his body is his career.""  &gt; The objective is never bulk; Steph prefers his weight at no more than a chiseled 190 pounds. Instead, both Lyles and Payne -- to whom Curry still entrusts his ankles in the summer -- harp on stability amid a storm of jumps, hard cuts and pick-and-rolls. For that same reason, some 90 percent of Curry's lower-body strength work with Payne is one-legged: single-leg reverse lunges, rear-foot elevated single-leg squats, single-leg dead lifts. A standard offseason warm-up involves standing like a flamingo on a squishy blue Airex pad as Payne obscures Curry's vision, sometimes with flashing strobe goggles, and whips basketballs his way. ""Steph's core strength,"" Payne declares, ""is second to none."""

How insecure do those fans have to be to upvote that post. He's Stephen fucking Curry.
"Irving's game is much shiftier than most PGs due to his advanced handles.  But, it's not a mystery how much pressure is put on your knee from something like a spin move.  Just look at some of his contemporaries.  Chris Paul has dealt with knee issues.  Derrick Rose's knee struggles are well known.  There was even a sports science episode dedicated to how much pressure he put on his knees with a spin move.  Stephen Curry is more known for his ankle injuries but he has also dealt with knee issues despite being more of a shooter than a slasher.  John Wall is struggling with knee injuries.  Kobe dealt with knee issues even after he was a more grounded player.  Wade dealt with knee issues.  If you want more perspective, look back further to player like Tim Hardaway that dealt with knee issues.  Iverson dealt with knee issues.  Steve Francis dealt with knee issues.  Arenas dealt with knee issues.  Yea, what I said describes literally every elite guard in the NBA but specifically those who have relied on quick shifting moves like the cross-over or spins.  And, like I already said, even prior to the fractured knee-cap, Irving was struggling with knee pain and tendonitis.  So, apparently, his style of play wasn't exactly gentle on his knees."
"I posted [the link](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12728744/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-became-nba-best-point-guard) just above you but here it is for your convenience. Good article, I remembered loving it at the time."
It's in this article from 2015:  http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12728744/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-became-nba-best-point-guard  but he reworked his shot after he started out hip-shooting it.
"Why use Korver when he is also great off-ball?  He's just older now.  He used to top these all the time.  http://www.nba.com/gmsurvey/2016#misc  *Which player is best at moving without the ball? 1. Klay Thompson, Golden State – 40.0% 2. Kyle Korver, Atlanta – 30.0% 3. J.J. Redick, L.A. Clippers – 16.7% 4. Stephen Curry, Golden State – 6.7% Also receiving votes: Kevin Durant, Golden State; Dwyane Wade, Chicago Last year: Kyle Korver – 69.0%*"
"I mean, I don't think it's exactly that important to include that. As I said, the point of this post is not making a guess at how many threes he'll end the season with. It's a fun statistic that shows how hot he's started. If OP was actually trying to form a legitimate argument that Stephen Curry is gonna finish the season with 538 threes, then yes, he would need to include that. But that isn't what this post is. Besides, a huge portion of people on here are familiar with the record, or at least that it's just a bit over 400 since Curry is the only one to have broken that threshold. "
9 years from now.  Lonzo will the next Stephen Curry.  KIDDING. probably yes probably not. My bet is that he'll be in the G league or a US president.
"Hahahah that’s laughable. Any other human being on this earth you could be like you, and say they will get worse. But we are talking about STEPHEN. WARDELL. CURRY. in fact I feel this will be his best season ever, keep up this production and show the haters he doesn’t need kd "

Drose still top 10 wtf
A little more than Stephen Curry.
"God forsaken Jeremy Lin in favor of the true savior, Wardell Stephen Curry"
&gt; Stephen Curry has his fifth 30-point game of the season with 32 points. Curry and Kevin Durant have both scored 30 points in the same game for the third time this season
And statistically the worst shots. Taking a three is much better in most cases. You'd have to shoot 60% from mid range to match a 40% from three. No one (except Stephen Curry ironically) shoots 60% from mid range
"I don't know about that game, but I think it's just that NBA players are still people. Sometimes defense focus in on them, other times they just have bad games, and sometimes it's multiple things.  [Sophomore Stephen Curry had a 33min game where he was 16.7/0/0 on 12FGA, 4 3PA, and 1FTA.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201112250GSW.html)  It was a nationally televised Christmas game too. Deandre Jordan was 50/NA/60 btw. Rookie Klay was 25/33/100. Monta was still the star of the team so maybe it's that? Warriors also had Kwame Brown.  "
They didn't call him the next Stephen Curry with 40 inch vertical for nothing
"Stephen ""Wally Pipp"" Curry.  "
It was figured out by Tom Haberstroh when he convincingly made the case that [Stephen Curry is the new Michael Jordan](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/nba-insider-tom-haberstroh/stephen-curry-new-michael-jordan)
"I can't find a source, but during the 2016 regular season Curry didn't play in all 73 games the Warriors won and they still won without him.  Some links for proof: https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201512310HOU.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201603010GSW.html  Similarly in the 2016 playoffs, Curry missed a bunch of games against the Blazers, and yet Draymond and Klay carried the Warriors to playoff wins regardless. The Warriors won Game 1 and Game 2 against the Blazers without Curry but with Thompson and Green going off:   https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201605010GSW.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201605030GSW.html  Look at the rebounding, assist, and block numbers from Draymond. Astronomical. They need Draymond to win NOT Curry. Hell, Warriors fans always blame the 2016 finals on losing Green for 1 game. Imagine blaming a finals loss on your 3rd string star. Imagine the Cavs blaming losing because Kevin Love was concussed and missed a game. Imagine the Raptors saying they lost the finals because OG got injured for 1 game. Fucking pathetic. Curry is a pussy and useless without Green.   Don't even get me started on Durant.   In reference to the 2016 playoffs:  &gt;So far in the Warriors' six playoff games — he has missed four games completely and parts of the other two — the Warriors have seen dramatic improvements in how much they are dominating their opponents without Curry, especially beyond the first quarter.  https://www.businessinsider.com/golden-state-warriors-without-stephen-curry-2016-5"
Stephen Curry is good enough to carry to the ECF
What about Stephen Curry? He averages more points than Westbrook
I've heard Stephen Curry is a very good basketball player I will have to check him out sometime. 
I think Stephen Curry tried to make a goofy comment and you could read LeBron‘s face he said get out of my face and He said it to her three times the steph kept at it
I hope everyone on the court not named LeBron James and Stephen Curry step on legos barefoot tonight. Especially the refs. 
Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant have combined for 48 points on 43 shots.   LeBron James has 46 points on 27 shots. 
WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY
"Yes, Lebron James is definitely more known for his half court 3's than Stephen Curry "
“I think you and I are destined to do this forever.” — Stephen Curry/LeBron James
Wardell Stephen Curry ll can shoot the ball well.
&gt;Stephen Curry makes **38-foot** running pullup jump shot (Kevin Durant assists)   Hnnnnnng
"""I gotta testify. Pull up for the shot lookin' extra fly. Fore the day I die, I'mma fuck the sky."" - Stephen Curry"
MVP Tracker through 2 quarters:  1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Love 4. Kevin Durant 5. JR Smith
"Lebron James - 24 points on 88.0 TS%, 2 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 steal.  Stephen Curry - 18 points on 72.3 TS%, 3 rebounds, 6 assists, 1 steal."
"Stephen ""Mr. Fuck Your Sky"" Curry!!!!"
"lol JVG ""stephen curry is such a great rebounding guard"" i'll take things i've never even sort of considered thinking in my life for 1200"
STEPHEN FUCKING CURRY
STEPHEN CURRY!
Seeing that sub is insane to me still. Kevin Durant in for Stephen Curry. 
Finals MVP Tracker through 1:  1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Love 4. JR Smith 5. Jordan Bell
I can name 4 reasons as well  1. Stephen Curry 2. Kevin Durant 3. Klay Thompson  4. Draymond Green   Simple
This is the first nice thing I've ever heard Stephen Curry say about LeBron.
1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Stephen Curry  4. Draymond Green  5. Klay Thompson  6. Kevin Love  7. George Hill  8. Tristian Thompson   9. Kevon Looney   10. JR Smith  
PG: Lebron James SG: Anthony Davis SF: Stephen Curry PF: James Harden C: Kevin Durant  Then i just have Davis play the low block like a center would and have Curry take the ball up like a point guard world
"True, but there was a clear turning point between Games 5 and 6. Their motion offense wasn't working as well, leading to the KD isos, which [changed in game 6](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2018/5/27/17401398/nba-playoffs-2018-warriors-rockets-stephen-curry-figures-out-the-rockets-defense)"
"[Golden State figured out a counter in game 6 though. They started slipping screens which Houston wasn’t prepared for, getting Draymond 4 on 3s or Klay open shots.](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2018/5/27/17401398/nba-playoffs-2018-warriors-rockets-stephen-curry-figures-out-the-rockets-defense)  Houston also sagged off non shooters to double, so they started running the whole “give the ball to him, then run around him”. Jordan Bell did that a lot when he was in  Point is, ISO isn’t the *only* option"
So is Stephen Curry 
"I'm relieved at seeing people unbiasedly quoting Steph because he has been victim of some very terrible headlines resulting from innocent comments recently:  Curry ""Don’t disrespect the other guys out there. They fought hard too.""  - Stephen Curry tired of LeBron James getting all the credit  Curry ""Every time I get subbed out I'm kind of pissed off lol but coach is saving me from myself.""  - Stephen Curry ""pissed off"" every time he gets taken out of the game  Curry ""I loved Jordan, but Bryon Russell was one of my guys and I was hurt that it had to be him. He definitely pushed off, though. (jokingly)""  - Stephen Curry says Jordan ""definitely"" pushed off on legendary shot"
"First of all, what makes ELO the be-all and end-all for team ratings ?  Secondly, according to this LeBron was the underdog against the Mavs in 2011 and against OKC in 2012 ?  People truly must have forgotten that LeBron, Wade and Bosh were first, second and fourth in PER in 2010 before teaming up. Imagine James Harden, Anthony Davis and Stephen Curry teaming up after this season.   And apparently the Cavaliers were the underdog this season in every single series ? Don't you see something wrong with that ?   "
"There's going to be quite a bit of movement on that list:  14\.  Kyle Korver- **236**. He's down 24 to KD, so he won't be moving up.  13\.  KD- **260**. 16 threes back from #10, Paul Pierce.    9\.  JR Smith- **279**. 13 threes away from Kobe/Klay for 6th.    6\.  Klay Thompson- **292**. 28 away from Reggie Miller for 5th.    3\.  Stephen Curry-**356**. Down 8 to LBJ, trails Ray Allen by 29.    2\.  LBJ- **364**. Down 21 to Ray Allen.   If series goes 5, LBJ and Curry stay in their respective places. But it gets interesting after if the series goes 7. "
I am Stephen Curry
Youre a Raptors fan supporting LeBron and you spend time hating on Stephen Curry? Ok bud.

"Don't trip. You just gotta adjust the title to get maximum karma.   ""Stephen Curry in 8th all time in Playoff PPG. Would he be 1st all time without KD..?"""
"1) Kevin Durant is better at guarding LeBron than LeBron is at guarding Durant   2) I love Andre but his lack of presence is being wildly overstated by people. IMHO if there's a healthy Iguodala CP3 and Mbah Moute the whole series it still goes 7 games and game 7 is a coin flip   3) I would take the field over the Warriors to win the 2019 title   4) People look at GSW incorrectly   They think the peak Warriors version is their true self and all those games they ""don't try"" as people label it aren't   The converse is true their peak games are exceptions not the norm they can't control flipping a switch and playing nearly as well as people think. The bad habits are part of who they are and they don't just go away when GSW needs them to    5) KD got scapegoated for their ISO problems last round most of if had to do with GSW having zero off ball movement and just relying on him to do his magic and make it work   6) forget about offense Tristan Thompson will have problems defensively this series he can't move at all like he used to. Durant will cook him again on switches   7) That Houston series was definitely the best defense Klay has ever played and one of the best series I've seen from a guard defensively the past 3-4 years   Outside of that early foul trouble in game 7 he was incredible. Harden repeatedly on drives or ISOs vs him was stuffed. And I've never in a decade of watching CP3 seen anybody neutralize him more than Klay did  8) The Cavs were right to looking at trading Kyrie before his trade demand they needed to improve massively defensively vs GSW to have any shot and he was by far their best trade asset   Good process awful execution  9) This finals will be as bad as 07 Spurs-cavs   10) Stephen curry played better defense last round than Kevin Durant"
Yeah it’s impossible to pull off what the Warriors did because Stephen Curry was underpaid and  the salary cap went up exponentially. The NBA really needs to stop guys from being able to take steep pay cuts. Taking one doesn’t make room for your teammates it just saves money for your employer. 
"The 73-9 Warriors team beats the Cavaliers in 2016, with a godly performance by Stephen Curry winning him FMVP (in actuality, Harrison Barnes simply makes two more corner threes).  Kevin Durant announces his intention to sign with the New York Knicks before Joakim Noah's signing. Durant thrives on the cutting and isolation provided by the Triangle and beats the Cavaliers in the ECF in an epic 7 game duel between him and LeBron James.  The Warriors sweep the Knicks for a successful threepeat.  "
Stephen Curry
"That they lost to Cleveland. They did, but it just didn't make sense. A 73\-9 record team blows a 3\-1 lead? Come on. I think the NBA fell in love with the amount of ratings the ""3\-1"" OKC/GS series got.  [https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2016/05/31/warriors\-thunder\-game\-7\-tv\-ratings\-stephen\-curry/85194370/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2016/05/31/warriors-thunder-game-7-tv-ratings-stephen-curry/85194370/)  Thus the following series had the same thing ***right*** afterwards. What are the odds people? Really? Right afterwards? After the most watched game in the history of the NBA? Come on. \(Not to mention several other sports followed suit with blown leads\) If the Cavs were to lose 4\-1 or 4\-2 like they should have then KD would have never left and went to GS. The greed for ratings and money have created the monster which is now the Golden State Warriors. So the NBA is now paying for it. Now... Give me my downvotes."
"* No one thought Curry would be this good. There was a huge outcry among Warriors fans when Monta was traded in order to develop Curry. [Everyone else thought Curry was only a shooter and was severely undersized.](https://nypost.com/2015/12/05/stephen-curry-had-these-15-perceived-pre-draft-weaknesses/) * [Klay was never projected to be a great 3 and D player.](http://www.nbadraft.net/players/klay-thompson) * [Did we know Draymond would be this good?](http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/draymond-green-2012-nba-draft-second-round-warriors/188ovbppyygz1zmmuhfk5s5yc)  Warriors got good internally, then had the cap space to add an already\-established superstar, which became attracted to the team because of their talent, the growth of that talent, and their system \([installed by a first\-time HC who was a risky hire at the time, especially since they fired MJax, a dude who led them to the playoffs](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/warriors/2014/05/14/steve-kerr-golden-state-head-coach-joe-lacob-mark-jackson/9104855/)\)  Warriors **did** benefit from the cap spike, but they had to git gud first. Durant wouldn't have come to GSW if they were trash, because why would he? Why waste your prime on the fringe of championship contention when you could contend for championships every year, while enjoying the game, your teammates, and your personal living conditions?"
"After a recent Golden State Warriors game, Klay Thompson opened the Chess with Friends app on his phone. He wanted to show a match he was playing against teammate Andre Iguodala to someone he’d never met waiting for him outside the locker room. Thompson thought Magnus Carlsen might be able to offer some assistance.  Magnus Carlsen is the best chess player in the world, according to the official rankings of the sport’s governing body. Klay Thompson introduced himself to Carlsen as the best chess player on the Warriors, according to the official rankings of Klay Thompson.  “Based on loose facts,” he said, “but whatever.”  Thompson plays chess as often as he plays basketball: almost every day. “It’s a great game,” he said. He owns multiple chess boards at home. He carries a magnetic chess set on road trips. And he juggles several chess games on his phone, which is a problem for Thompson: He’s not good at chess on his phone.  “In person, I’m real nice,” he said. “On the phone, I’ll make a couple moves, put my phone down for a couple of days, forget my strategy and think: Why the hell did I do that?”  He added: “You can learn a lot about someone playing chess.”  His childhood friend Seth Tarver, who now works for Thompson’s foundation, knows his chess habits better than anyone and offered this scouting report about Thompson’s game: “One thing about Klay is that he’s at his best when you back him into a corner. He’ll be playing loose, but once I show I’m a threat, he can really lock in.”  Which means Thompson plays basketball the way he plays chess.  The Warriors were down 3-2 in Game 6 of the 2016 conference finals when he scored 41 points to rescue their season. It was a once-in-a-lifetime game. Until it happened again. The Warriors were down 3-2 in Game 6 of the conference final last week when Thompson scored 35 points and sparked another epic comeback. Golden State wouldn’t be in the Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers for the fourth consecutive season without him.  Thompson is their rook. He’s the quietly crucial piece of this potential Warriors dynasty.  He doesn’t seem to mind that he’s an understated All-Star who will never get the glory of Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant. He prefers it that way. Golden State coach Steve Kerr calls Thompson “the most low-maintenance guy on earth.”  Everyone on the Warriors understands his value to their bid for a third championship in four years. His talents fit this team. They don’t need another ballhandler, and he scores the most points in the league off screens. They do need a ball-stopper, and he defends the other team’s best guard. The Warriors are perfect for Thompson, and he is perfect for the Warriors.  But there is nothing about Klay Thompson that screams chess player. This is someone who simply missed practice the day before he erupted for 60 points in 29 minutes. Why? Because he was sleeping. It was more characteristic of Thompson when the Warriors were in New York and he gave one local television station a man-on-the-street interview to discuss his thoughts about…scaffolding. He was identified by his name and occupation: “NBA player.” He might be the spaciest NBA player of his generation.  This is another classic Klay Thompson story. It was the end of the fourth quarter of a tie game in 2012, and the Warriors had the ball and could’ve held it for the last possession. Thompson was completely oblivious to the time, score and situation, though, and he launched a 3-pointer with 16 seconds left. Any chess player would’ve identified it for what it was: a blunder. The shot was inexcusable even before Thompson missed it, and Golden State’s horrified coaches attempted to explain why as he walked back to the bench.  “My bad,” Thompson said. “I’ll make it next time.”  The roots of his fascination with chess were also unexpected. It started in seventh-grade in Portland, Oregon. Riverdale Grade School’s chess teacher, Carl Haessler, a local securities broker who is also a United States Chess Federation Life Master and five-time Oregon state champion, taught his students to be cerebral. “I’m big on the Socratic method,” he said.  He wanted them to know how to think rather than what to think. “How to look down at this thing of all these pieces going every which way,” he said, “and cut out the white noise, look at what’s relevant, assess the position, come to a conclusion, make a plan based upon that conclusion and then make specific moves that fit the plan.”  This is not what Thompson was expecting from chess class.  “I took it as an elective just to waste time,” he said.  The other thing he was not expecting was that he would become obsessed with chess.  “And then I realized, wow, this is actually really fun,” Thompson said. “Just for an hour, to be with your friends, hang out and play chess. It was probably the best class I’ve ever had.”  What he appreciates most about chess are the moments when he can feel the advantage tipping. That sense is familiar to anyone who has watched the Warriors use a sliver of an opening to destroy other teams over the last four years. “I just love how there can be so many swings,” Thompson said, “and it can take one move to mess up the whole flow.”  Thompson is still with his friends, hanging out and playing chess. They abide by the rules of pickup basketball. There is no clock, and the winner of one match getting the advantage of playing white in the next match is their equivalent of make it, take it.  Tarver used to lose so often that he spent time studying why he was losing. “He knows some good tactics,” Tarver said. “I had to learn on the fly. I learned through him beating me.”  He stopped losing soon enough, and he declined to reveal too much about his current strategies against Thompson because they play nearly every day.  “I don’t know who’s better now,” he said. “He’ll probably tell you it’s him.”  Except if they’re playing on their phones. They’re evenly matched in person, when Thompson can devote his full attention to a physical chessboard even as his English bulldog, Rocco, attempts to play with him. But he gets so distracted online that Tarver has to nudge Thompson in person to make a move with his phone.  He’s not the only person who talks chess with Thompson. At one Warriors dinner this season, enough players and coaches were discussing chess that Golden State decided it would be a good idea to invite Carlsen to meet with the team. As it turned out, the reigning world champion is a maniacal NBA fan. He flew to Houston for the conference finals against the Rockets, and the Warriors arranged for Carlsen to have tickets. (Carlsen woke up Tuesday morning and watched Game 7 from Norway.)  Thompson was impressed by Carlsen. “That guy’s smart,” he said. “Understatement that he’s smart. He’s a genius.” And he took advantage of the opportunity to request advice on his openings. “He said he’d sit down and teach me some things one day,” Thompson said.  Thompson, who once compared Ping-Pong games with Roger Federer, thought better of challenging maybe the greatest chess player of all time.  “He’d play blindfolded and backward,” Thompson said, “and still beat me.”"
"Stephen Curry, this is his year."
"&gt; Come on dude. It was a renegotiation and extension. They could have gone all the way up to the cap for his salary this year up to his maximum.  And had to pay him 92.5% of that max every year after.  You cannot pay $30 mil one year and $5 mil a year for 3 years after.  That's not allowed under the CBA.  &gt; Dead money is always important. Especially if you are looking to lock in max guys.   What guys are we not capable of maxing this year because of $2 million in dead money from the trade?  Literally no one - we have the money.  &gt; And the losing the 2nd and getting nothing for it is the bigger deal here anyway.  We got nothing on paper but made our FO look much more respectable.  &gt; Literally no player will give a shit if you kept Jah on the bench. If players come to Philly it's because of Embiid and Simmons.  Dead wrong.  Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant all posed with Okafor’s dad and his “FREE JAH” shirt. Devin Booker, Jayson Tatum, and Isaiah Thomas Tweeted about it.  A lot of players took interest in the Jahlil saga and it will impact their decisions when free agency hits."
"Are you serious?  You're such a fuckin hater man. It's like someone that says they don't like LeBron, they hate on him because he's great, not because he's a bad guy.

You're salty because the warriors and Klay are about to pack you and Cleveland's fudge so you go after the chocolate milk man.   The fucking guy is a walking meme and such a kind person.

This is ripped off the official box score.
"Warriors down 11 Curry contributes to 10 points. I'm arguing your point that ""Durant close the lead by himself"", because he didn't. Again all the plays before they tied. Curry was involved in 4 of 6 for 10 points. In what world is 9 points contributed more than Steph's 10? And it's not like the Rockets didn't score again the moment the warriors made their run. Durant didn't go on a 11-0 run by himself. After the Durant 3, steph took complete control of the game with his scoring instead of just playing making.   10:48 Kevon Looney makes layup (**Stephen Curry** assists) 45 - 56  8:42 Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (**Stephen Curry** assists) 50 - 58  7:48 Nick Young makes 25-foot three point jumper (Kevin Durant assists) 53 - 58  5:54 Draymond Green makes layup (**Stephen Curry** assists) 55 - 59  5:21 **Stephen Curry** makes three point jumper (Jordan Bell assists) 58 - 61  4:29 Kevin Durant makes 25-foot three point jumper (Draymond Green assists) 61 - 61  Did you forget your own claim? Again, quoting you "" Closed Houston’s 10pt lead in the third by himself"" this proves that he didn't. The only play missing in the entire run was a Draymond tip shot off his own miss. "

Depending on how much you value scoring compared to defense+rebounds (both are crazy good at assists), it was a reasonable position to hold, Curry was going supernova every single night.   And it wasn't just fans. In December, [Curry did a Q&amp;A with ESPN:](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14314860/stephen-curry-small-ball-mj-gunning-record-books)  &gt;So you are trying to top MJ as the greatest of all time?  &gt;Yeah.

lmao i thought that said stephen curry for a sec.  i was like damn
"Please...NOBODY knew Curry would be CURRY when the Dubs traded away Monte Ellis.  Remember when everybody was mad as hell that the Warriors actually made that trade?  Well, maybe just Warriors fans.  But  everybody was shitting on Curry saying he was more fragile while Monte was the more athletic player.  My oh my how things have changed.  How's that quote about ""hindsight being 20/20"" go again?  Having said that, as crazy as it sounds who's to say that we don't have our own Curry, Klay, or Draymond on our squad now?  Zo and Ingram are both **20**.  Kuzma is 22 and Randle is 23.  When the Dubs traded away Ellis for Bogut, Curry was older than Zo is now.  Klay and Dray were the same age as Kuza and Randle.   And get this...if we picked up PG13 next season, he would be the around the same age as Iggy when he joined the Warriors!!  I'm not saying that it's a lock all your young guns become all stars like those in the Warriors.  But you gotta at least acknowledge that they show plenty of flashes of it not being outside of the realm of possibility.  Especially if we consider their age and level of development when comparing to the young Warriors.  [https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba\-trade\-winners\-and\-losers\-bogut\-to\-warriors\-ellis\-to\-bucks/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-trade-winners-and-losers-bogut-to-warriors-ellis-to-bucks/)  &gt;LOSERS   &gt;   &gt;**Golden State Warriors**   &gt;   &gt;This is a hugely risky move. Taking on Jackson's contract ties up a lot of money, and they still have a high payroll. It could work out. Stephen Curry\-Jackson\-Dorrell Wright\-David Lee\-Bogut is a pretty good starting five. But Curry and Bogut have injury questions, Jackson is getting older, and that's a lot of money. The Warriors have turned towards the future but still needs a lot to go right for them."
"In the first half, Golden State was having the same sort of calls on hard drives to the paint, and even more so on the glass where Capela and Tucker were allowed to hack and scrum for offensive boards without a single loose ball foul called on either of them.  Besides the point, Houston was getting great looks from outside the three point line and their offensive gameplan was working the exact same as it was in the first half, except in the second half they went 1-30 instead of 6-14 or whatever they shot in the first half.  Golden State endured some bad calls in the first half while they were down, and Houston was unable to endure them in the second half while they were up. This is the NBA, and you have to realize that the officiating will be bad. And there will be swings in every game where the officiating is bad for you and good for you, but it typically evens out. The team that wins, especially in playoff time, is the team that's able to best execute their gameplan and play through the whistles, and Golden State handled that much better tonight.  This can be well attributed to their leadership, whether it be Stephen Curry, Steve Kerr, Kevin Durant, or even a guy like Draymond Green, Golden State has leaders on their team. The Rockets have two leaders in Chris Paul and Mike D'antoni and those guys were both on the bench tonight. If James Harden would've stepped up and calmed his team down or shown some resolve in any way, Houston could've won this game. Easily.  So sick of this lazy, salty, ""rigged"" narrative. I'm done with it. It's wrong."
I guess man. You bring up a ton of valid points I cannot argue with. 2 time MVP Stephen Curry really does not get the calls someone like LeBron James gets. You could replace what you said about the Rockets with the Cavs too. You know Bron is just gonna ISO and ISO and flop around to get the whistles he easily gets.  I have never in my life rooted for James Harden until this series. My hatred for the Warriors have clouded my critical thinking. I just hate that fact with KD. But there's nothing I can do about it and IT WAS LEGAL for him to join them. I have trouble letting it go I guess. I just saw it worse than what CP ever did.
