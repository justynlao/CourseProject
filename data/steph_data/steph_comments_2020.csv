"Stephen Curry is a liability on defense. That certainly stopped the Warriors, didn't it? So was Kyrie. Russ too. Harden. Can keep going..."
Maybe because some guys named Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant were actually healthy most of last season
"Agree. Stephen Curry was really popular for a few years, but even him couldn’t touch the popularity of those 3. Giannis might become more popular in the future. But playing for his current team prevents a lot of people from being able to watch his games."

He's had an amazing 3PT shooting season.      Here's a fun fact for you. These are the best completed seasons in NBA history by 3P% of players who attempted at least 7.5 threes per game.      - Stephen Curry at 45.4% in 2015/16   - Stephen Curry at 45.3% in 12/13   - Stephen Curry at 44.3% in 14/15   - Stephen Curry at 43.7% in 18/19   - Ray Allen at 43.3% in 01/02      Bojan Bogdanovic would come in next if he maintains his 43.0% three point accuracy throughout the season.
"That's bullshit. How is he more fragile? He broke his hand this year due to a freak accident. Other than that, the only thing he's had issues with is his ankles, and he's greatly improved his core strength to alleviate some of the stress on his ankles. Curry can definitely be a proficient volume shooter if he wanted. He's literally running around the entire time he's on the court so it isn't a stamina issue either.  See: https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-currys-intense-core-and-leg-exercises-2016-2"
"This tear is like the one Harden was on last year, but far more efficient and with far less free throws.  &amp;#x200B;  Even Stephen fuckin Curry in 2016 never had a stretch of games THIS meteoric."
"Right now definitely. But I’ll still take healthy Stephen Curry, gap is smaller now though."
Or passing up on Stephen Curry twice.

"The Portland Trail Blazers are pretty fun to watch. They have a once-in-a-generation superstar in Damian Lillard, and his partner in crime CJ McCollum is a straight bucket getter. They also got the grandpa baller in Carmelo Anthony and you will get to witness Dame time and 35 feet+ 3s on the daily.  The Los Angeles Clippers, arguably the best team in the league by far. Also makes a good storyline with the LA rivalry with the Lakers now. If they knock down LA in the WCF and win the NBA championship this year, there will be a new sheriff in town and his name is Kawhi Leonard.  The Phoenix Suns. This is a team that no one is talking about or even paying attention to right now. They are stacked with young talents and is bring led by a young superstar in Devin Booker and the under-appreciated star player in Kelly Oubre. They play hard night in and night out and nobody expects them to win or even make the playoffs. They will be fun to watch in the next few years.  The Minnesota Timberwolves, if they get D’angelo Russell to team up with Karl-Anthony Towns. There will be a new super team in the West.  The Brooklyn Nets. They will take over the city and become the new mecca of NY. They are likely to reach the ECF with a healthy Kevin Durant and a magician in Kyrie Irving.  The Golden State Warriors. No need to say more - Stephen Curry."

With that said, Dame’s been on an absolute tear lately and is having an awesome season in his own right. Portland has needed every ounce of it, too. Kind of hope he gets MVP consideration.

God awful season is clearly due to injuries and is not his fault"

Lamelo's handles are good but not elite. Elite describes a player like Kyrie or younger Stephen Curry
Show some respect man. Had it easy? You’re acting like he’s Stephen Curry with an nba father or something. LeBron didn’t have shit easy
"Of course. But you can shore up those weaknesses so they are less exploitable. For you to deny that being possible is to not acknowledge reality.   Russell Westbrook has been a solid open three point shooter in his career, already. I have no clue why you continue to pretend as if that is something out of the realm of possibility for Westbrook to rediscover once again.   You are a Warriors fan.  Stephen Curry is still a limited defender.  But he has worked to become far less of a liability than earlier in his career. It's still a weakness relative to peers, but he's no longer inept in that skill.  Would you rather Stephen Curry never work on his defense and continue to be a massive liability who cannot stop a nosebleed or was it important for him to dedicate an offseason with the training staff in improving his weakest area.   Ben Simmons is 23 years old. I have no idea why you're eulogizing his potential as a shooter at 23 years old. He spent much of the offseason trying to work on shooting threes. His head coach is pressuring him to shoot threes. His own fanbase is pressuring him to shoot threes. Are you going to call his trainer and organization wrong for pushing him in that direction? Are you calling them stupid for pushing them in that direction from your armchair? Or are they doing so because they understand the importance of improving in the three and understand that he CAN make strides in that shot without enough work.  &gt;You're still acting as though you can force it to happen.  Nobody said that at all. You aren't reading my posts and you aren't arguing in good faith either."
"Yeah that makes sense, it's definitely a 'prove it' league. It's still a bit frustrating when you debate players with a sub of people who can't believe something is possible unless they've witnessed it personally. When glancing at the standings can always take precedent over individual talent eval it just makes for shitty conversation. Hypotheticals are fun, like 'which of his peers could you swap him for and expect better results?' but those can get shut down easily when most of his peers play for better teams anyway and some one can always drop the W/L conversation-stopper. One of the worst parts of Stephen Curry getting injured was that nobody would get the chance to see one of the GOAT players lead his team to the lottery, and the rationalizations that come from that.   But I get it, until the core can prove they can make the playoffs there's always going to be questions about the players, most of them fair."

Stephen Curry is the highest impact player in the league.
I don’t agree with that. Just like how you can’t say KD is better than Giannis right now considering KD won’t play this season. How do we know he’s still better? Just like how this season and this season only Stephen Curry is not the best PG in the league.
"Hold up I’m only talking this season...if we’re talking all time then those miles get bigger my friend considering Kyrie never scraped at All NBA first team and never even reached for MVP. We really should avoid making this a career conversation because it gets worse for him. Kyrie isn’t better than Westbrook at anything this season besides shooting 3’s. Westbrook and Kyrie are averaging the same PPG (26.1 vs 25.8 aka both round to 26) while Westbrook is playing sidekick to Harden. Westbrook gets to the basket better, better defender, better playmaker. The only thing Kyrie has on him is shooting 3’s and another point you made yourself is that Kyrie is missing games and when you don’t play half the season you can’t really be in the conversation of the best just like how Stephen Curry isn’t in the best PG convo this season neither is Klay in the convo for best SG."
"KD went down, the Rockets almost push the semis to 7 games had it not been for Stephen Curry 30 point 2nd half"
Why do Warriors fans say this?  Jacob Evans is a very good 3 and D guy.  Look up his catch and shoot 3's.  It is very very respectable.  He is being asked to do things that he is not suited for and that is why his overall numbers are not looking good.  Wait until Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are back.  He will not be asked to create and drive into clogged lanes.  He will slide to the open corners and nail 3s at a high clip.

"&gt; A new year, at the start of a new decade, makes this a natural time for N.B.A. teams to search for innovative ways to combat the offensive flourish of the previous decade.  &gt; Yet as disconsonant as it sounds, especially for a league reputed to be as progressive as the N.B.A., its coaches are increasingly dipping into the past for a defensive alignment that tends to be branded as antiquated or, worse, collegiate.  &gt; “There’s definitely more use of zone this season,” said Dallas Mavericks Coach Rick Carlisle. “Offenses are getting so good that if you can come up with some kind of defense that can upset rhythm a little bit, it’s viewed as a positive thing.”  &gt; Overall usage of zone defenses — schemes that call for defenders to guard a specific area of space rather than an opposing player — is up 50 percent from last season, according to Synergy Sports data. The increase per possession is 10.8 percent, according to data provided to N.B.A. teams by Second Spectrum.  &gt; A leaguewide average of 2.3 zone possessions per game remains modest, but the rise Carlisle referenced is more tangibly reflected by the number of teams regarded as regular zone practitioners.  &gt; Dallas, Toronto, Washington, Charlotte and the Los Angeles Clippers have joined Miami and the Nets as teams known to utilize zone schemes 4 to 10 percent of the time, according to Synergy. The Heat and Nets were outliers last season, employing zone schemes on 10.9 percent and 8.4 percent of their defensive possessions, according to Second Spectrum.  &gt; The stigma against zone schemes is strong, because turning to a zone alignment has long been regarded in the N.B.A. as a sign of weakness — gimmickry to cover up for poor individual defenders. Clippers Coach Doc Rivers recently suggested that Glenn Whittenberg, his former high school coach at Proviso East in Maywood, Ill., was likely “rolling over in his grave right now” in response to the amount of zone Rivers is using.  &gt; “He thought zone was a weak man’s game,” Rivers said.  &gt; The Hall of Fame guard Gary Payton still does. Payton retired in 2007, but the smothering guard unforgettably known as “The Glove” remains a passionate critic of zones at the pro level — even though his son Gary Payton II of the Washington Wizards happens to play for the N.B.A. team using more zone than anyone (9.8 percent of the time, per Synergy).  &gt; “Trash,” Gary Payton said in a phone interview. “That’s a cop-out. Why do college teams go to a zone? Because they can’t guard anybody.”  &gt; The Wizards’ No. 30 defensive rating through Thursday (Washington was allowing 115.4 points per 100 possessions) appears to support Payton’s contention. Yet in Toronto, Coach Nick Nurse has a roster filled with elite defenders, which has encouraged Nurse to not only embrace zones but also experiment with a variety of defenses rarely seen at the pro level.  &gt; In one memorable Game 2 sequence of the 2019 N.B.A. finals, Nurse unleashed “box-and-one” coverage on Golden State’s Stephen Curry — four players in a square-shaped zone, with Fred VanVleet shadowing Curry as closely as possible.  &gt; As the league’s defending champion, Toronto has countered injuries to key figures such as Pascal Siakam, Marc Gasol and Kyle Lowry this season with half-court double-teaming of Houston’s James Harden, 1-2-1-1 zone pressing and more box-and-one that, according to conventional N.B.A. wisdom, should not work against most skilled offensive players on the planet.  &gt; The Raptors have also mixed in a good bit of 2-3 zone — two defenders at the top with a row of three behind them — in securing the No. 2 spot in defensive rating despite all of their health woes.  &gt; “I think we have seen that some of these other defenses have worked,” said Nurse, whose Raptors are on a surprising 53-win pace even after losing the finals M.V.P. Kawhi Leonard in free agency. “For parts of games, anyway.”  &gt; After Leonard’s arrival — along with the acquisition of Paul George to join the tenacious Patrick Beverley and mobile frontcourt players such as Montrezl Harrell, Maurice Harkless and JaMychal Green — Rivers decided that the Clippers’ roster composition compelled him to think more openly about zones.  &gt; “We have a switchable basketball team for the first time in my career,” Rivers said, referring to the ability of similarly sized players to easily switch onto a different offensive player in the midst of a possession.  &gt; The Clippers, as a result, have used zone looks on 4 percent of their defensive possessions, according to Second Spectrum, and, like Carlisle’s Mavericks, have held the opposition to less than a point per possession when in a zone setup.  &gt; Beverley has said that, despite his own Payton-like determination to harass other guards, he has no issues when Rivers calls for zones. He played for nearly four seasons in Europe before establishing himself in the N.B.A., and zone defense is much more prevalent in leagues overseas.  &gt; Rivers, though, admits he will sometimes refer to it as a “flex zone” — or “more of a switching defense than a zone” — to encourage player acceptance.  &gt; The potential payoff of a well-executed zone is clear, despite the vulnerabilities it exposes in terms of rebounding and surrendering open shots. A good zone, at least for a time, can create confusion, inspire hesitation and potentially dislodge offensive supernovas such as Harden and Curry from their comfort zones.  &gt; Thanks to a lack of dependable perimeter shooters around the All-Star big man Joel Embiid, no team faces more zones than the Philadelphia 76ers. The most notable culprit for inviting that strategy is Ben Simmons, Embiid’s fellow All-Star, who has attempted only five 3-pointers all season — sinking two after shooting 0-for-17 from deep over his first two N.B.A. seasons.  &gt; The Athletic reported in December that the Sixers saw a zone on 156 possessions in a three-game stretch against Miami, Dallas and Washington over a four-day span. According to Synergy Sports data used in the report, 21 of the league’s 30 teams faced fewer than 156 possessions of zone defense for the entire 2018-19 season.  &gt; “We’ve seen so much innovation and change offensively over the last five years,” Toronto’s Nurse said. “It only makes sense that teams are going to try things and look for things defensively to counter that.”  &gt; The limited practice time teams enjoy in the modern game makes it challenging for coaches to implement zone coverages, because they typically require additional preparation and increased communication among the defenders. But that didn’t stop the Los Angeles Lakers, No. 3 in the league in defensive rating, from springing a surprise on Carlisle’s Mavericks on Jan. 10.  &gt; In a move right out of the Mavericks’ playbook, with the former Dallas guard Jason Kidd now on the bench as an assistant to Lakers Coach Frank Vogel, Los Angeles used a zone for numerous possessions in the second quarter in an attempt to short-circuit the rising Dallas star Luka Doncic’s usual pick-and-roll effectiveness — and then fell back into man-to-man coverage as soon as the Mavericks made their first pass. It’s a ploy Dallas used frequently against LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the 2011 N.B.A. finals, in which the Mavericks upset Miami in six games.  &gt; But James was on the winning side this time, with the Lakers rolling up a 21-point lead in the first half in an eventual 129-114 road win despite the absence of an ailing Anthony Davis.  &gt; The Mavericks, to this day, believe they would not have won their lone championship without substantial doses of zone. For all the talk that N.B.A. shooters are simply too proficient for teams to stay in zones for long, Carlisle expects zone defense to continue its comeback in the second half of the season.  &gt; “It’s been very cyclical in the last eight or nine years,” Carlisle said. “But the teams that are using it are using it with effectiveness. And you have to prepare for it. If you’re not prepared for it, you’re going to be up against it.”"
People are idiots. Stephen Curry and the Warriors probably the best thing to happen to the NBA past 20 years

Yeah, three pointers might be the MOST effecient, but dont ignore the importance of the midrange.

"LeBron never faces a true double team, where the other team sells out and commits 2 defenders to him entirely. No NBA player does unless they're at the rim because it would leave his teammates with a 4 on 3 advantage and they would light the opponent up. However if implemented, LeBron wouldn't even be able to score and for reference, this exact strategy was used on Steph Curry by a team his final year at Davidson and he scored 0 points on 0-3 shooting. This same Stephen Curry walked into the NBA 10 months later and averaged 18/5/8 on 47/44/89 splits. Now his team still won by 30 as they were playing a vastly inferior opponent and his teammates were still legitimately good(they finished above .500 the very next season with Curry no longer on the roster), but the point remains if a team wants to stop someone, it can easily be done by compromising the rest of your defense. However in this scenario, LeBron's teammates wouldn't be able to take advantage of playing 3 on 4 because they're legitimately outclassed by the opposing 3  still would be at a disadvantage. There was probably a larger gap between the 2 players double teaming Curry and what will be for 2 future lottery picks likely guarding LeBron.   This is what the worst college basketball team looks like playing against a mediocre Utah team that is 10-7 and has lost 5 of their last 6 games.   ||Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi|Basi| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Starters|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PTS| |Miss St Va|21|80|.263|3|40|.133|3|6|.500|7|19|26|10|9|6|17|49| |Utah|57|90|.633|17|34|.500|12|13|.923|10|51|61|41|6|3|11|143|"

He’s talking about Stephen Curry.
"Yeah, a minimum player. Maybe I'm being unclear, this is the salary cap math **IF** Giannis wants to come:  Hard cap: 157M  Projected minimum roster charge: 1.03M  Trade:  1) Warriors trade DLo + 2020 FRP for Giannis in a sign and trade  2) Warriors trade Looney + Evans + Spellman  + 2021 FRP to a random team for zero money back  Cap sheet now looks like this:   - Stephen Curry: 45.78M - Klay Thompson: 37.98M - Giannis Antetokounmpo: 37.5M - Draymond Green: 24.02M - Eric Paschall: 1.78M - Jordan Poole: 2.16M - Incomplete Roster Charge 1  - Incomplete Roster Charge 2 - Incomplete Roster Charge 3 - Incomplete Roster Charge 4 - Incomplete Roster Charge 5 - Incomplete Roster Charge 6 - Incomplete Roster Charge 7  Dead Cap  - Shaun Livingston: 666k  Total: 157.1M  So right there the Warriors can get within 100k of the hard cap with 2 simple moves, getting rid of Jordan Poole brings them under with a 1M cushion."
Yeah go ahead and make the argument that Stephen Curry would turn into a role player while Mark Price existed and had no issues with handchecking while being less skilled as a shooter than Curry.   Pretend as though every single star guard from back in the day was better equipped to deal with handchecking than Stephen Curry. Zero guys he could replace and do an even better job than they did because he's better at basketball.

"One justifiable list of many possible ones (starting in 2011 since that Rose MVP was the most obvious ""we'll never give it to the same guy three years in a row again"" in a while.  If Giannis wins this year, no way in hell he wins in 2021 unless he puts up like 40/12 on 60% shooting).  2011	LeBron James   2012	LeBron James   2013	LeBron James   2014	Kevin Durant   2015	LeBron James   2016	Stephen Curry   2017	LeBron James   2018	LeBron James"
Stephen Curry exists
[1st example that comes to mind](https://theleadsportsmedia.com/behind-back-turnover-stephen-curry-finals-still-haunts/)
without Draymond Green (tank management) or Stephen Curry (tank management)
"Here's the list of players who expose Gobert in PnR.  Stephen Curry James Harden Russell Westbrook Giannis Chris Paul  End of list.  4 MVP's and a Hall of Famer.  Guys who beat everyone, but that's suddenly equal to ""Gobert can't defend the P&amp;R"""
"Why is that disturbing? Whether we like it or not, stephen curry means a lot more to a lot of people than some rando in the hospital. Whether we think that's right or not, that's just what it is. Given his job, it's really important to know whether he's got the thing."
Harden in the past 4 years has had 3 despicable playoff defeats:   - losing 4-1 to the Warriors without Stephen Curry (only played 30 minutes in the series) was despicable.   - losing game 6 at home as the series favorite by 41 without kawhi was despicable.   - losing game 5 and game 6 after kd was injured and the game was tied was despicable.   - I don't blame him for game 6 and game 7 with cp3 though. Losing a top 5-7 player in a series is too hard to overcome.
Stephen Curry when he joins the Warriors
To add: 2015 Game 5 in the Finals between LeBron James and Stephen Curry was awesome... LeBron had a 40 point triple double meanwhile Steph had 37/7/4 including 17 in the 4th quarter with some of his best highlight shots ever happening in that quarter.
"Better than the version of KD who played for SuperSonics.   I would say KD is better but it’s not as far as you’re making it seem.  Look at the first nine years of their career, before KD joined GSW. Barkley averaged more rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per 100 than KD. Barkley was also more efficient. KD only has points on him, but Barkley was doing it on higher TS%. [Barkley has the most efficient 20+ppg seasons by players not named Stephen Curry](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=41&amp;c2stat=pts_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=20&amp;order_by=ts_pct)  And KD wouldn’t have any rings or FMVPs if he didn’t bandwagon over to the 73-9 Warriors"

"Stephen Curry was born in Akron but never really lived there. It's just the cities they were born in, not hometowns."
"&gt;There's a slight variation in our numbers because you're including shots from farther than 40+  Yes, you are correct; I didn't catch that you were (arbitrarily) excluding this set.  &gt;I didn't include those because 1) they aren't jumpshots   lol. not touching that take with a 10ft pole.  &gt;Dame has made 43 shots from 30-40 feet this season in 55 games.  &gt;43/55 x 82 = 64.1  That's an incorrect extrapolation for his pace. The Pacers have played 63 games, not 55. Whether or not he was injured doesn't matter, since players almost always miss games (ESPECIALLY when you're comparing him to Wardell Stephen ""Glass Ankles"" Curry).  (82/62)*43 = 56.  Therefore, when correcting for your actual proposition and improper data extrapolation, Dame is on pace for 56, and 56&lt;61.  &gt;There's another 19 games, so you would expect 15 more makes. That puts him at 58 for the year. Idk about you, but 58 and 61 are close enough for me to say Dame's on pace to make as many as Steph ever has  This is more mathematically sound, even if you're making the (not guaranteed) assumption that the injury won't affect him again. Even still, 58 &lt; 61, so your original assertion does not hold up.  Now, is 58 in a year impressive? Incredibly! And yes, it's very close to the 61. However, you didn't say close, you said more... and as nerd I need to hold you to that :). lol."

THE BRILLIANT SHOOTING OF STEPHEN CURRY CONTINUES
I love Kipling Collegiate Institute alumni Stephen Curry and I’m not afraid to admit I’ve missed him 🥺
WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY II
Stephen Curry would fit great with this team
"it's funny because i don't even mythologize him. in fact, most people call me an MJ hater on here because i dont think he's the GOAT. but i do recognize the obvious fact that he is the greatest scorer in league history and him being put on an island with stephen curry is an incredible mismatch"
"The clue is ""Stephen Curry in 2016 won the trademark for this nickname of his that describes how ridiculous his long-range shot is.""  Give me the Jeopardy question."
"i dont even know how to respond to this because the idea that a team would let MICHAEL JORDAN ""get his"" in a 1 on 1 matchup with STEPHEN CURRY is so bizarre.   yeah at that point i wouldnt want MJ to be doing any sharing considering how insanely efficient the offense would be without him passing the ball at all."
"I don't think they're playing all that much worse than they have been on the season (which, as team, is pretty bad - but not every player on the team is) but when compared with *Stephen Curry* there's not many players that have an easy time looking good playing alongside him."
"Steph ""Stephen Curry"" Curry  Missed this shit"
The Warriors are loaded.  From Stephen Curry to the X-Files Guy!
Tbf he's really good but he's not Stephen Curry/Kevin Durant/LeBron James/Kobe Bryant/Michael Jordan-great.
Welcome back Sir Stephen Wardell Curry
Norman Powell: 16 points  Stephen Curry: 3 points
"Sorry, need me to use smaller words and slow down buddy?  Stephen Curry shoot good.  On hard shots too.  Curry good at shooting.  Very very good.  People say Curry best shooter all time.

"Davidson offered him a full scholarship, but Seth didn’t want to be in his brother’s shadow. Stephen had not yet declared for the NBA draft by the time Seth signed with Liberty.  The Curry family is deeply religious, which probably played a big part in Seth choosing Liberty."
"Their two best players, Stephen Curry (left hand, mid season) and Klay Thompson (partial ACL tear in the playoffs) we’re out with injury, KD signed with the Nets, and they pretty much just have role players who kinda good at certain things but don’t have enough talent together to win games. I mean Draymond Green was their best player and even he’s just a basic role player too. Very good at his role, but he’s not a superstar or anything. He can’t really score on his own and that’s really where the issues lie. Nobody can make their own shot  Also, since their best players are injured, they tanked on purpose this season so they could get a really high draft pick in the lottery"

"Unless we’re talking Girl Scout cookies, Al Pacino movies or Stevie Wonder albums, everything has a saturation limit, or at least it should.  Is scoring in the NBA reaching that point?  For a league that was desperate to see scoring reach the 100s when games were slow marches to 90, the rules were opened up to increase scoring, limit overly physical play and display the athletes at their best.  That has had the desired effect — almost too well.  Every team is averaging well over 100 points per game (league average 111.4), with the Charlotte Hornets bringing up the rear at a measly 102 per night — the same production as the Miami Heat back in 2010-11.  Yes, that’s the first year of the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh partnership.  The game we’re watching nightly is so drastically different from the contests we saw even five years ago.  Remember that Stephen Curry bomb on Feb. 27, 2016, against the Oklahoma City Thunder in one of the greatest regular-season games of the decade? The 40-ish footer from barely a step inside of half-court that caught everyone off-guard, especially Anthony Roberson?  Well, LeBron James has hit shots from that zip code twice in the last week. The first was the “not yet, kid” triple Sunday that quieted the frenzied New Orleans crowd after Zion Williamson brought the house down with a dynamite dunk on a nationally televised game.  The second was a calm, walk-up triple Tuesday from the Los Angeles Lakers logo a couple nights ago.  The skill levels of the incumbent players as well as the young stars entering the league have been aided by the rules being so loose.  According to basketball-reference.com creator Justin Kubatko, February was the second month in league history in which six players — Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum and Damian Lillard — averaged 30 points or more.  The first month that occurred?  January 2020, with Kawhi Leonard and Devin Booker joining Lillard, Westbrook, Young and Beal.  Notice the names that haven’t been mentioned? Luminaries like James, Curry, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Curry has been out most of the year, but he could wind up on that list next year, and with Durant recovering from an Achilles injury, he could return to elite status next season.  For all we know, we could be in the most golden of golden eras of scoring, with talent like Zion Williamson and Luka Doncic ready to do more damage as time goes on.  But if these explosions are so commonplace, does it diminish how special it feels, especially with defenses not having much of a chance to earn the benefit of the doubt?  Whether it’s the “gather and two steps” rule or no more hand-checking or mere evolution, it feels like we’re in a juiced-ball era that would make the slow-down coaches of the ’90s cringe.  This isn’t opining to go back there, not by a long shot.  But maybe, just maybe, we can play some games on All-Madden once in a while?  OK, old man no longer yelling at cloud.  [Vincent Goodwill](https://sports.yahoo.com/is-there-too-much-scoring-in-the-nba-203352903.html)"
&gt;both sides   No it didn’t that’s so wrong. I love Stephen Curry as much as anyone but he’s not a great defender and Klay consistently had to cover for him.   On offense I can agree but also it led him to taking less shots than other players of his quality.
Oh no...should we tell Curry? STEPHEN A IS WORRIED. Lmao what a joke.
It doesnt work like that lol benefit?? Really??  Heres a test for you. Go shoot hoops every day all day for years until youre like the stephen curry of your gym.    Play full court 5 vs 5 games for awhile several times a week and consistently competting with the best guys that play there. Do this for awhile like years... Then i want you to stop playing for 3 years. Practice for a few months then play again at the top competitively with the same top guys. See what kind of “great” stats u put up from that 3 years off.  Whos going to put up better stats? You who didnt do shit for 3 years vs you if you had played the whole time??  Jordan putting up 24 ppg(29 ppg in his last 10 games before injury including a back to back 40 point games) after 3 years away at age 38-39 is crazy
You’re hilariously wrong on all accounts minus the advanced stat point  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Brandon+Ingram&amp;player_id1_select=Brandon+Ingram&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id1=ingrabr01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id2_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y2=2013&amp;player_id2=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id3_select=James+Harden&amp;y3=2013&amp;player_id3=hardeja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id4_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y4=2012&amp;player_id4=westbru01&amp;idx=players  Go look at those numbers and tell me they aren’t overwhelmingly similar

Who need Stephen Curry when we have Jordan Poole
" Harden's last 5 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) have ended by him losing breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard, and losing to a warriors team without kd and giving up 33 second half points to Stephen Curry who was scoreless in the first half of an elimination game in Toyota Center. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019: Harden shoot 11-25 from the field, 58.3% from free throws ([3rd worst game of this season by FT%](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bn7vhu/hardens_712_from_the_ft_line_is_in_line_with_the/)) and caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."

"I applaud the Warriors taking a flier on a guy, but this Stephen Curry is the kind of combo guard that never pans out."
"Lillard could possibly do it if he has a good team around him. He has had 50% FG years and 90% FT years before. This year he was shooting 39.3% from three. If he had the luxury of playing with more offensive talent he could’ve been more selective.   A 50-40-90 is slightly more common than you mentioned but it’s still very uncommon...   All NBA players with at least one 50-40-90 season:  Larry Bird with the Boston Celtics, Malcolm Brogdon with the Milwaukee Bucks, Stephen Curry with the Golden State Warriors, Kevin Durant with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Reggie Miller with the Indiana Pacers, Steve Nash with the Phoenix Suns, Dirk Nowitzki with the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Price with the Cleveland Cavaliers  WNBA:  Elena Delle Donne with the Washington Mystics"
0% chance Stephen Curry plays in a G-League game.
"Klay Thompson, Devin Booker, Karl Anthony Towns, Stephen Curry, and the most likely candidates in my opinion James Harden, and Trae Young.  High volume Scorers who heat up early and often, and receive foul calls to push things even further."
"It's Wardell Stephen Curry II, not III. While his grandad was named Wardell Curry, he wasn't named Wardell *Stephen* Curry."

"I mean... ""the media"" isn't just Bill Simmons, Zach Lowe, Stephen A. and the other guys that reddit claims to be tired of but every quote of theirs is posted here.   And, a role player on the 7 seed, sure. But, how about a guy who bounced around the Warriors, Grizzlies, Cavs, Magic, Suns before finding a permanent home in the NBA, is now starting scoring 20 points per game in the last month, and in that time moved up to 2nd all time in 3 point percentage in history? That's worth a story, tweet, highlight reel of made 3's, or whatever. I'm not mad, I was really just saying that since Seth Curry has been starting he's averaged 20 points per game on 56% from 3, which is pretty unheard of.  And man, you don't have to get so angry. When Robert Covington joined your team and racked up like 20 blocks in 6 games, I bet you wanted ESPN or B/R or the Athletic or The Ringer to acknowledge his great play.  Edit: You took out your ""why the fuck"" you ain't slick, lmao."

I mean it's nice but the volume is so minimal.      In February of 2016 Stephen Curry shot 53.6% from three on 12.5 attempts per game from deep.
I'm surprised that Stephen Curry isn't in the top 5. I thought he'd for sure have a monster month like this one back in his 2015-16 season.

"""Stephen Curry has faced a setback with his hand injury"""
The fact that Stephen Curry is in the top 5 is fucking unbelievable.

I thought Stephen Curry was injured and played for the Warriors
I think Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson talked about him on the all the smoke podcast with Steph Curry. I just watched that episode last week
"What if I told you, that the Golden State Warriors would be led to the promise Land with Stephen Curry. Then it took a 73-9 season with the greatest performance from LeBron James, a player better than Jordan potentially, and a string of bad luck to defeat them. However I'm not done yet, Kevin Durant, a Wilt Chamberlain with a 3 and skinny frame at SF to join us and defeat LeBron James back to back. I still can't imagine it"
"I don't think you understand. Jokic is 5,000 times more a point guard than a power forward by definition. You mean to say Jokic is redefining the C position. [Look at his size](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/nikola-jokic-kemba-walker-dangelo-russell-stephen-curry-blake-griffin-picture-id1125512336?s=2048x2048) for yourself"
"I'd like to think that one aspect of what he's saying gets captured in (for instance): https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/  Scroll down a bit to the charts titled ""How key players affect their teammates"" and then this bit below that chart, which I find amazing:  ""There are stories to be told in each section of that chart, but for our purposes, focus on the fire raining down from the sky in the Curry section. Not only do virtually all of his teammates (10 of 11 players with at least 30 shots, representing over 1,700 shots taken without him) shoot worse without Curry on the court to draw attention, they shoot dramatically worse. Overall, Curry’s teammates shoot 7.3 percentage points worse with Curry off the court, with his average teammate shooting 8.3 points worse. Among our MVP candidates, LeBron has the next-highest impact on average teammate shooting (3.9 points), followed by Westbrook (2.5 points). When it comes to opening up a team’s offense, Curry has no equal."""
"Chauncey Billups, Stephen Curry, Magic Johnson."

"In a series against Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant Lebron hid on Draymond Green, forcing 38 year old Richard Jefferson to try and guard KD. Lebron had a few good years as a defender in Miami and the end of his first cavs stint, but outside of that he has been pretty average."
aww the stephen curry flair is sad
What’s short Steven harden? Stephen curry???
I'm calling it Trae young is the next Stephen Curry with defense
“They do have a timeout.. decide not to use it. CURRY WAY DOWNTOWN.. BANG! BANG! OH WHAT A SHOT FROM CURRY! WITH SIX TENTHS OF A SECOND REMAINING!”  “The brilliant shooting of Stephen Curry continues!”
“Today a tragedy befell my personal hero Stephen Curry...”
That Warriors team was the most intimidating team ever though. Having Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry on the same team should have never been allowed.
"   As Snyder remembers it, the Jazz’s first meeting to discuss the coronavirus and COVID-19 was on a Feb. 25 practice day at home. The NBA’s first memo instructing teams to discuss the dangers of the disease didn’t come until March 1. The Jazz’s precautions, and the meetings, would only grow more comprehensive from there.  “Coach was coming in weeks before any of this spike had even become that big a topic, and was talking to us about it,” forward Joe Ingles said. “So we actually felt like we were steps ahead of any other team, or businesses or anything.”  The lessons were so thorough, and so constant, that there were even people around the Jazz who believed Snyder and his staff were possibly doing too much. But an overreaction, as the world has learned since, is better than an underreaction when dealing with this sort of medical crisis.  “The more communication we had on it, you felt like it’s just a matter of time (before it hits the NBA),” Snyder explained. “I wanted our guys to be educated on it regardless of how extreme it became, so we started out (talking). You try to … (have) all of us try to keep perspective. We were discussing it, and everybody was trying to raise awareness initially and just conversationally and in meetings.”  At first, it was Snyder alone sharing his perspective on the frightening matter. He tried to raise their collective awareness, to get them to look outside the basketball bubble and pay closer attention to the threat that was coming everyone’s way. He would even work it into a postgame speech, just as he did after Utah’s 111-105 win over Detroit on March 7.  Snyder sought the help of the experts, too. During the Jazz’s four-game road trip that ended that night against the Pistons, he asked Jazz trainer Eric Waters to put together a more formal meeting on the matter and to contribute with his voice.  There was a PowerPoint presentation and COVID-19 pamphlets for the players to keep. There was Purell hand sanitizer for everyone in each of the visitors’ locker rooms in a four-game trip through Cleveland, New York, Boston and Detroit. There were wipes to sanitize everyone’s phones, and a strong suggestion that they stop signing autographs for fans. By this point, Elliott had joined Snyder’s unofficial support group.  The players, Ingles acknowledges, were still taking it somewhat lightly.  “I think the first meeting or two, everyone was kind of sitting in there like — not *not* caring about it, but it was a bit more like, ‘All right, let’s be careful but let’s still live our lives’ and whatever,” he said during a [recent visit on *The Athletic*’s “Tampering” podcast.](https://theathletic.com/podcast/20-tampering/?episode=49)  Yet as the Jazz headed home from the four-game trip, Snyder &amp; Co. decided to take an even deeper dive into this discussion and, they hoped, change the attitudes of *all* of their players — including Gobert. They scheduled a March 9 meeting in Salt Lake City that would include Dave Petron, a University of Utah doctor who has been the Jazz’s chief medical officer since 2014, as well as other officials from the nearby college. With Toronto in town for that Monday night’s game, they spent more than an hour on the topic after the morning shoot-around.  “The idea was just to kind of keep putting layers on (the message),” Snyder said of the meeting. “At the time, too, what was going on in Seattle began to increase and accelerate. I remember Matt (Snyder) was trying to figure out how to operate his store, and you’re kind of seeing it coming.  “And then, when we had one of the last meetings, they were talking about it and what I remember is (them saying) it’s a moving target, you know? And everything we’re doing now, we’re going to know more, but it’s coming. It was just a lot of education, trying to raise awareness, let guys know how it’s transmitted, what the symptoms are.”  Said Ingles: “(The meeting) was pretty in-depth. With Quin’s meetings before that and then this one, that was the one that kind of woke everybody up I think. (Players were) like, ‘All right, this is serious, like we need to be responsible. Everyone needs to wash hands. If you’re feeling any symptoms or whatever, let people know.’”  Not everybody would heed the advice, of course.  As it turns out, that was also the day Gobert had his regrettable moment, touching the microphones of media members as he left his press conference after the morning shoot-around. It was a bad move, a practical joke gone wrong that was, in part, poking fun at the league’s new policy of keeping reporters six feet away from players during media interviews at that time.  But in the wake of all those COVID-19 lessons, it made it even harder to understand why he would do such a thing. What’s more, it wasn’t just the public who deemed his attitude toward the coronavirus irresponsible. There were members of his Jazz family who were disappointed by the message he was sending (Gobert, who has since apologized for his mistake on social media, declined to be interviewed for this story).  ## Gobert gets sick  In the few days before the Jazz’s trip to Oklahoma City on Tuesday, Gobert spent time with family in town from France and coincidentally began experiencing flulike symptoms. In the Monday night loss to the Raptors, he had six points, four rebounds, two steals and one block in 32 minutes, going 1 of 4 from the field and committing five fouls.  As the Tuesday afternoon trip commenced, teammates noticed Gobert coughing and showing the effects of whatever ailed him. Some of them encouraged him to treat his illness, prodding Gobert to skip the conventional medicines and teas and head straight to the trainers for a coronavirus test, according to sources. Yet Gobert, who believed he felt good enough to play in the Wednesday game against the Thunder, clearly didn’t see his symptoms as severe enough to warrant such a reaction.  Finally, however, he gave in, met with the training staff Wednesday morning and underwent the coronavirus test. Guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who was experiencing a runny nose, also underwent the coronavirus test. Both were held out of morning shootaround and listed as questionable for Wednesday night’s game, with illness serving as the official description.  Jazz officials were prodded by traveling media in the moments after shootaround to rule out coronavirus, because social media had already begun running rampant with speculation. It was the same thing Golden State media had done the previous week when Warriors star guard Stephen Curry missed time due to illness. The Jazz instructed the media to continue listing illness as the primary medical explanation.  For hours, the Jazz, Gobert and Mudiay waited on the results, with the Jazz working with Oklahoma health officials on expediting those results. In the meantime, Gobert continued to reiterate to the Jazz that he felt strong enough to play and was expecting to suit up, should he receive medical clearance.  Just minutes before tipoff of the 7:05 p.m. CT game against the Thunder, the results were in."
"&gt; OKCs offense dropped off After Westbrook’s injury, The offense consisted of KD/Kevin Martin/Reggie Jackson/Ibaka. Basically no shooters, No secondary playmakers/passers, no cutters, no real offensive system like the triangle. Of course the offensive rating would be low. Kobe in that lineup does worse.   ...... Are you genuinely joking?   This line up: KD/Kevin Martin/Reggie Jackson/Ibaka  Is not that far off from: Kobe/Fisher/Odom/Pau/Ramanovich.   Kobe in that system does far, far better. Considering Kobe's less offense tanked more in both reg season AND playoffs. But dur dur, ""system"" Fucking LOL  &gt; So citing Net +- As a crutch to claim a superstar (as the only real guy who can dribble 2 times in a row) as a negative demonstrates your inability to Contextualize Numbers.  No doofus, learn how to read again, as illustrated before,   the issue isn't him being a negative net plus-minus player, the issue is the awful offense that he lead.   From 2011-2013 in the playoffs, KD lead offense was awful, compared to the obvious legends, and he wasn't doing jack shit elevating the offense despite the pretty box stats. Although it looks much better from 2014-2016, IT WAS ACTUALLY RW that was impacting the offense at a far higher level. KD without RW in this stretch became his normal self.   From 2008-2010, Kobe was BY FAR the most impactful offensive player on his team, by every metric.    &gt; Kevin Durant without Stephen Curry in the lineup in GSW for the post season.  &gt; 2017-2019  &gt; +7 net, 114 Ortg  &gt; Kobe form 2008-2010  &gt; +6.42 net 113 ORtG  .............  KD without Curry, has Klay, Green, some of the best role players possible.   Kobe outside Pau had absolutely dogshit spacing with poor bench.... and Kobe comes out this similar?   My god LOL  &gt; Durant obviously more efficient from the floor, better shooter, better Defender too.  It’s close, Both top 10 all time candidates with Kobe Higher for me (Top 7ish).  &gt; &amp; I’m not even going to get into why RAPM is Very very inconclusive data. Just read Justin Jacobs 3 part paper on it.  RAPM is more correlative than BPM in tracking wins by significant margins. High sample RAPM DESTROYS bpm, and is currently the most correlative advance stats.   &gt; It’s close, Both top 10 all time candidates with Kobe Higher for me (Top 7ish).  LOL wtf?   Durant doesn't sniff top 10 LOL."

Good point.  The Stephen Curry/Kemba Walker/Dwyane Wade types never work out.

Shooting splits of 45/32/85 in the playoffs is not elite for a player like Kevin Durant. His field goal percentage in his last 3 seasons in OKC is 46/46/43 and his 3 point percentage is 31/34/28. This dude was almost always near 50/40/90 in the regular season. People actually forgot how bad he choked in the playoffs the second he won one of the easiest rings for a superstar in history.  And he was not obviously their best player. Stephen Curry is the most valuable player to the Warriors and the leader of the team.
PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Michael Jordan   SF: Larry Bird  PF: Lebron James  C: Kareem Abdul Jabber  I would want Miami Lebron in this lineup that was a little more post than perimeter. Bird and Curry need to provide the spacing for the team.
They literally practice with strobes. It's mentioned briefly early on here: https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/the-top-secret-tool-that-stephen-curry-uses-to-train-his-brain.html
"I think you overrate athleticism. If you consider track and field as a test of raw athletic ability, you'll find that most pro bball/football players weren't even the fastest running, highest jumping, or strongest athletes in their own high schools. There is obviously a minimum requirement of athletic ability involved, but the fact is, to be good at basketball, you have to be good at basketball; not good at jumping.  And the fact that a two time MVP, 6' 3"" athlete in Stephen Curry has difficulty in dunking, when I can find athletes all across the country who are under 6 feet who can effortlessely dunk, undercuts your argument."
Stephen Curry should've been there too
It does spill over sometimes though. Marcus Thompson wrote about how some nba players resented Steph in his book (https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/stephen-curry-book-marcus-thompson-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-dislike-warriors/19tkdxqaeo40p1598n07undcew). He threw out a couple of names like Russ and Bron but in one of the podcasts he did to promote the book (i believe it was the old basketball friends pod with espn) he specifically singled out CP3 as someone who really does not like him
Here's how Japanese Wikipedia romanizes it:  * ドラガン・ベンダー (Dragan Bender)  * カイ・ボウマン (Ky Bowman) * マーキース・クリス (Marquese Chriss)  * ステフィン・カリー (Stephen Curry) * ドレイモンド・グリーン (Draymond Green) * デイミオン・リー (Damion Lee) * ケヴォン・ルーニー (Kevon Looney) * マイカル・モンダー (Mychal Mulder)  * エリック・パスカル (Eric Paschall) * ジョーダン・プール (Jordan Poole) * チャソン・ランドル (Chasson Randle) * アレン・スマイラギッチ (Alen Smailagić) * クレイ・トンプソン (Klay Thompson) * ホアン・トスカーノ・アンダーソン (Juan Toscano-Anderson) * アンドリュー・ウィギンス (Andrew Wiggins)  They use fewer long vowels.

"The ive looked at his resume the more ive felt like rick barry is a top 20 player of all time.   He averaged 35ppg in a season which is something other great scorers like pete maravich/allen iverson/ elvin hayes never did in there high usage seasons.  He's one of the best passing forwards in nba history averaging nearly 6 assist per game for 6 years in his career from 1973-74 to 1978-79 and his career high of 19 assist is as high or higher than other great point forwards like lebron james(19),scottie pippen(15), larry bird(17),grant hill(14).   His career highest scoing game is 64 points which is higher than other scorers like george gervin(63),jerry west(63),carmelo anthony(62),tracy mgrady(62),damian lilard(61),james harden(61),lebron james(61),shaquille o'neal(61),karl malone(61)  but that is unstating 64 point, as he is the only player in nba history to make 30 field goals in a game besides wilt chamberlain.  People like to say that guys from the 60's-70's had 3 point range but rick barry actually has seasons where he was taking and hitting 3's such as his 1971-72 aba season where he was making 0.9 3 pointers a game and his final season where he made 1.0 threes a game,and he has made a total of 176 3 pointers on record, his career high in 3 pointers made at 8 is just as high as lebrons at 8, you can actually say that were he to play with a 3 pointer for his whole career that he would have scored more.  He's the best free throw shooter ever, while steve nash has the highest career free throw % at .904, he did while taking just 2.78 free throws a game or 3384 total free throws, but barrys career .893 is on a much larger sample size of  6.27 per game or 6397 which is a full 3013 more attempts.  His 1974-75 championship run is comparable to dirk and hakeems championship runs, although he didnt have to go through as many teams a dirk and hakeem, but his team was much worse than dirks 57 win mavericks or hakeems 58 win rockets while barrys  warriors were at just 48 wins while sweeping the 60 win washington bullets.  When he got his championship he got a finals mvp. When julius erving,stephen curry, scottie pippen,kevin garnett,david Robinson,jerry west,oscar Robertson,clyde drexler,kevin mchale got there chip they didnt get finals mvp, but berry did, so he should be more respected for getting a championship and finals mvp.  As one last thing for this wall of text, he never truly had to the opportunity to get an mvp which make him be perceived as a greater all time player and that his prime  in the aba and even then he was injury prone,when rick berry played the 1968-69 Oakland oaks were on pace for well over the the 60 wins which they got he played for his 35 games."
If that’s the case I’ll make the 2nd super team.  PG: Stephen Curry SG:James Harden  SF:Kevin Durant PF:Giannis C:Anthony Davis  6th: Kawhi Leonard 7th:Klay Thompson 8th: Russell Westbrook  HC: Pop
I'm going to say the reason is Stephen Curry is extremely skilled in the game of basketball...
"Stephen Curry Shot to tie or take lead final 45 seconds: 4/17 [source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=play&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;shot_distance_min=0&amp;q4=Y&amp;q5=Y&amp;time_remain_minutes=0&amp;time_remain_seconds=45&amp;time_remain_comp=le&amp;is_tying=Y&amp;is_go_ahead=Y&amp;player_id=curryst01&amp;order_by=fg)  Let's also mention among the shots you listed, the 2014 Clippers one was a foul and so was the 2019 Blazers one and are we really going to criticize him for missing against San Antonio game 1 2013 when he was triple teamed and had dropped 40+ at that point?. Are we really going to criticize him for missing the shot at game 4 vs Portland when he dropped 17 in overtime (nba record) afterwards? And are we really going to criticize him for not being going in ""crunchtime"" when he's had plenty of clutch overall shots otherwise (2015 game 3 vs pelicans, 2019 game 6 vs houston, 2016 game 6 and 7 vs thunder, 2015 game 3 and 5 vs Cleveland, 2019 game 5 vs raptors, 2018 game 7 vs houston just to name a few)"

"Dude the next face of the nba wont be a foreign player. Stephen A has being around long enough to know .. when MJ went to play baseball hakeem was the best player but was never the face of the league. Did duncan ever get considered as the face of the league?. Curry is gonna be the face till someone like zion or tatum matures to take the mantle. You think they really want an european to be the face of the nba ?. Lets be real here. Its not about being the best player alone. Its about having a good character, clout etc"
Thanks! Hmm...I wonder if Dell had the same form. He made a young Steph spend a whole summer [rebuilding his shot from scratch](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12728744/how-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-became-nba-best-point-guard) to shoot over his head instead of pulling from his hip.
If you use advanced stats curry is one of the best players of all time. I believe Stephen Curry’s plus-minus over the last five years is the best in NBA history.

"I know many to consider Tim Duncan as a top 10 player of all-time and the best or 2nd best power forward ever (Karl Malone being the argument for 1 or 2). I think he is somewhat the “Derek Jeter” of the NBA as far as legacies go. Model citizen, organization built for winning championships every year, solid coaching staff (Popovich being top 3 in NBA history, arguably 1 or 2), and other Hall of Fame talents around him during his career (Robinson, Parker, Ginobili, Leonard). Don’t get me wrong his numbers and accolades speak for themselves over his illustrious career but I believe many players in his era were more talented but in worse situations to win and/or not as compliant to play for a coach with a militaristic style. For example, I believe the following players in his era were far more talented despite position differences for some...LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, Jason Kidd, Jermaine O’Neal, Chris Webber, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Steve Nash, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul to name a few."
"1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Chris Paul 5. James Harden 6. Kwahi Leonard 7. Russell Westbrook 8. Paul George 9. Klay Thompson 10. Kyrie Irving  2nd and 3rd can switch, 4th to 7th can switch.    I will have Curry over Durant because I feel like the 73 win Warriors was so iconic. I also feel like Kawhi didn't play enough game, but I can see people put it as high as 4th.   Other Options:   1. Draymond Green, Kyle Lowry, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard   Just need a few more space 2. Antony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Kemba Walker   They were losing games  3.

Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Dewayne Wade, Kobe Bryant, Tony Parker, Steve Nash, Manu Ginobili, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams   They still had some great years, but they all fell off in the second half of the decade, like having troubles to make the playoffs 5.  Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid    They are only relevant in the second half of the decade"
I kinda like this list. It's the top 10 in VORP for the playoffs from 2009-10 to 2018-19 combined.  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Draymond Green  7. Chris Paul  8. Dwyane Wade  9. Russell Westbrook  10. Al Horford  Now I'd take off Draymond and Horford and replace them with Lowry and Dame I think and then shuffle it a bit. Maybe something like.  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Chris Paul  7. Russell Westbrook  8. Dame Lillard  9. Dwyane Wade  10. Kyle Lowry
Aaroon Gordon is your 2021 runner for 3pt competition after a draw between stephen curry. it's been decided that due to countback of previous years stephen curry wins.
Stephen Curry so good he's on two teams
That if a player wins against a heavily injured team that that is validation  of how talented that player is. In the modern era we use that to boost a players legacy and act as if that player had the requisite talent to beat a fully healthy team. The most notable benefactors in all this is Stephen Curry and Kawhi Leonard.
"I guess if you want your kid to be a great shooter, name him Stephen. Steve Kerr’s averages for his 5 seasons with theBulls were 50.7/47.9/85.4. And we all know Curry is a great shooter. All 3 named Stephen."

"From 2008-2011, you guys passed up on some amazing players. The 3 players, from 2008-2010, that was picked DIRECTLY after your picks were Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, &amp; Demarcus Cousins."
Stephen curry ate curry out his wife's ass  Man that's the type of shit you learn when you have an nba player for a dad
"just because you only saw 1 or 2 plays doesn't mean that's the only time it happened. no one is applying a concept based on a few highlights, you can look at any game over the past 5 years and see this, it's literally the engine of the warriors entire offense. this is backed up by metrics too https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/.   i swear it's guys like you and the one above who get hung up on those times you saw an open dunk in the finals and think ""well that doesn't happen every time, so clearly he's not actually doing that much and all this talk about gravity is bullshit""  why do you think the screening scheme works at all, and why do you think it was implemented in the first place? it's because it leverages shooters like steph and klay. he is absolutely creating offense by moving offball. a screen by itself doesn't cause any chaos, it's the shooter moving off that screen that draws defenders out of position. if all it took is a lot of screens to generate efficient offense, why aren't more teams playing like the warriors? edit: also, steph is one of the main and most effective screeners on the team as well. so talking about screens as if they exist separate from the players doesn't make any sense  saying harden is a significantly superior passer is your value judgement, so whatever. I don't usually agree with what you think anyways"
Stephen curry was so fun to watch that season. I didn’t watch as much of that season as I did the 2017-2018 nba season. The 2017-18 season was a blast for me.
"&gt; Non-American - Favorite player is Stephen Curry. Is OOTL of most NBA memes/pop culture. Tried to become a more serious fan after the 2016 Finals. Doesn't curse much in his comments.  Most of the Euro fans have sleeping disorder because of the time difference. They are the real G's, especially those who root for Western teams, stay until morning to watch the games live despite of those long commercial breaks and get annoyed when media members occasionally say they didn't watch the Western conference games due to being ""late""."

2016 Finals- Irving 27.1 ppg on 47% 40% 94% shooting splits while playing 40 minutes per game and hitting the most clutch shoot in finals history. Get the hell outta my face with that man shall I add he did this against a 73-9 team led by the greatest shooter ever known as Stephen Curry who was the current back to back mvp and first ever unanimous. Irving’s 2016 finals performance was one of the most efficient I’ve ever seen from any guard in history. He’s not overrated he’s overhated
"Imagine a mechanized cyborg made by splicing the DNA of Larry Bird and Stephen Curry, uploaded with the programming of Kawhi Leonard."
"I won't restrict myself with that kind of true position. Though having LeBron at PG is not nice. So, I'll do it with players who could play that secondary position.        The ones I can think of;      1971-72   PG: Walt Frazier   SG: Jerry West   SF: John Havlicek   PF: Wilt Chamberlain   C: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar      1986-87   PG: Magic Johnson   SG: Michael Jordan   SF: Larry Bird   PF: Kevin McHale   C: Hakeem Olajuwon      1992-93 (Basically the Dream Team with Hakeem instead of Ewing and Robinson)   PG: John Stockton   SG: Michael Jordan   SF: Charles Barkley   PF: Karl Malone   C: Hakeem Olajuwon      2002-03   PG: Jason Kidd   SG: Kobe Bryant or Tracy McGrady   SF: Kevin Garnett   PF: Tim Duncan   C: Shaquille O'Neal      2017-18   PG: Stephen Curry   SG: James Harden   SF: Kevin Durant   PF: LeBron James   C: Anthony Davis   (Actually I wanted to go with 2015-16, have Kawhi in there. But the gap between AD and DeAndre or Whiteside was far bigger than the gap between Kawhi and Harden.)      I think 1971-72, 1992-93 and 2002-03 are better than 1986-87 and 2017-18. But it's too hard to pick one from those 3."

"I’ve watched Literally every warriors game since 2014, and Every playoff game as well. Stephen Curry literally does not see the same defense  pre KD as he did with KD. The Steph Dray PnR in the playoffs is More efficient W/ KD on floor. Just rewatch The finals game 5 with KD on the court, Steph scored 15 quick points in the first quarter..... He doesn’t have the same attention with KD on the court. Steph also gets substantially more open shots with KD on the floor than without"

"I thought Stephen Curry would just be a role player in the NBA.   Me, watching Curry in college: Look at this, he’s just chucking it. No way he does that in the league."
Stephen Curry was injured.
It is comical that people don’t believe or argue these 2 obvious and conclusive facts about Stephen Curry:  1. He is the best 3-point shooter of all-time. 2. He is definitely a top 5 point guard of all-time already.
"As Doc Rivers suggested last [season](https://www.knbr.com/2019/04/13/rivers-i-still-think-steph-curry-is-one-of-the-most-underrated-players-in-the-nba/), [twice](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2838436-doc-rivers-stephen-curry-doesnt-get-enough-credit-for-his-warriors-greatness), Steph is under appreciated."
"That’s Stephen Curry, Leo. You played with him two seasons."

So if that’s the case when Stephen Curry retires he should be Greatest of All Time after Jordan because he changed the game the most
"Al Jefferson was 22 and coming off a 16-11 season. Gerald Green was 21 and considered a risky prospect with high upside potential.  The prospects just didn’t pan out, it happens.  If Minnesota knew how to draft and didn’t take Johnny Flynn with the 6th pick we traded them it would’ve looked completely different. That Stephen Curry guy would’ve been a good choice there."

"I think a shot of Iverson stepping over Lue is pretty iconic in 2001. One man trying to score enough points for rest of his defensive minded teammates.  The other one is Stephen Curry sitting on the ground after Klay's injury. Opposite end of the court. That was it. The Warriors could have maybe won with Klay or Kevin, but without either? It was over. And Curry knew it.      Link to the Reddit Thread for the second one: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c0nfru/a_frustrated_steph_curry_sits_at_the_other_end_of/"

"This is a weird thread justifying this hey. If you shoot either (ignoring turnovers because they're very unlikely):  1.  You make it and they miss (win) * You make it and they score (OT) * You miss it and they score (loss) * You make it and they miss (OT)  If you don't shoot it till the last shot:  1. You make it (win) * You miss it (OT)  Stephen Curry shot 48% on wide open 3s during his 2015-16 MVP season, that is certainly not worth shooting for J.R. Smith who shot 42% on the same type of shots in the season of that game. Opponents will have effectively a full shot clock after using timeout to advance the ball."
Stephen Curry 'cause the Warriors had a better record and he posted the greatest three-point shooting season of all time
Stephen Curry
"The 2018 rockets are a top 10 team of all time. When CP3 Capela and Harden were healthy (Capela and CP3 missed almost a quarter of the season each), the rockets went 50-5  50-5   They lost to four all stars and igoudala and looney in 7 games. They lost to Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green in 7 with CP3 missing two games. That’s a top ten team of all time"
"Yeah, I think stats heavily favored KD since he already blossom since the start of the decade while Steph was a rookie but if you really watching those finals, not even in finals even in playoffs, Steph was GSW guy. Even with the FMVPs, you can't tell me that KD was the best player in GSW. KD wasn't getting that open shots in OKC even playing with another MVP caliber point guard now ""magically"" shoots up his TS% with GSW. Huh I wonder why oh yeah, Stephen fuckin Curry."

Stephen Curry is still the best.
"Steph has been better than KD since his first MVP.  Certainly he has been better on offense, and in my opinion that gap is bigger than the defensive gap.   Offensive impact comes down to how well you score individually and how well you help your teammates score (either through assists, or screens, drawing double teams, etc.) As scorers they have been roughly equal, Steph's edge in efficiency is roughly as valuable as KD's edge in volume.  However, Steph has a substantial edge in how much he helps his teammates score.    Scoring is all about how many points you can score and how many possessions you use to score those points.  They're pretty much equals here, over their careers Steph averages 23.5 points on 18.8 true shot attempts (best easily calculable measure of possessions used) while KD averages 27.0 points on 22.1 TSA per game.  So KD is giving you 3.5 more points on 3.2 more possessions, a TS of 55.1% - pretty much league average.  So most teams should be pretty much indifferent between the 3.5 more points KD gives and the 3.2 additional possessions he uses to get those points.    Steph does a lot more to improve his teammates than KD.  He is consistently top (or among the top 3 or so with LeBron and Harden) in the league at improving his teammates efficiency.  KD is not.  Considering even the highest volume players of all time top out at around 40% usage, improving teammates' efficiency is (significantly) more important than scoring yourself.  See for example [this graph](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,f_auto,h_912,w_672/https%3A%2F%2Ffansided.com%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F03%2F04-Curry-PG-Teammate-TS.jpg) and [this graph] (https://fansided.com/files/2018/03/05-Curry-PG-Teammate-TS-vs-TS.jpg) in [this article](https://fansided.com/2018/03/26/nylon-calculus-evolution-stephen-curry-pure-point-guard/) or [this graph](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/morris-mvp-curry-0412-2.png?w=1150) in [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/)."

"&gt; Tennis has been slower on courts for 15+ years bud.   So you're saying there's a change? And 15 years is not a long time, not to mention the numerous changes that took place between 80s, 90s, and 2000s.   &gt; The same guys dominate, the same courts are about the same speed, and it depends where you play and what time of year.  With sentences this vague I wonder if you watch tennis at all.   &gt; Usain Bolt set the record in 2009, 11 years ago. He holds the top two spots. Michael Johnson holds the next two spots from 1996. The fifth spot is from 1979.  You do realize using Usain Bolt as an example shows what a moron you are? He is a modern runner. Your Michael Johnson example is completely irrelevant when we are discussing the AVERAGE increase in athleticism. Just compare records of 100 meter race from this decade to what it was in the 90s.   &gt; What has been proven here is that your conditioning fallacy is mostly bullshit. Players stay healthier for longer periods, but they don't actually run much longer or faster than they did before.  All you did was look at the top players rather than the average? Why? Because you are not very bright. Also look at average height, average wingspan, average lateral speed, average weight lifting, etc. Those have all increased in the NBA. Even Stephen Curry is buff by 90s standard.   &gt; ""Practically ever professional..."" Let me just stop you there in the middle of your bullshit fallacy. You have no data to back this up  Yeah only the words of Federer, Raonic, Williams sisters, Djokovic, Sampras, Roddick, Murray, Hewitt, Agassi, etc. all Wimbledon semi finalists or winners."
Sorry he went 3-16. The guy is also 0-10 on game winners in the playoffs. Why do only curry stans  care  about ts%? No other fan base does this.  Only thing they can bring up since the guy doesn’t have one leadership bone in his body and one of the least clutch players in nba playoff history   https://www.complex.com/sports/stephen-curry-worst-nba-finals-performances/game-1-2016-finals
"The award is only for 1 series. It isn't for the entire playoffs, otherwise guys like iggy and kawhi in 2014 have no shot at winning. usually it goes to the best player anyways, but in years like 2014 and 15 it doesn't.   Of course he was still deserving of the finals mvp lol, he's fucking steph curry. but you also have to remember he wasn't the clear top 3 player like we've viewed him the last 3 or 4 years. He was new.  at the time iggy was playing well on both ends, guarding the best player in the world, and giving the team a boost after they went down 1-2 vs a much worse team. It wasn't some huge upset that curry didn't win, like people are making it sound now.   &gt; Voting is opinion and can be debated upon,  only if someone you didn't want to win got an award. otherwise this doesn't make sense. This isn't like all-star voting.   &gt;  attention Curry draws from a defense. it should be obvious who the better offensive player was in the closeout game.   best players on every team always draw the most attention, that isn't unique to curry. Of course curry was the best offensive player on the team, but iggy was going off for 20+ in the 3 straight wins and was guarding bron. There is more to basketball than scoring, and curry was not his dominant self offensively in every game and didn't impact the game on defense. You are acting like it was obvious curry was mvp but that wasn't the case.   &gt; Karl Malone, David Robinson, Julius Erving are players either in the top 15 or on the borderline.  These guys are fringe top 15 guys. Dr.J was in the ABA at first lol. Not having a ring definitely hurts Malone. He'd be ranked way higher if he won.  &gt; The triple doubles were cool but it obscures what his greater value was.  my point was oscar wasn't part of good teams until late in his career when he went to milwaukee. Only won more than 50 games once until he went to milwaukee. So he was remembered more for his individual play than what he accomplished as a team.    &gt; I agree. So surely you can extend this leeway to Stephen Curry.  that's why I mentioned KG. because you said you said you can argue steph as the best player in 2015. But just like with curry, KG would be ranked higher with a finals MVP. It's just how it is at the top."
"If, in 2020, you still think John Stockton was better than Stephen Curry idk what to tell you other than i'm sorry that your parents dropped you on your head as a kid"
"Gravity isn't intangible.  It is measurable and manifests itself in how Steph does a lot more to improve his teammates offensively than KD.    Steph is consistently top (or among the top 3 or so with LeBron and Harden) in the league at improving his teammates efficiency.  KD is not.  Considering even the highest volume players of all time top out at around 40% usage, improving teammates' efficiency is (significantly) more important than scoring yourself.

"Doesn't mean he wasn't deserving of winning FMVP. He was also clearly the Warriors MVP for the season including the postseason as a whole. Consider this similar to a great player not winning MVP despite having a MVP level season, not winning DPOY despite having DPOY level seasons, not making All-NBA despite having an All-NBA season, so on and so forth. Voting is opinion and can be debated upon, not to be taken as truth for who the best player in a series was.  I'd implore you to consider how differently Iguodala and Curry score 25 in a given game, and to also consider that the Warriors base their offense around the attention Curry draws from a defense. It should be obvious who the better offensive player was in the closeout game. And should be obvious who the Warriors best offensive player in the series was by a mile.  &gt;can you name them? I don't think there are that many more.  Karl Malone, David Robinson, Julius Erving are players either in the top 15 or on the borderline. Malone of course has no titles all together.   Oscar didn't even reach the finals until '71 with Kareem. Also, he's in the top 15 more so because he led dominant offenses in almost every year of his prime even surpassing that of Wilt Chamberlain in his own time. Good argument that he was better offensively than Wilt. The triple doubles were cool but it obscures what his greater value was.  &gt;KG was arguably the best in 08 anyways  I agree. So surely you can extend this leeway to Stephen Curry."
"ESPN: NBA superstars LeBron James, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry held private conference call on Monday and established united front in favor of Giannis Antetokounmpo joining their respective teams"
"As someone who thinks Steph &gt; Durant, I'll give my reasoning.  I think that in a 1v1 situation, Durant could be argued as being the best player ever almost, but basketball is 5v5. Curry has a much better ability to make his teammates better than Durant does. (I'd check out a part of this article that talks about how Curry improves his teammates TS% when he's on the court  [https://fansided.com/2018/03/26/nylon-calculus-evolution-stephen-curry-pure-point-guard/](https://fansided.com/2018/03/26/nylon-calculus-evolution-stephen-curry-pure-point-guard/) ). I also think that Curry is the better passer of the two.  Durant is a better volume scorer and does so extremely efficiently (albeit slightly less efficiently than Curry). Durant is also the better defender, but that's an area both aren't great at.  Overall, I would rank them very closely (probably within 5 of each other all time), but I'd give the nod to Curry because his offensive gravity is able to make everyone on his team better in a way Durant doesn't, even if Durant is individually a more skilled scorer. Unfortunately it's difficult to measure the intangible of ""gravity"" though, but that's really what puts  him slightly ahead of Durant IMO."
"Just because you call it ""muh gravity"" doesn't make it fake.  It's very real and has a very real impact on his team.  Steph is significantly better than KD at his teammates on offense, partially due to better looks generated by how defenses have to defend Steph.    You can see this by the amount Steph improves his teammates' efficiency when he plays, he's consistently tops in the league at that.  Which is huge, Steph and KD take about 1/3 of the shots when they're on the floor - that means that twice as many shots are taken by their teammates.  Steph and KD are pretty equal on their own scoring, but for the other 2/3s of the scoring, Steph has significantly bigger impact.    And yes, this isn't just a bs narrative it is quantifiable (or at least the effect is, calling it ""gravity"" is arbitrary) see for example [this graph](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,f_auto,h_912,w_672/https%3A%2F%2Ffansided.com%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F03%2F04-Curry-PG-Teammate-TS.jpg) and [this graph] (https://fansided.com/files/2018/03/05-Curry-PG-Teammate-TS-vs-TS.jpg) in [this article](https://fansided.com/2018/03/26/nylon-calculus-evolution-stephen-curry-pure-point-guard/) or [this graph](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/morris-mvp-curry-0412-2.png?w=1150) in [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/)."

"He’s not standing idly by, he stunts right there. Why doesn’t he commit fully? Because he still sees Zaza. So now it’s a guessing game between Zaza and Klay.

Pretending like a guy on the baseline is so afraid of Stephen Curry moving on the PERIMETER is absolutely ridiculously laughable. Like come on, am I being trolled here?   He’s standing right where Durant is coming up and follows his movement up. Curry moves towards him, and like any good defender, he pushes up to be able to guard two people at once. What are you talking about?   The rotation doesn’t come from one corner because he’s confused because of Klay. The other corner because it’s transition.   Stop it. Just stop."

That time when Stephen Curry ripped the ball out of Joakim Noah’s hands in the backcourt and threw an alley oop.
"Sure thing. I also failed to mention that I incorporated Win Shares as well as games played, since nobody makes the Hall as a player on only a couple of peak seasons.   Three caveats to the list:   1. For anyone upset with MJ at #5, those years playing baseball hurt him in basically every category as he wasn't adding to his already impressive list of accolades (would've meant additional All-Stars, All-NBAs, Win Shares, Gs Played and potentially All-Defense). Similarly, Magic is hurt by having his career interrupted/cut short by HIV. 2. Finding a list of all players with an NBA championship is very difficult and would be very time-consuming (and manual) for me, so while it contributes to the overall score of each player, the list of players that have titles to their names is incomplete (particularly if they have just 1), so the list should definitely be considered a work-in-progress. 3. It is a ranking of careers, not talent or peak skill level. So if you think I have slighted Wilt or Bill Russell in any way, just know that every single player in the top-21 of this list has double-digit All-Stars, 9+ All-NBA (10+ if you exclude KG) and several have double-digit All-Defense selections as well. I elected to make MVP, DPOY and ROY binary as this was originally intended to be predictive of Hall consideration and haven't revisited that decision since, though there is probably a good case to do so as multiple MVPs is indicative of a very impressive career. So, again, work in progress.  Without further ado, here is the list (as well as the scores for the top-20):  1. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (43.37) 2. Tim Duncan (42.23) 3. Kobe Bryant (40.76) 4.

"The thing is, though, that if you're running your offense through Jimmy Butler, that means you're not running your offense through one of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, or Luka Doncic--all of whom are better at running an offense than Jimmy.

Russell Westbrook is a better all around basketball player than Stephen Curry.   Caveat: He is also overly emotional too often and plays himself out of the game. Really holds him back from reaching the highest of heights.
"* Some nephews need to stop harping on about one-motion/two-motion jumpshots.  It's probably something that they heard from Coach Nick and parrot it whenever they can.  Every player is not the same.  You can't automatically make assumptions based on shooting form.   * Rockets fans are insufferable when it comes to Harden.  Nobody denies his greatness. The problem we all have with him is that he manipulates the refs too much.  It may be a 'smart' approach, but it is a shameful one.   * The 2017 Golden State Warriors are not the greatest team ever.  Curry can be neutralized with physicality as seen in 2016 Finals.  Kevin Durant will cook anyone, Klay can get hot against anyone, but Stephen Curry needs to be rolling for those Warriors to be the best team ever.  Also Curry would get wrecked by hand checking. * The 2002 Sacramento Kings were not robbed.  They had multiple opportunities to put the Lakers away in Game 7 and straight up choked. * Steve Nash is overrated.  His defense was abysmal.  You can't be in talks of the best point guard ever if you only play one side of the ball. * Dirk Nowitzki is not better than Kevin Garnett or even Chris Webber.  He was a better shooter and was lucky to have good team management.  That's it. * Hakeem Olajuwon cannot dribble like a guard.  Stop saying this, he can't. Doing a crossover side to side from the post is one thing.  Dribbling up the length of the court through traffic is another. * Chris Bosh is not an all-time great.  He is a nice man and was a very good player.  His defense was not that good until he got to Miami.  His scoring was inconsistent as the main guy.  A team led by him would not go anywhere.  Being part of a championship team does not elevate him to Hall of Fame status.   * Magic Johnson and Larry Bird cannot be in the conversation for best player of all time.  Michael Jordan is so revered because of his excellence on both sides of the ball.  Magic and Larry did not have that type of impact on defense.  They simply did not have the athleticism.  Athleticism does not always matter on offense, but on defense it does.  It's not everything, but it is very important when it comes to defense. * Kobe Bryant was not the greatest player of his era.  Neither was Tim Duncan.  Nor Shaquille O'Neal.  They all took turns flourishing as the man in the league and showed their quality of the course of their careers.  Who was the greatest player of that era? No one.  They were all at about the same level in terms of accomplishments and impact.   * Grant Hill would not have been in GOAT conversations if he had stayed healthy.  He accomplished diddly in the playoffs for the first half of his career.  He was a uniquely talented player, but you need a lot more than that to crack the top 10 of all time list.   * Brandon Roy is not that big of a what if.  He was very good and had a complete offensive game.  People talk about him like he was next in line after Kobe.  He was not the kind of player that can carry a franchise on his back.  What do I mean?  Look at Paul Pierce.   * People need to stop bringing up Kareem in GOAT debates.  He failed to lead his team to the playoffs in his prime.  After his first championship, he didn't accomplish much playoff success until Magic Johnson came around.  Magic Johnson was driving the car so to speak for the last several seasons of Kareem's career. * The only reason Kobe isn't ranked higher on most people's list is because of the weird trajectory his career had.  Also, he didn't come off the bench in the beginning because he sucked.  If he had been handed the keys right from the start, he probably could have averaged around 18 ppg as a rookie straight out of high school.  He was that good.  The team would have sucked, but he would have shown his scoring prowess right away.  The 2006 first round playoff exit was not his fault, it was Kwame's for missing a box out.  Yes, he did quit in Game 7. * LBJ can never surpass MJ because he has too many moments where he quit on his team.  2010 against the Celtics, 2011 in the Finals (although it was more of a disappearing act), end of 2014 Finals, last game of 2017 Finals.  As amazing as he is, that's too many times for a player of his stature. * Karl Malone is not as great as his records suggest.  He was very good for a very long time.  He struggled in clutch moments and he was fortunate that he had stability in Sloan and Stockton for most of his career.  He never had to jockey for position on his own team as he was the undisputed featured player every year and had an unselfish co-star.  Being the primary scoring option for the team + no injuries + a lot of years = impressive totals.   * Antoine Walker is a failed cyborg from the future who went back in time to play basketball in the early 2000s NBA."

"The trade scenario came more than halfway through a 7,000-word Bleacher Report story outlining potential deals for all 30 NBA teams’ top players: Andrew Wiggins and three of the Warriors’ future first-round picks to the Bucks for Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Within hours of the article’s publication last week, that hypothetical move rippled through the blogosphere, delighting Golden State fans who view Antetokounmpo as the ideal prize after a league-worst season. Never mind that the trade in question was wholly unrealistic. As they near their second month without sports because of the coronavirus pandemic, many fans are desperate for something — anything — to command their attention.   But even though Milwaukee would require a much better haul than Wiggins and three draft picks to part with Antetokounmpo, it might have to start considering offers for him in coming months. Trading Antetokounmpo for a package of assets would be far more palatable than letting him leave as an unrestricted free agent in 2021 if he declines the Bucks’ supermax extension this summer — a five-year deal that could be worth $254 million.  Though all indications are that he’s on good terms with team management, league sources believe that Antetokounmpo would want out of Milwaukee if he loses confidence in the franchise’s ability to win championships. This is why the NBA shutdown could buoy the Warriors’ chances of landing their long-coveted Greek.  When play was suspended March 11, the Bucks were a league-best 53-12. A canceled postseason — a distinct possibility given the slew of obstacles the NBA must overcome to resume play — would rob Milwaukee of a shot at its first title since 1971. There are no guarantees that the Bucks again will avoid major injury next season.  If the NBA is able to have the playoffs, it almost certainly would need to shorten each series to a maximum of five games. That ups the odds of an upset. Should Milwaukee — fresh off a long hiatus — get ousted in an abbreviated first or second round, Antetokounmpo might be be less likely to ink his extension this year.  The Bucks will do whatever they can to keep the face of their franchise long-term, but they recognize that the Warriors could offer probably the best package if Antetokounmpo decides he wants to leave. As last week’s Bleacher Report story suggested, Golden State can dangle Wiggins, a 2020 first-round pick expected to fall no lower than No. 5, Minnesota’s top-3-protected 2021 first-rounder and the Warriors’ 2022 first-rounder.  What would separate Golden State from other suitors, however, is that it could include Klay Thompson or Draymond Green in any potential trade. That would be a steep price, especially if the Bucks make Antetokounmpo available this offseason. Parting with multiple lottery picks, a starting small forward (Wiggins) and a cornerstone of an NBA dynasty (Thompson or Green) is quite a risk to acquire someone entering the final year of his contract.  But according to a league source, the Warriors have been preparing for years to make a bid for Antetokounmpo. General manager Bob Myers knows that to chart a course for long-term greatness, a team must maintain flexibility — both in terms of its roster and future assets.  By orchestrating a complex sign-and-trade last summer with Brooklyn for guard D’Angelo Russell, the Warriors got younger while obtaining a key trade chip. In February, when negotiating the deal that sent Russell to the Timberwolves, Myers made sure that Minnesota included a lightly protected pick in what’s expected to be a loaded 2021 draft.  This is the same type of advanced planning that helped the Warriors land Kevin Durant in free agency in July 2016.  To add Durant, the Warriors needed to clear enough space to accommodate his two-year, $54.3 million contract. Now, as it waits to see whether Antetokounmpo signs his extension with Milwaukee, Golden State reckons it has stockpiled enough assets to get it on the phone with Bucks general manager Jon Horst should Antetokounmpo become available.  And the asking price would be staggering. Last summer, to acquire Anthony Davis after he publicly demanded a trade from New Orleans, the Lakers gave up Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round picks — including the No. 4 overall pick in the 2019 draft (De’Andre Hunter). As special as Davis is, Antetokounmpo is better. This is someone who, at just 25, is well-positioned for his second straight MVP award. With Thompson, Green and Stephen Curry each in his early 30s, Antetokounmpo represents a chance for the Warriors to follow the Spurs’ model for sustained success.  It’s easy for Golden State to envision Antetokounmpo forming the league’s most daunting tandem alongside Curry, whom he already considers a friend. The two share an agency and in March, when asked to name his five favorite players in NBA history, Antetokounmpo twice named Curry. Three weeks later, Antetokounmpo chose the Warriors for a game of NBA 2K20 and touted Curry as “the OG.”  Such praise amplified the chatter surrounding Antetokounmpo and Golden State. What makes this Giannis-to-Warriors speculation intriguing, however, is that it’s not merely fantasy.  As ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne said on “The Jump” in September, Golden State has “always been the big threat” to the Bucks in the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes. Last week, when he tweeted that “chasing greatness is a life mission,” Antetokounmpo left little room for interpretation.  He will do whatever he must do to win at the highest level, even if that means leaving the team that drafted him for one fresh off a dynasty."
"2002 team is pretty damn stacked and balanced. I know the 2003 team gets more love, but having Kidd to run the offense instead of KG out there makes this team more well-rounded.  F: Tim Duncan   F: Tracy McGrady   C: Shaquille O'Neal   G: Kobe Bryant   G: Jason Kidd  Also, I know this is kinda cheating, but a revised version of the 2016 All-NBA teams would produce a really dominant lineup.  F: LeBron James  F: Kawhi Leonard  C: DeAndre Jordan ==&gt; Draymond Green  G: Stephen Curry  G: Russell Westbrook ==&gt; Kevin Durant  Draymond could knock down 3s that year and played DPOY level defense in the playoffs and regular season. I know people are going to clamor about Hakeem cooking him, but damn this lineup would be God-level small ball play."
Stephen Curry
"You can't make this shit up. Haters are saying it will never happen but there are too many signs indicating that it will.   - Steph alley oop to Giannis in the All Star game  - Steph to Giannis post game ""let's do this""  - Giannis on his favorite player: ""Stephen Curry""  - The team Giannis uses in 2k: Golden State  WELCOME TO GOLDEN STATE BABY. Y'all stay mad. IdgaFUCK if it's impossible, it's still happening anyways. We're back bitch. Embiid you're next."
"**2014-15:**  F: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers  F: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans  C: Marc Gasol, Memphis Grizzlies  G: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  G: James Harden, Houston Rockets  **2014-15 with a healthy Kevin Durant at F and Davis at C:**  F: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers  F: Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder  C: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans  G: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  G: James Harden, Houston Rockets  That would be the best shooting team of all time right there.  Soft on guard defense, but able to switch everything."
Who is Stephen Curry? In detail without using his name.
"I think a lot of the modern teams would beat this team in a game. For example, 14-15.  * F: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers * F: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans * C: Marc Gasol, Memphis Grizzlies * G: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors * G: James Harden, Houston Rockets  Bird / Barkley can't hope to guard Davis  / James. Gasol matches up well against Hakeem. Jordan and Magic are more physical than Harden / Curry but Harden and Curry are better shooters."
"brooooooooooooo where did i say he's the goat? i said he's number 2 behind jordan.   But if we're being honest, i wasn't watching the NBA when Jordan was dominating, so the argument for Kobe being the GOAT to me is that, yeah everyone says Jordan's the GOAT, but i didnt see the dude play, so who am I to gauge how great he was? I can only gauge the greatness of players I've watched so i can get the full story.   From what I've seen, Kobe was the best player, and to me he's my goat. If people want to say Jordan's the consensus goat thats great, it makes Kobe's argument for #2 even greater.   Stephen curry is the greatest offensive force of the modern era. you stop that, just like earlier playoffs for Jordan saw him getting all the defensive attention, and you have a chance, like those earlier teams that made it past Jordan. Again, except here, the greatest offensive force has KD to pass to. A Curry 3 is more demoralizing than letting a 7 footer who shoots takes a midrange  edit: ill make it simpler for you. Double team KD and the cavs get blown out the water every game before the end of the third by curry. double team curry and the cavs just get beat by an open KD. but like i said, if you wanna argue KD's better, fine, but he'll never end up higher on the GOAT list than Steph. KD will always be the third best SF, he'll never reach higher. Especially post achilles. Curry is #2 pg and has a sliver of a chance to pass magic during his career"
...go on go on. please tell me about that! that eliminates him? Youre so insightful.   Not. KD can be argued as the best player on those Warriors teams (which he wasn't) and he will still never end up higher on the GOAT list than stephen curry (:
Stephen Curry is an above average to good defender for his position and even led the league in steals a few years ago.   During his first MVP season he was 2nd in DRPM among point guards. In his second MVP season he was 6th among point guards in DRPM.
In no order:  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  James Harden  Luka Doncic  Nikola Jokic  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant
"That might be the problem. It's like comparing LaMarcus Aldridge to Tim Duncan. Both spent years on the Spurs, both were PF/Cs with good post and midrange games, both were good for 20/10 nights on about .500 eFG%. But it's not just styles that make players - quality does as well. Jimmer Fredette is an off-the-dribble, long range 3-point shooting point guard. Stephen Curry is an off-the-dribble, long range 3-point shooting point guard. But only one of them is balling in Greece. Ty Lue and Phil Jackson might have superficial or stylistic similarities, but that probably only goes skin deep."
"I’d love to see Trae Young against a defense that can hand-check and be more physical. I wonder if he’d be nearly as effective.   For example, we saw how Stephen Curry had to adjust his game in the NBA Finals when a lot more physicality is allowed."
Stephen Curry would be disappointed
Stephen Curry might be good at playing Basketball
To think that is only 1 inch taller than Stephen Curry
"Fun fact: Since 2011 Derrick Rose is the only first team all NBA player Lebron James faced in the playoffs in the Eastern Conference. For comparison, Damian Lillard *in the 2019 playoffs alone* face three players (Paul George, Nikola Jokic, Stephen Curry) in the Western Conference.   I think there's a debate to be had about who really had the easiest road."
"Nah, you don't know what you're saying. If you have played sports you know.  It's true that Messi worked soooo hard. But NOBODY working 10 times harder as him, can be him.  Same with Stephen Curry and his shooting.  Same with Magic, Bron... With passing.  They worked A LOT, but you have to be born different.   For example, I played what you Americans call soccer. I made it to semi pro and had to retire because two serious ankel injuries. I was born with the shooting and the pace gift. I didn't train how to be faster or have a canon. I was just born that way.  And when you go to see kids games you can see who has born with what skills. Then, is time to practice. But same as you are genetically stronger or taller, you are also genetically gifted in some areas.  Besides, we, people from Spain know that Navarro lacked the work ethics of Pau Gasol for example. We all know he didn't like to run, practice... Believe, he was born with the shooting touch"

"When Stephen Curry made 402 3's in 2015-2016, who was the previous record holder for most threes in a season?  Reggie Miller, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Ray Allen"
"Harden's last 5 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) have ended by him losing breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard, and losing to a warriors team without kd and giving up 33 second half points to Stephen Curry who was scoreless in the first half of an elimination game in Toyota Center. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019: Harden shoot 11-25 from the field, 58.3% from free throws ([3rd worst game of this season by FT%](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bn7vhu/hardens_712_from_the_ft_line_is_in_line_with_the/)) and caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."

It’s crazy because people respected that one year he won MVP cos it was pretty unreal to put up a 31/10/10 line. It was also a career year from 3pt range for him which was still a lowly 34% but still.   Once he did it second year it became normal and people were less impressed which I guess is to be understandable. Much the same as “Stephen Curry hit 7 threes today. Oh I guess that’s nice” because the absurd shit they’ve done has become the standard.   In his third year people were just attacking the fuck out of him for apparently stat padding and not playing for his team. Which to me is stupid as shit. He’d long been the best rebounding guard. In the league. Pretty much from his first season. He averaged 4.5 - 5 rebounds each year. Which was big for a PG not named Jason Kidd at the time. The year KD went down and got hurt. He averaged 7.8 rebounds. So for him to follow it up with a triple double average wasn’t like he was stealing 8 out of the 10 boards he averaged. He was only stealing 2-3 a night. But even then. He was just competing. And winning loose balls. Which is what you want.   I’m going to seem bias. But the way this guy does what everyone literally said was impossible, so easily is ridiculous. On a Houston team as a secondary option, he is averaging 27.5 / 8 / 7 on a majorly improved career high 47.3% shooting which is actually efficient by league standard. Not  just by his standard.   To put up 8 boards and 7 assists a night playing alongside the most ball dominant player ever, as well as having played alongside Capela for a chunk of games, this is unreal and shows he’s just a stat getter regardless. Some players go and dominate. Some fall into systems and structures. Both are fine. But the individuals who chase the ball do great things.   If you think he’s stealing too many rebounds. Tell his team mates to stop being weak rebounders. If you think he’s running up fake assists. Then I dunno, tell the shooters to miss shots"
"&gt; Oh so just like how all the old heads said Curry is hurting the game by hoisting up contested 3's and being a 3 point heavy oriented offensive player?   Yeah, exactly like that.  Curry is unbelievable, but kids at camps are hoisting 50 footers for not reason.  It is changing the game in a negative and boring way.  [There are legit people out there who say his style is hurting the game by the effect it has on kids.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/12/26/abc-analyst-mark-jackson-on-stephen-curry-hes-hurt-the-game/)  When Jordan was ""the man"" in the NBA, and all the kids wanted to be like him, he inspired a generation of Kobes and LeBrons and Melos.  Steph is inspiring kids to be lazy and take shitty threes.  The worst thing about Stephs game is how freaking good he is, it honestly seems effortless.  He is too good and kids don't realize that.   Additionally, the continued focus on analytics will bring the game to a screeching halt and will become super boring like baseball."
&gt;First MVP named Stephen Wardell Curry to foul out of an NBA Finals game.
"If we want to be super technical with the term then the worst shot selector is one of Stephen Curry, Trae Young, Damian Lillard or Kevin Durant. They all consistently take ridiculous shots. Curry launches from the logo at will. So does Trae. Dame does stepback logo threes in playoff buzzer beater attempts. Durant takes way too many contested awkward mid range / long twos.  A regular player should never attempt such shots. They attempt those regularly.  They obviously make them at ridiculous clips and this is why they are who they are. But again, if we want to be super technical about the term, their shot selection is atrocious."

Wasn’t a scorer, but PGs don’t need to be when they get 14 assists regularly."
"So your argument is that Curry played 1 less game and wasn't as ball dominant (which is easily explained by him being the GOAT offball player and Harden nothing special offball)? That Curry was a better passer and more efficient scorer on slightly lesser volume (mpg hurts him here)?  The MVP has never been a ""who carried harder"" award . Curry played less minutes because he sat quarters - the team posted a +10.2 margin of victory (2nd was 6.4+ Spurs). Curry led the best offense and team in the game..  Dray at that point was still a role player, became a star next season. Iggy is a 1 time All Star 4 seasons prior and a bench player (albeit 6moty territory) Livingston was a 7th man... Dwight still played half the season but just because Harden has a worse team isn't a reason for him to win MVP lol    https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/apr/09/why-stephen-curry-not-james-harden-is-this-years-nba-mvp"
"&gt; The Mavs before the lockdown literally had the most efficient offense since 1973, beating even the 73 win warriors  And the Dallas Cowboys have the most efficient offense even beating out the greatest show on Turf Rams. Offenses have gotten better and better every year in both sports. 5-10 years from now I bet the Mavs offense this year will probably be beaten several times over.  &gt;20 year old Kobe averaged 26.8% from 3 and hovered around 30-33% for his first 4-5 years.  And he had 1.7 attempts per year that year and it wasn't a big part of his game. 3 point ball just wasn't shot as much then as it is now. Also for referece, Kobe had a much better FT% average than Luka.  &gt;LeBron's career is 73%. So while you can't say he is an elite level level free throw shooter yet, you sure can't say he is a bad shooter.  And he has none of the athleticism that Lebron has. Lebron has never had a team that was ranked as a top 10 offense without him on the court and had the most 3 pointers made in the entire league as far as I know.   &gt;Lastly, Kobe's career ts% is 55% while Luka's is 56.4%. So anyway you look at it, Luka is at least as good a shooter as Kobe and LeBron where at his age  Lebron and Kobe shooting were never great. If I compare Devin Booker to Kobe the elephant in the room would be defense. If someone compares someone to Stephen Curry and Steve Nash and starts talking about their defense it is similar to what you did with comparing Luka to Kobe and Lebron. Luka's biggest strength is supposed to be his TS% and if you compare him to other guards who have elite TS% like Curry and Lillard he isn't there and I don't think he will ever be.   &gt; All while coming from a league where the 3pt line is closer to the hoop   Dude literally everyone comes from a league the 3 point line is closer to the hoop. Whether it be Euroleague, College, or High School. You other points I don't agree with them whatever but this one is just really bad man."

"Stephen Curry, famous Net"
"Based on the dumb criteria for what is considered a player on a team, might as well stretch that a little further and make it Timberwolves - Stephen Curry."
"Stats don't tell the whole story. Stephen Curry is a more efficient basketball player than Kobe Bryant, it doesn't mean that he is better.  Efficiency, while very good, isn't the only thing that matters, especially when you ignore the context of the NBA in the early-2000s which was WAY different than it is today.  James Harden is a more efficient scorer than Michael Jordan per advanced metrics, but nobody thinks he is better. We understand how different eras/context affects efficiency, atleast we do for most players, but gloss over when talking about guys like AI and Kobe."

"Thats just two strawman arguments to be honest. I'm completely aware of how body dismorphia works. Shes married to Stephen Curry. The guy can have anything he wants in the world, but he wants a family with you above all else. I just feel like Ayesha could go somewhere other than Twitter to figure it the fuck out."
2016 Stephen Curry
"Ayesha is an easy target because she goes beyond not wanting to just be ""Mrs. Stephen Curry"" to actually believing and trying to make him ""Mr. Ayesha Curry"".  He is the famous one and she has the opportunity to benefit greatly from that, but she does some things that could jeopardize the whole thing and it's ridiculous.  She's not going to be Gabrielle Union kind of famous because Gabrielle Union, for many people, was, is and forever will be, famous outside of her marriage to Dwyane.

There’s no possible way Stephen Curry is “way better” than James Harden on defense lol.
True but not literally every team in the league has Stephen Curry
"Yes i'm sure free agents are dying to play with a soon to be 33 year old Stephen Curry who was great in his few games this year, a rejuvenated more polished Klay Thompson coming off an ACL tear, and a near finals MVP in 2016 in Draymond Green who showed just how valuable he was in the games this season he played. Not to mention the fact they have high school standout Andrew Wiggins. Man free agents are definitely gonna be interested in playing with that star studded cast guys like ibake, oubre, crowder etc... would definitely take the veteran minimum to play for that squad."

"It's not mythical status, watch the games.  If you actually believe that at any point of his life Steph was better than Kobe, you are spending more time looking at a stat sheet instead of watching people play the game.  There's not a soul on earth that would pick Steph over Kobe Bryant in their peaks. I've watched Steph blow a 3-1 lead with a stacked squad against the Cavs. I've watched Steph have one of the greatest OFFENSIVE regular seasons i've ever seen and then stink up in the Finals and be down 3-1 in the WCF.  If you ask Stephen Curry not even himself believes he was at any point better than Kobe. Steph can't stop a cold on defense and regardless of what you believe of Kobe's help defense later on his career, you can't deny that to the very end he was one of the best 1 on 1 defenders in the game.  Like i said, if you actually believe Steph even compares to Kobe, you are looking to much at a stat sheet instead of actually watching the players play."
"50 game playoff scoring peaks for current superstars  Kevin Durant '16-'19 (66 games): 38.1 points/100, +7.0 rTS  James Harden '15-'19 (61 games): 37.4 points/100, +3.5 rTS  Stephen Curry '15-17 (56 games): 37.1 points/100, +8.5 rTS  Kawhi '15-'19 (53 games): 37.1 points/100, +7.0 rTS  If you do just the most recent sample for Curry, he's at around 36 pts/100 on +7 rTS%.  So even if you wanna disqualify Curry and Durant for how good their team situation is, Kawhi just blows him out of the water  Edit: oh I forgot Lebron too, who completely crushes him"
"&gt; Let’s be real, Kobe won defensive first team and all his other defensive first team selections from that point purely off of reputation.  That's your opinion, the facts are that he made All-Defensive 12 times, 9 of which were First Team. The facts are that most that played against him consider him one of the best perimeter defenders of his generation.  &gt; Kobe did not get robbed in the second.  Kobe led Nash in points, rebounds, steals, blocks, PER, OWS, DWS, WS/48, OBPM, DPBM, BPM and VORP while being First Team All-Defense. Kobe also played with straight garbage like Smush Parker, Kwame Brown and Chris Mihm while in Nash's OWN TEAM, Shawn Marion led that squad in every statistical category and was All-NBA Third Team.  &gt; Kobe definitely wasn’t the best player that year overall, but he did have a great regular season (was very poor in the playoffs, especially for his standards).  First, it's a regular season award. Secondly, Kobe was universally recognized at this point as the best player in the world and had the best season, he was at his absolute peak in this season and only didn't win because of a bullshit narrative.  &gt; 1 MVP seems about right for Kobe considering his peak was never as high as other all time great players  Yeah, it certainly is about right that Kobe Bryant, one of the 10 greatest players to ever play the game and the 2nd greatest SG ever, a player that defined the 2000s and the closest image we've seen of Michael Jordan only has 1 MVP, which puts him behind of guys like Steve Nash, Stephen Curry and Karl Malone (all of whom are ranked lower than him and were far inferior players)."

"cherrypicking stats from very specific runs in his career is such a stupid way of bolstering your argument.  There is 0 argument for jordan to be a top 10 SHOOTER of all time. This is absurd that i even have to make this point.

He is a better player than all of these guys, he is a better tough shot maker than any of these guys, but he is not a better shooter than any one of them.

"Lowry will never accomplish anything ever again in the playoffs. If he does, it won’t be because of him.    Kawhi carries him to one ring and Canadians act like Lowry is Bill Russell. (If I had a dollar for everytime people said Lowry was better than another point guard because Lowry is a “winner” I’d be a very rich man).    Before kawhi showed up, Lowry was like the god of playoff choking. If there was a CPOY (choker player of the year), he’d be a 5x winner. He’d have the all time record on that one.   He doesn’t have eleven rings. He was carried to one by Kawhi. He’s a middling point guard. He’s Mike Conley with a squad behind him. He is not as good as Kyrie Irving no matter how much you force the topic. He isn’t CP3. He looks like a lemur next to Stephen Curry."

https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17455939/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-watches-game-7-motivation  Not an excuse. It’s reality. An excuse would be him saying they lost because of injury. He doesn’t do that.
Stephen Curry skill in shooting helps to make his finishing that much more efficient though. Irving's not the shooter Curry is so defenses are objectively looking for him to drive. Let's not disregard court spacing in this argument as well. I do not care about how fancy his finishes are but one most note that his finishes are that fancy out of necessity not because he likes doing them that way. Which points to his skill in that department.
With Stephen Curry as the Clippers starting point guard and Zion Williamson as the Lakers starting power forward.
"Man, I just hoped more black man acted like they know they have a platform and be an example. Like Lebron, like Curry..   I just saying, he could have a much stronger voice.. but hey, if you compare this guy (who may say the right things at the moment) with Malcolm X?!!! Then you really don’t understand a shit. He only reason Stephen Jackson is talking right now, because it is his friend, his ‘twin’. You know what happened if it was a random black man? Stephen would be smoking weed somewhere and make a woman pregnant."
Everyone on ESPN is seriously pro Lebron except Stephen A who secretely likes Steph Curry more than anyone but wont admit it and Max( pro Kawhi). Everyone else supports Lebron

Michael in only ELEVEN complete seasons with the Bulls:  -10 STRAIGHT scoring titles, -Won Defensive Player of the Year,  -9 times all defensive team,  -9time All NBA,  -5 league MVPs -6 finals MVPs   LBJ missed the playoffs completely in his first 2 years. Jordan didnt with scrubs on his squad. Jordan played 82 games 9 times in his career once at 40. LBJ only played 82 games once. In 89 Jordan won the scoring title all star MVP slam dunk title regular season MVP and Defensive Player of The year something LBJ has never done. Jordan also averaged 41 pts a game for an entire Finals shootimg 50% and won. Something else LBJ never did. All 11 seasons. Mj has done in 11 seasons things Lebron hasn’t done and won’t do in his whole career...      -Going strictly by seeding, Jordan was never upset in the playoffs. Against teams seeded the same or lower, Jordan's teams had a perfect 24-0 series record.  -the 11 seasons he played at least 20 games with the Chicago Bulls, Jordan finished in the top five of MVP voting 10 times. The exception? His rookie season when he finished sixth.  -Over an 11-game stretch in the spring of 1989, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles. Not once over the other 1,061 games of his career did he record back-to-back triple-doubles.  -Jordan was named first-team All-Defense nine times. That's tied with Gary Payton, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett for the most in NBA history.  -Jordan played in 35 NBA Finals games. He was his team's outright leading scorer in 32 of them, with Scottie Pippen (twice) and Toni Kukoc (once) the only others to lead the Bulls in scoring.  -In the 1993 NBA Finals, Jordan scored 38.4 percent of the Bulls' total points. That's the largest percentage of team points any player has been responsible for in a single NBA Finals.  -Jordan is the only player to lead the NBA in both points per game and steals per game in the same season three separate times. Allen Iverson (twice) and Stephen Curry are the only other players to do it even once since steals became official statistics in the 1973-74 season.  -By the end of his tenure with the Bulls, Jordan had developed into the game's best midrange scorer. His final two seasons in Chicago, Jordan made 997 midrange shots, over 250 more than any other player.  -Jordan averaged 11.4 assists per game in the 1991 NBA Finals and led the Bulls outright in assists in all five games. The only player to win Finals MVP while averaging more assists poo game is Magic Johnson in 1987.  -On Nov. 6, 1990, Jordan had 33 points and 12 assists in a two-point loss to Larry Bird's Celtics. It was the Bulls' third straight loss. It was also the last time that Jordan lost three straight games in a single season as a member of the Bulls. He played exactly 500 more regular-season games with Chicago.  -Jordan's title teams did not blow leads. In the six seasons they won the title, they were 42-0 in the playoffs and 210-5 in the regular season when leading by 10 or more entering the fourth quarter."
"Random thought for the nba + anime fans here  If NBA legends were Hokages (Naruto). If you've never seen Naruto you won't get this.  1st Hokage Michael Jordan. GOAT. He was the first legend, unmatched skill and mentality of his time. Created his own brand and is known as the best basketball player ever.  2nd Hokage Kobe Bryant. Some could say he was the younger brother of MJ. He had unmatched skill and mentality, similar to his brother, but with a bit more splashing (3's and water nature type reference). Creator of the Mamba mentality technique, is used by many top players today. He was also the mentor to the 3rd Hokage. Kobe however (like the real 2nd Hokage) died young.  3rd Hokage. Lebron James. Very skilled, fast, athletic, strong, and old. Has been one of the best players for many years. Skilled at all techniques of modern game. Has trained and played with some of the greats of before.  4th/7th Hokage Stephen Curry. Changed the game. He uses techniques from the 2nd Hokage (Kobe) but brings it to a different level. Has a quick release (no hands seals needed) on his technique. Was schooled by the 3rd Hokage early in his career but eventually got to his level.  That's all I got, i'm bored, hope you enjoyed that."
He’s way higher than people give him credit for. It’s important to remember very few good PGs have led their team to a ring as the main option so rings aren’t as essential to the conversation as they would be for another position.   1. Magic Johnson   2. Oscar Robertson   3. Stephen Curry   4. Isiah Thomas   5. Jason Kidd  6. Russell Westbrook   7. Chris Paul  8. Bob Cousy   9. Steve Nash  10. John Stockton
Isiah Thomas  Stephen Curry  Chris Paul  John Stockton  Oscar Robertson  Magic Johnson  and the after that it’s a tossup between Steve Nash and Jason Kidd for me.
&gt; +16.8 on/off that year for lebron  Stephen Curry had an on-off of +17.7 on off across the 5 years the Warriors made the finals

LeBron is easy 1st, with Curry and KD being tough to decide between, but had to go with Curry due to the two MVPs, one being the only ever unanimous MVP. *(Honourables: James Harden)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Playoff MVP of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|FMVPs|Titles|Series W's|Total Pts| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|LeBron James|3|3|28|5,150| |2nd|Kevin Durant|2|2|21|4,043| |3rd|Stephen Curry|-|3|19|2,968|  &amp;nbsp;  - LeBron is obvious 1st again. Durant's longevity and production in the post-season nets him 2nd. FMVPs are good indicators, but only tell a smart part to a post season story, and therefore Steph is comfortably 3rd in my book. *(Honourables: Kawhi Leonard)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Rookie Season of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|ROY|PPG|RPG|APG| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Luka Dončić|2018-19|21.2|7.8|6.0| |2nd|Ben Simmons|2017-18|15.8|8.1|8.2| |3rd|Damian Lillard|2012-13|19.0|3.1|6.5|  &amp;nbsp;  - Comparing all rookie seasons over the course of a decade, Luka would be my favourite for 1st, edging out Simmons. Dame's rookie campaign may have been forgotten, but if you win ROY unanimously over a player like AD, you did something special. *(Honourables: Donovan Mitchell, Karl-Anthony Towns)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Defensive Player of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|DPOYs|DRtg|DWS|DBPM| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Kawhi Leonard|2|100|28.1|+2.4| |2nd|Draymond Green|1|102|27.7|+2.8| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|2|100|24.2|+2.3|  &amp;nbsp;  - In an era of ever-growing perimeter threats, Kawhi has established himself as a defensive juggernaut with his length, strength and oven size mitts. Draymond and Rudy are obvious 2nd and 3rd picks. *(Honourables: Dwight Howard)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Most Improved Player of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|MIP|Draft Pick|Current Status|Change in Points per 36| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|2016-17|15th|MVP Tier|24.5| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|-|15th|MVP Tier|18.1| |3rd|Jimmy Butler|2014-15|30th|Perenial All-Star|12.4|  &amp;nbsp;  - This is improvement over the course of a decade, as opposed to a singular season. So many options to choose from for this award, but Giannis &amp; Kawhi has to be 1 &amp; 2. Both drafted outside the lottery from lesser known programs, both began with a mix of bench and starter minutes, and both ultimately turned into titans of the game. Butler's ascension has also been remarkable, and I'm comfortable to have him at 3rd. *(Honourables: Stephen Curry, James Harden)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Sixth Man of the Decade**  ||Name|6MOYs|PPG|RPG|APG| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Lou Williams|3|16.1|2.4|3.6| |2nd|Jamal Crawford|3|14.2|1.8|2.8| |3rd|James Harden|1|12.7|3.4|2.5|  &amp;nbsp;  - Lou beats out Jamal here just because of Jamal's reduced production in his last two seasons, otherwise it would be impossible to determine. 3rd was also tough to pick, but I had to go with the bench star of those baby Thunder teams. Stats only used for years where they qualified for 6MOY. *(Honourables: Eric Gordon)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Coach of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|COYs|Titles|Record|Win%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Greg Popovich|2|1|559-245|69.5%| |2nd|Steve Kerr|1|3|322-88|78.5%| |3rd|Erik Spoelstra|-|2|480-324|59.7%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Top 2 was hard to decide, but gave it to Pop for the longevity of success. The Heat’s consistency and ability to re-stabilise after the success of the Big 3 Heat helps him place 3rd. *(Honourables: Mike Budenholser, Brad Stevens)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Scorer of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|Scoring Titles|Total Pts|PPG|TS%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Kevin Durant|4|19,445|28.0|62.6%| |2nd|James Harden|2|18,627|24.3|60.9%| |3rd|LeBron James|-|19,550|26.9|60.9%|  &amp;nbsp;  - KD's insane scoring production, consistency and efficiency makes it easy to select him as the top scorer of the decade. Harden is without a doubt second, as he almost makes it boring to talk about his 40+ point games now. Fun fact if we only counted his years on the Rockets, he'd be averaging 29.0 PPG, only behind the career averages of Jordan &amp; Wilt. And LeBron isn't considered a scorer first, but its insane to think he's totalled more points than KD, due in large part to durability and volume consistency. *(Honourables: Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Shooter of the Decade**  ||Name|3PM|3P%|FG%|FT%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Stephen Curry|2,483|43.6%|47.7%|90.5%| |2nd|Klay Thompson|1,798|41.9%|45.9%|84.8%| |3rd|Kyle Korver|1,514|44.5%|45.5%|87.0%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Best shooter of the decade, best shooter in history, same thing for Stephen Curry. His running mate Klay comes in 2nd due to the countless times of historical shooting nights that make you question if you've ever seen him miss before. And Kyle Korver doesn't get talked about much these days, but he is consistently one of the most efficient 3 point shooters ever, he comes in 3rd. *(Honourables: Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Franchise of the Decade**  ||Team|Titles|Series W's|Record|Win%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Golden State Warriors|3|19|505-299|62.8%| |2nd|Miami Heat|2|15|480-324|59.7%| |3rd|San Antonio Spurs|1|13|559-245|69.5%| |4th|Cleveland Cavaliers|1|14|388-416|48.3%| |5th|Toronto Raptors|1|8|440-364|54.7%| |6th|Dallas Mavericks|1|4|420-384|52.2%| |7th|Los Angeles Lakers|1|6|363-441|45.1%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Champions write history, so I included all of them.  &amp;nbsp;  **Non-Champion Franchise of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Team|Furthest Round|Series W's|Record|Win%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Oklahoma City Thunder|Finals|10|515-289|64.1%| |2nd|Boston Celtics|Finals|10|456-347|56.8%| |3rd|Houston Rockets|Conference Finals|6|488-316|60.7%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Showing some love to non-champions and their valiant efforts, not to be forgotten. *(Honourables: LA Clippers, Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies)*  &amp;nbsp;  Any awards I could add?

"this was such fucking bullshit, harden made at least 2 threes during this stretch that kept getting waved off, because the refs don't like it when stephen curry loses"
Stephen Curry has to be higher than 20.  The greatest shooter of all time with unlimited cartoonish range has to be in the top ten.
"This such a lie man. Durant creates a lot of space for Curry &amp; Klay to operate offball &amp; get open shots off screens. Durant has incredible Gravity as a shooter &amp; post player.    Last three NBA Finals.  Stephen Curry with Kevin Durant ON: 72-for-156 (46.2%) from the field, 35-for-83 (42.2%) from three, 57.4 eFG%  Stephen Curry with Kevin Durant OFF: 58-for-155 (37.4%) from the field, 29-for-86 (33.7%) from three, 46.8 eFG%  Even look at the Toronto series, game 5 when KD was subbed in, Steph went for a quick 14 points in the first quarter. That was mainly due to KD’s gravity"
"I can remember watching games clearly back to about the 95-96 season. I am basing this post based solely on seasons I actually saw. This is ranked in order.  1. Shaq - Honestly this isn't even close, nobody has been remotely as dominant as Shaq was during his peak years. Nobody else seemed to have teams change their entire rosters to attempt (and miserably fail) to stop him. Nobody was double and triple teamed as much as Shaq was since I've been watching the NBA yet he still dominated. I feel like he has somehow become the most underrated NBA player in modern history as people are somehow ranking Kobe above him sometimes. 2. Michael Jordan - Remember I only watched the second three-peat. I would take Shaq over that period of MJ. I would probably feel different if I saw the crazy athletic Jordan of the late 80s and early 90s. 3. LeBron - Pretty self-explanatory I think. 4. Stephen Curry 5. Kevin Garnett - Ranking him above Duncan is probably controversial but I honestly think he had a better peak but was stuck on worse teams most of his career and especially all through his peak. 6. Tim Duncan - I feel like I am underrating him here but I am rating on peak here, not longevity. 7. Kobe Bryant - I might be underrating him here but I was more impressed with everyone above him. 8. James Harden 9. Kevin Durant 10. Giannis - He will definitely climb this list.  Chris Paul, Wade, Dirk, and Westbrook were toughest cuts."
"Minnesota was league average in opponents 3 point attempts and percentage (18th in both) in 17-18.   Even in the Bulls days there was an emphasis on running good three point shooters off the line.   People acting like his defense is built to allow Stephen Curry to line up wide open threes, when it’s more he doesn’t care if the Joel Embiid or Rajon Rondos of the world jack up threes."
"Thanks for the level headed discussion. To me, Jordan was a ""better scorer"" only because he didn't involve the team as much as LeBron. LeBron's facilitation goes beyond assists, it's the 3 step ahead, 200 iq plays.  I don't believe the often cited defensive weakness is a real knock against him. Many of the examples people give are bad but they are isolated examples.  I don't think championships matter when you consider the caliber of teams each was playing against. LeBron repeatedly battled the single greatest team in the history of basketball. Jordan battled... James worthy? Clyde Drexler? Sean Kemp? Not that these guys weren't good, but they aren't Stephen curry. And you can point out Barkley and Malone for the Jazz, but those teams weren't as deep as the 2016 warriors, for example."

"While i agree with Perkins that Harden is the more dominant player between he and Curry. I dont like the fact that a guy like perkins who cant pronounce single sentences has a job on a major network like ESPN let alone discussing sports. ESPN is playing a dangerous game with their fans with how they market darker hued african americans on their network. Paul Pierce, Perkins and the ""angry loud black man"" SAS reinfornce negative stereotypes placed on heterosexual black men of darker hue. I like Jay Williams as a hire( very intelligent and knows his stuff), Their are many more like him, that are not getting hired by ESPN. ESPN would NEVER hire a white or lightskinned man that was as loud as SAS or as inarticulate as Kendrick Perkins and Paul Pierce. Its also the same thing i see with the Stephen Jackson and Matt barnes podcast. Stephen Jackson is the ""hood"" host using slang while the lightskin matt barnes puts together coherent sentences and can articulate much better. Harrison Barnes would be perfect for one of these podcast shows"
"The Dream Team selection wasn't quite as straight-forward as ""Who performed the best in the NBA in 1990-91?"" That was true in the case of some selections but there was also ""body of work"" element, where you ended up with someone like Larry Bird getting the call, Magic retaining his spot even after retiring and not playing the 1991-92 season, and where Isiah Thomas would have fit as well had he not burned his bridges. In terms of active players at the time, there weren't too many guys out there who'd done or accomplished more than Isiah Thomas.   This isn't an exact 1:1 comparison, but work with me here. Imagine if 2020 was the first-ever all-pro Dream Team, where the committee was looking to create the best, most notable, and most marketable basketball team in history. Imagine if one of the final spots came down to Stephen Curry and Trae Young. There's an argument that Trae's 30 &amp; 10 in 2020 dwarfs anything Curry did this season. But it probably wouldn't take much for a committee to counter with, ""Yeah but Steph's been a face of the NBA for years, he's a non-stop all-star, he's a champion, he's exciting, people know him, yadda, yadda, yadda"".   Again, the analogy isn't perfect because calling John Stockton Trae Young would be an insult to Stockton at this point. However, as it pertains to what Thomas was to the NBA at that point, it holds true. At the time:  * 10-time All-Star (2-time All-Star MVP)  * 5-time All-NBA (Played at an All-NBA level in additional years where similarly performing players earned the honor instead)  * Pushed the 1988 Lakers to seven games in the NBA Finals, including a 43-point performance on a severely sprained ankle.  * Broke his wrist in April of '89 and played through half the postseason with a brace, before recovering to averaged 24 in 8 through most of the '89 Finals. (Pistons win it all.)  * Runs away with Finals MVP honors in 1990, averaging 27, 8, and 5 against Portland. Pistons win second consecutive championship, inches away from three-peating.  * Thomas plays 1991 with a virtually non-functioning shooting hand until he finally submits to surgery in January. Comes back for the playoffs, sprains his foot, still lifts Pistons to victory over Celtics in overtime, then the team falls to rightful champion Chicago.   * Selection show in Sep. '91  When you look at it all together, at that point Isiah Thomas had won two of the previous three NBA championships, was one of two recent Finals MVPs, and was undoubtedly one of the most recognizable names and faces in the game ([shout out to his cameo in the Fresh Prince](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2fV77ixWmA)).  He had 100 percent had a case from a basketball perspective but the Bad Boys stuff got too bitter and he ended up on the wrong side of the wrong guy at that point."
"I've really liked what Simmons is doing with the ringer and all the nostalgic basketball content, doing rewatches of old finals or revisiting redrafts. Ditto for Stephen Jackson and Barnes taking us on a early 2000's nostalgia trip with Vince Carter and Penny Hardaway interviews or talking about the 'we believe' warriors era   Obviously the long form 1 hr+ podcast format doesn't translate 1:1 to 'traditional' ESPN broadcasting, but given how the average sports fan clearly has an appetite for 90's basketball nostalgia I think there's definitely a way to talk about old rivalries and historic league moments beyond Jordan  Hell, even if they do need to make everything a comparison to the modern NBA, at least expand the 'who was better' convo past Lebron.   As long as it gets them showing old highlights and revisiting players and moments, I'd settle for Stephen A yelling about how Hakeem was better than AD, or why Gary Payton would lock up guys like Harden or Curry in a 7 game series"
"Yeah, I find it hard to believe that Seth autocorrects to ‘Setbacks’ and Curry to ‘Currently’ but it is goddamn hilarious. However, that broke the immersion for me because I immediately went to Stephen Curry, and he wasn’t not “Currently”"

"15, 16, and maybe 17 are currys only great seasons. Curry is very overrated by the media and the nba players know this, he misses too many games, his career counting stats are pretty pedestrian.. 16.5 k points, and 4.5 assists by age 32 doesnt scream anything special. But he gets elevated by leftists because he plays in silicon valley the new media hub for sports. The whole talk of curry being hated on because he is lightskin was reverse psycoholgy, and the media knew it. No player is more coddled by the media than stephen curry, every bad game he has their is an injury excuse made for him. When guys like lebron and harden never get those excuses, the same media said durant was happy the warriors were losing without him in the finals last year after curry was getting exposed on defense and accused durant of faking his heel injury. This also coincides with Chris Broussard calling kevin durant a ""luxury"" on fs1( imagine calling a 2x finals mvp a luxury) Durant was guilted into coming back by the media to try and help curry get a meaningless finals mvp. Curry worship coinsides with harden hate. The media does NOT want harden to tie curry in mvps. They will keep robbing him, the only reason they voted for harden in 2018 is because the media didnt wanna give LeBron another one. Westbrook was a 7th seed and won mvp, thats something i can never get an answer from curry stans when they try and tell me curry is hated because he is lightskin. Ask yourself this, if curry had a season where he led the warriors to the 3rd seed averaging 29/8/11, would curry lose mvp to another player who only had 2 more rebounds but didnt even win 50 games. NO curry would probably win another uniamous mvp with a season like that.  Max Kellerman said that curry could average 36 like harden did in 2019, and when curry had his chance with no kd and no klay he shot horrible from the field and got injured smh. When your usage goes up, its much harder to be dominant and score when teams know you are gettin the ball everytime. Harden was dominating and winning games with g leaguers bruh, players that wouldnt even crack the warriors rotation THIS YEAR"
"Yeah, old Tim Duncan and young Kawhi were as good as prime Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, great argument there."
You gotta be talking about Eddie Curry. There’s no way you’ve just implied Stephen curry doesn’t have international fame among people who aren’t into basketball.

"If hardens numbers are inflated by dantoni( which is subjective). then how are stephen currys stats not inflated by STEVE KERR( who is a coaching disciple of dantoni). Thats a bad excuse. Harden finished 2nd and arguably should have won an mvp under kevin mchale in 2015. Dantoni may have inflated hardens numbers, but nothing like what Kerr did for curry."
"Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Stephen Curry"

Stephen Curry is better at basketball than Mahomes is at football.
.... there's this guy called Stephen Curry on the team.
There's a basketball movie from 2012 called Thunderstruck starring Kevin Durant. There's also a movie from 2004 called [Thunderstruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstruck_\(2004_film\)) starring [Stephen Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry_\(comedian\)).
"Stephen Curry has absolutely NOT performed better than Harden in the playoffs since 2017 and individually lost both head to head if you watch games and stats, I think you should go check the stats honestly. Of course Curry’s legacy is way better"
"&gt; KD is an All-nBA level on defense in the playoffs. He’s an elite shot blocker &amp; very good face up defender that covers 4 positions.   I acknowledge that KD is the better defender of the two. I still wouldn't consider him a great defender, although he is definitely better than Curry. He has some shot blocking abilities, but he's not a shot blocking presence like AD, the Lopez twins, etc. so I would definitely not call him an elite shot blocker. It's true that he can guard more positions than Curry, which is why I acknowledged that he's a better defender.  &gt; Why have Durant’s teams been better than Curry’s for the first 6 years of the decade then? Both on offense &amp; Defense? Kds offensive metrics were far better than Curry’s those 6 years....   KD was on a much better team than Curry was during the first half of the decade. That doesn't disprove the point that Curry makes his teammates better than Durant does. I even said in my comment than Durant is a better volume scorer (although on slightly worse efficiency than Curry), if those are the offensive metrics you're referring to.  &gt; Durant is also a better 5v5 player than Curry. He plays 4 positions on offense, Creates for his teammates much better off the dribble, scores better, defends better. KD’s on/off stats have been better than Curry’s as well in the postseason every year.   Playing 4 positions on offense doesn't mean he's a better 5v5 player. Nobody would argue against Shaq being great because he only played as a center. How does KD create much better for his teammates off the dribble? Curry is a better passer and since he's a primary ball handler, while Durant has had Westbrook or Curry alongside him, he has higher assist numbers. This is all without taking into account opportunities Curry creates for his teammates because of his off ball gravity (i.e. if Curry is setting a screen or running around a screen, both his defender and the defender of the other person involved in the screen both focus on Curry).    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL9HZkC34Gg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL9HZkC34Gg)   Here's a very quick example of that happening. During the series between the Warriors and Thunder in the 2015-16 playoffs, Durant had more turnovers than assists because the defense was able to focus on him and he wasn't great at finding his open teammates. During the finals between the Warriors and Cavs when the Warriors had Durant, the Cavs prioritized guarding Curry over Durant because Curry is a better decision maker, even if Durant is a better pure scorer.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuP6-puSfRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuP6-puSfRs)   That video gives a lot more detail on how Curry helps Durant get even better because of his off ball gravity.  Again, I do acknowledge that Durant is a better volume scorer and a better defender.  &gt; I just don’t understand minimizing Durant for being elite 1v1 when that’s the most important aspect of the game. 70% of basketball is played in isolation....Durant being arguably the GOAT at that world in his favor.   I'm not minimizing Durant for being elite 1v1. He's ranked so highly in large part because of how elite he is 1v1.   I won't agree that 70% of basketball is played in isolation. That completely depends on your team and playstyle. The Warriors have an extremely movement heavy offense with players that carry off ball gravity (Curry and Klay) and an elite playmaker (Draymond). They have constant motion with plenty of varieties of screens, pin downs, flares, etc. that open up good looks from three or passing and driving lanes. This kind of offense is so great because of Curry's off ball gravity.  I will even agree that Durant is near GOAT level as a pure isolation scorer. The only players that even come close to his levels of scoring and efficiency are Adrian Dantley, Stephen Curry, Karl Malone, Kareem, Jordan, LeBron, Shaq, and few others. But I actually think Durant might be the GOAT isolation scorer, but that's still not enough in my opinions to outweigh the opportunities Curry creates for his teammates both on ball, but especially off ball.  &gt;I just don’t see an argument for Curry ahead of KD in terms of 3-5 year peak of longevity.   I'm not sure what you'd consider their 3 and 5 year peaks, but for reference just looking at scoring, Curry's 3 year scoring peak is from 2015-16 to 2017-18 and he averaged 39.6 PTS/100 possessions on 65.4% TS. Durant's 3 year scoring peak is from 2013-14 to 2015-16 and he averaged 40.1 PTS/100 possessions on 63.4% TS. Both of them are elite and I don't think you can really give a scoring edge to either based on 3 year peak.   In terms of 5 year scoring peaks, Curry from 2015-16 to 2019-20 averaged 39.2 PTS/100 on 64.9% TS and Durant from 2011-12 to 2015-16 averaged 39.0 PTS/100 on 63.2% TS.  This is all without acknowledging Steph being the better playmaker (but this also doesn't acknowledge the fact that Durant is a better defender).  &gt; Did you know Stephs TS drops from 65 TS to 60 TS with Curry off the floor?   I'm not sure what this means."

"First scenario: Wilt Chamberlain - pickup would allow him to be even more physical and he's the most physically dominating player ever  Second scenario: Stephen Curry - if I don't take him, someone else will and he can work as either a ball dominant player, or alongside another playmaker and he's the best off-ball player ever so he'd scale really well with whoever else I take in the draft."

"NBA's YouTube channel used to post them. But nowadays I only find some on the team's YouTube channel.   Phantom cams are the slow Mo version of highlights. Most mixes use the normal topside view with a combination of these.   For Normal topside, you need to go to the games of the players via NBA League pass and watch em and record them.   Easier way is watching ESPN clips about the player. You'll find those angles you need when the hosts talk about the player. If the players are stars, then ESPN has playlists of all the things they talk about the player. Like ""LeBron James on ESPN"" or ""Stephen Curry on ESPN""."
"alright well in the interest of saving us both time i’ll give my list of top point guards, and i think that if someone has close to or even more than 10 players better and more accomplished than them **at their own position,** it should be ridiculous to rank them top 30 among all positions, so here we go...  1. magic johnson 2. isiah thomas 3. oscar robertson 4. stephen curry 5. steve nash 6. chris paul 7. jason kidd 8. gary payton 9. chauncey billups 10. john stockton (and i only rank him this high because of **career longevity** even though many of the players after him were **vastly superior** during their peak years) 11. walt frazier 12. russell westbrook 13. damian lillard 14. bob cousy can come after all those guys (he’s also overrated, but not nearly as egregiously as stockton is)  you know who’s actually underrated? karl (shit person, great player) malone. you wouldn’t even know stockton’s name if he didn’t have karl (2nd leading scorer of all time) malone and an archaic system built around a single main point guard dominating ALL assists for the team for 19 ENTIRE SEASONS where neither of them EVER missed time. john stockton was a really good player, but he SUCKS compared to the player people perceive him as.  stockton would be almost a NOBODY in today’s game, unless you gave him giannis or AD and a coach that insisted on the default offensive set running exclusively through stockton/giannis or AD pick n rolls for 19 FKN SEASONS (with stockton getting literally more than 80% of team assists like he did with the jazz many years).  meanwhile, all those other PGs on my list from past eras would be stars in their own right today. stockton however would not be, no way. easily the least impressive supposed “all-time great” ever."
"Stephen Curry - Reggie Miller - LeBron James - Larry Bird - Hakeem Olajuwon  I know Reggie will get the most questions and ofc I don't think he's better than Jordan or Kobe, but I don't need a bunch of ball dominant guys. Reggie and Curry are both great off ball (Bird is too, but not on their level). So this team would have a ton of player movement with LeBron being able to create his own shot, create shots for Curry/Reggie/Bird with his amazing playmaking, plus Hakeem is a great defender who can also get his own shot with the ball."
"I haven't seen one. However this tidbit is interesting:  &amp;#x200B;  When I released the paperback edition of *The Book of Basketball* in 2009, I ranked Scottie Pippen 24th all time as a Level Four Hall of Fame Pyramid guy. On my 2020 list, he’s been passed by four players—Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Dirk Nowitzki and Kevin Durant—landing him at 28th. Here’s what I wrote about Scottie in my book."

"KD could score 40 every game if he chose to.  AI is one of my 3 favorite players ever but he shot volume to get his points while KD is one of the most efficient players ever.  If he sacrificed some of that efficiency there’s no question he could do what you’re talking about other players doing.  The only player who scores more efficiently is Stephen Curry, and warriors homer though I am, I cannot tell you that Steph is capable of scoring the volume KD does.  He scored 32 a game with .635 true shooting.  I love AI but he’s never come close to that and his career average true shooting is very nearly 10% lower.  AI has to score 30+ even on dog shit efficiency because his teammates couldn’t score.  KD has Russ and Harden, then just Russ, then Steph and Klay.  Like I said earlier.  If you needed KD to drop to 55% true shooting and score you 40, he could average it no problem."
"If you told people that a team with Lebron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh lost, they would think you are crazy.

So, yes there is no such thing as a guaranteed ring."

"Duncan Robinson is great at defense. I’ve watched most Miami games this year, and he reminds me of 2015 Stephen Curry. He’s not flashy on defense and isn’t going to “lockdown” people, but he’s always in the right spots, makes the right rotations, takes directions from his teammates, funnels guys into the help, contests shots, and stats between his man and the basket."

Highly doubt he actually has a legit 41 inch vertical when he never gets his head anywhere close to the rim in game. Vertical numbers a lot of the time are bs and can be gamed. Do you really think Steven Adams can jump higher than DeAndre Jordan? Or Kevin Love jumping higher than Andre Drummond? Stephen Curry is one inch off from jumping as high as Westbrook? Luke Babbit can jump as high as Larry Nance? Because that's what the vertical measurements will tell you.

"It's worse when you look at who they could have taken.  2009: Stephen Curry went 3 picks after Tyreke Evans.  2011: They originally had the 7th pick (Bismack Biyombo), while Kemba Walker went 9th. They traded the 7th pick for the 10th pick (Jimmer Fredette), while Klay Thompson went 11th.   2012: Damian Lillard went 1 pick after Thomas Robinson  2018: Luka Doncic went 1 pick after Marvin Bagley III  So if you look at that, there was the possibility where the Kings could have had Stephen Curry in 2009 and Klay Thompson in 2011, with DeMarcus Cousins between then in 2010."

This makes for some tough cuts—Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Victor Oladipo, Klay Thompson, etc.—but this is, in essence, a 2019-20 retrospective. Sample size has to matter.  Are you illiterate?"
Bro lol when the other team knows you’re the only option and you’re getting doubled left and right and being guarded/doubled by the best defender in the league barring none and you **still** put up 47 you gotta give some more credit than you are.   And after reading the second half of your comment you just have proven you just don’t know very much about basketball. If you think curry can’t score in iso then idk what to tell you. Watch him play more maybe ? Yoire calling Stephen curry a cone lmao lemme ask you something: what do you think the main differences between a player like curry and a player like Klay are
"&gt; I think people are underrating the possibility that a lot of people don’t care that much about Stephen Jackson’s opinion.  He’s no longer in the league and outside of his podcast has recently only been relevant because of his proximity to George Floyd  I think you're underestimating the influence that his podcast has among NBA players.  Just since December, he's had Dwayne Wade, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett, Demarcus Cousins, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Steve Nash, Jayson Tatum, Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, Bradley Beal and more on his show.  Many of them came in person and most stayed more than an hour.    Jackson and Barnes might not be household names among casual fans, but they're clearly inner circle NBA guys.  This isn't some fringe ex-player shooting his mouth off, this is a guy who the NBA's legends and young stars were lining up to be seen with."
What if Minnesota hadn’t passed on Stephen Curry twice in the 2009 Draft?
why on earth should he?  Stephen jackson is a nobody. should Silver condemn every ex-player who says something offensive?   If it was Lebron/Curry/Jordan saying this shit then it's a topic for everyone to discuss.
"""highest paid athletes""  How can you make such a strong assumption about such a small, niche group of individuals with incredibly low sample size? My point is it's likely that we don't know fuck all about what goes on in their private jets.   Also, why'd you change the question of him ""gambling"" 10,000 dollars to him ""spending"" 10,000 dollars. How does that not change the conversation completely, especially when talking about Stephen Curry, an individual known to be one of the most wholesome, family-valued sports superstars literally ever."
You telling me that Kerr doesn't use the advantage of Stephen Curry's range in his offense ? I could have sworn Kerr himself has said Curry was the engine of the team. What's idiotic is thinking that Curry's spot up range is a symptom of Kerr's coaching.

"Steph [actually](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/02/12/forbes-highest-paid-nba-players-list-lebron-james-stephen-curry) makes twice that, $80,000,000 per year counting endorsements. So as a percentage it's equivalent to $175 from the $40,000 person. But of course it's not equivalent -- as you said, you were oversimplifying. To oversimplify a tiny bit less, the $175 means a lot more to someone making $40,000 because of diminishing returns. For someone scraping by, it might be the difference between making a rent payment or paying for a prescription. A person making $40,000 probably saves little, if any money year to year.   On the other hand, Steph covered his necessities, and secured himself a life of unimaginable luxury, about $79 million ago. He's also able to build ungodly amounts of wealth over time. What would $350,000 less mean to him? A smaller 5th yacht?  I understand he's not obligated to donate huge sums to every cause that comes along -- even someone that rich can't solve all the world's problems, and I do think he's entitled to enjoy some of his money. But it is weird to me how these kinds of threads always have a bunch of comments defending the right of the ultra-rich to hoard their money."
"Stephen Curry is going to retire at like 43 and then immediately transition to winning golf championships until his early 50s. Every time he goes for a birdie on a Par 4 course, the announcers will go ""Steph Curry for threeeeee..."" or ""Steph from deep!"" if he's chipping."

"how many players do you think are superstars  &gt;You don't put up the numbers and explosive performances he has had without being a special talent.  sure, he's a special talent.  he's not a superstar.  also, your language here REALLY shows your bias. look at this:  &gt;He's probably not a lead your team as the number one guy star  no, he definitely isn't.  &gt;I think the difference is **maybe** Klay isn't as likely as a Damian Lillard to get his team into the playoffs as the #1.  no, he definitely isn't as likely.  &gt;**Maybe** Damian Lillard can create his shot more than Klay  no, he definitely can.  you use words like ""maybe"" and ""probably"" for obvious statements that are negative towards klay. then you proceed to toss them aside and show 100% certainty for statements positive towards klay:  &gt;But he **dang sure** is going to be a player that is more likely to win a championship with his kind of skillset.  so you're 100% sure, no uncertainty, that klay is more likely to win a championship in a vacuum due to his skillset. but you're uncertain that he's a worse shot creator than damian fucking lillard?   have you ever watched either player play? honest question  &gt;But he dang sure is going to be a player that is more likely to win a championship with his kind of skillset.  if he plays with a lebron james, stephen curry, or kevin durant, right? lol. he ain't doing shit on his own. which is why he isn't a superstar. THOSE players are superstars. not klay."
"Stephen curry, Splash bros"
I think people are sleeping on Ender Wiggins.  He is going to put up 25/5/5 on 45/35/80 splits.  Playing next to Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson will really open up his game under Kerr's system.
Stephen Curry is not the NBA. If the NBA is a hollow and empty product with soleless piggybacking on social justice (similar to the NFL) it's not the fault of a single player within that league
"&gt; 1) so Kobe has either the same or more amount of MVPs and FMVPs as Duncan? i don't see ""less"" in your comment  So Tim Duncan has 11 All NBA First Teams? So Tim Duncan was as crucial to his 5th championship as Kobe was to each of his 5? Tim Duncan has 9 All Defensive First selections? Scoring titles? Your nitpicking 1-2 items and the semantics of the word 'less' is trivial at best. Kobe Bryant outplayed Tim Duncan and the Spurs in multiple times and eliminated them, directly. You can say he 'won' the series MVPs against Tim Duncan in all of those match-ups.  &gt; 2) Okay you don't like PER, what about VORP? what about WS or WS/48? What about Net Rating? Which advanced stat do you like or are they all just BS?  List out every single one that you want. By your metrics, Chris Paul is better than Tim Duncan in every single way. You haven't changed a goddamned thing. And Hakeem Olajuwon is fucking 46th and you're citing that as a valuable metric? I honestly didnt even bother reading the remainder of your post. You're citing bullshit cumulative career statistics, when on a season-by-season basis, you're implying that:  VORP: Chris Paul, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Dwyane Wade, Tracy McGrady, Russell Westbrook, KG, Shaq, Bird, Stockton, David Robinson, and Grant Hill have all put up VASTLY superior seasons than Tim Duncan.  BPM: I guess Giannis's current season is literally the 5th best of all time -- nearly 50% superior than any season Tim Duncan has ever put together?  WS/48 for CAREER: Chris Paul is your 4th best player of all time after Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, and David Robinson? Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and James Harden round out the top 10?  Dude, really, shut the fuck up. Aggregate stats give a ballpark of player value, AT BEST. With Defensive stats, it's SIGNIFICANTLY less reliable.  I'd eat a bowl of shit if you answered correctly how to calculate any of the metrics you're citing in realtime.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Tim Duncan's teams were NOT weak because of ""salary"" you dipshit. You have half this sub saying Kobe is 'selfish for not taking paycuts' to make his team better and yet it's somehow still a plus for Tim Duncan to be on teams with lower salaries? The Big 3 Heat were probably a trash team as well right, because they were able to afford it via salary? All players took salary cuts. It's the most idiotic response out there.  Yes, you wasted your time replying because your reply is stupid."
"I mentioned that advanced stats are skewed towards bigs and take into account team defenses.  Defensive stats are the most egregious for this. You’re comparing the advanced defensive stats of a guard against essentially a center. It is the same reason I ignored that Kobe scores more points on a regular basis. The isolated comparison is not valuable.  I’m going to assume you meant to say he didn’t deserve any all NBA defensive teams, for which you’re objectively wrong, and don’t know what more to tell you. If K  If you need to stick to exclusively those RAPM, DBPM, DWS, etc, to evaluate an individual player’s defense, then really — what more is there to discuss? You and I both know those are flawed metrics. Otherwise, we’d say that most players on most historically decent defensive teams are good defenders. I.e. Stephen Curry on the Warriors. We both know this is not true.  As far as Shaq fading out during those series — were those series Lakers vs. Spurs? Did both Kobe and Tim Duncan play in those series? Did Tim Duncan play on the Pistons? I’m not sure why you find it difficult to understand why those are relevant and other series are not. I brought up the Western Conference in response to another guy who said that while Tim Duncan did not get FMVP one season, he was still “the guy”. I brought up the Spurs series in particular, because Kobe led the way against the Spurs which included prime Tim Duncan, coincidentally one of the greatest rim protectors of all time. A fact that was irrelevant during most of the Kobe-Spurs series out there."
"\&gt; Kobe's peak was longer and as a result his individual statistical accomplishments are greater.  what individual statistical accomplishments does Kobe have other than more points scored?  you say Kobe was dropping 27 a game at age 34...Duncan made all nba first team at age 36  Duncan also has an extra MVP and an extra FMVP..  The only people who have Kobe over Duncan are people who don't realize there's more to the game than ppg.  it's yahoo sports, but here's a rough breakdown of their career  [https://sports.yahoo.com/whose-nba-career-was-better-kobe-bryant-vs-tim-duncan-164812274.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/whose-nba-career-was-better-kobe-bryant-vs-tim-duncan-164812274.html)  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; Duncan averaged 23.3 points, with career highs of 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game. The only other player to produce those numbers in a single season: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who did it six freaking times. (Speaking of which, we should throw him into a “Who was better?” with the GOATs from other eras.)  Those who averaged Kobe’s stat line at his apex: Kareem ... Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Rick Barry, Clyde Drexler, Tracy McGrady, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, James Harden and Russell Westbrook."
"If you were a team captain running pickup and trynna run the courts for say...an hour straight...y’all would seriously take Curry over Harden? Curry hands down has the better NBA career and as great of a shooter Harden is, Curry still manages to be better. That being said James Harden is the best ball handler, a better finisher at the rim, a better playmaker, maybe better IQ but that’s def debatable. Hardens also a better defender and is arguably better at making difficult shots, i.e, he’s better at knocking down the shots where there’s a hand or two in his face and feet underneath his legs. I know it’s not all about statistics but it is a fact that James Harden takes the most difficult shots in the league (bc defenders in the NBA aren’t gonna have it any other way for a guy averaging 30+) and he knocks them down above league average. I’m not saying Harden is so obviously better than Curry or anything, I just think a lot of you are letting Stephen Currys amazing NBA career cloud your judgement. Stephen Curry has had better guys around him during their peaks. Harden is a better individual player than Steph. I know it’s not a question of who’s a better 1 on 1 player but outside of the NBA that’s usually how this question is answered. Who would win 1 on 1? And if your answer is Steph than I don’t even know what to say tbh."

"I know one GM that would rather have Ben over Trae, the Hawks GM. In fact, every single one of them would.  Ben is a Top 20 player in the game without being able to hit a shoot outside of 3 ft, he's literally better at anything you can be at basketball than Trae Young outside of shooting.  But i guess, to yall Hawks fans the dude is the second coming of Stephen Curry so why am i losing my time."

"""genius"" is a stretch. Dude is mad annoying to me personally. I get it's a gimmick but it's just obnoxious. I also don't like giving Stephen A and them any attention but at least I can avoid them. Stephen A stupid hottake? Easy to avoid, just don't open the video/thread/tweet/etc. To each their own, many are entertained by them and that's fine. Flight's annoying ass is different. You can't go on any platform when it's Curry related without being flooded with stupid low effort flight shit."

"Stephen Curry is a playmaker who happens to make a lot of plays while off ball, so let’s not undersell him in that area. Luka does have the size advantage of course. Still, until proven otherwise, Stephen Curry is the ultimate offensive weapon to me, and I’d rather have him than Luka next year. But Steph is also a lot older, and Luka has room to improve, so long term it’s a different story."
"With all due respect to Doncic, Stephen Curry bru.."
Why are you here if you don't watch basketball? The spurs won more than 3 and that was so recent. Stephen Curry never even won an Finals MVP and OKC never won with Durant and Westbrook.  &amp;#x200B;  It is seasonal MVP
"Exactly. Most, including myself, wouldn't have cared at all if LeBron took the same path others have taken, which is not to offer any meaningful comment.  Seems to me most arguments for LeBron make it sound as if LeBron is being criticized for not taking a side, which isn't the case. [That's what others did like Kerr and Curry](https://sports.yahoo.com/stephen-curry-becomes-latest-nba-thought-leader-to-avoid-addressing-china-controversy-232539375.html), and rarely anyone blames them for it."
" &gt;First of all, Westbrook averaged a triple double in the next two seasons and didn't get any consideration whatsoever for MVP (if a guy averaged the most points, rebounds, assists etc. in 50 years they would win the MVP all 3 years).  You're saying two different things there. Yes he didn't get consideration after because, he had already done it and didn't improve upon it.  The second part is describing someone being the league leader in points, rebounds and assists which is different than a triple double and arguably more impressive.   &gt;In the last ten years I would list 2011 Derrick Rose and 2015 Stephen Curry as other examples.  Best players on the best teams in the NBA, with great stats winning the MVP isn't a narrative thing.  It seems like you just don't agree with a few awards, are using to media narrative as an excuse for why the player you preferred didn't win."
"I had to get some stats done.  First of all, Westbrook averaged a triple double in the next two seasons and didn't get any consideration whatsoever for MVP (if a guy averaged the most points, rebounds, assists etc. in 50 years they would win the MVP all 3 years).  In the last ten years I would list 2011 Derrick Rose and 2015 Stephen Curry as other examples.  In 2011 Rose was marketed as the kid from Chicago who was singlehandedly carrying his team, and was given a ton of hype.  As exciting as Rose was leading that offense, it was clear that they were really good because of their top of the league defense.  LeBron had no chance that year because he was unpopular after the decision, and Dwight likely would have been a better choice as well. In 2015 Harden carried the Rockets to the second seed in the West going on a run while Dwight Howard was injured and putting up much better numbers than Curry.  However, Curry had become a cultural phenomenon by that point, and Harden didn't have a chance.  None of the aforementioned votes were remotely close. 2008 Kobe over CP3 is another great example although it is not that recent"
"Which I always found strange, because the only pass-first point guards to win championships as starters since 1990 have been Avery Johnson and Jason Kidd. Everyone else has either been a score-first guy like Tony Parker or Stephen Curry, or hasn’t been the primary ball-handler, like Derek Fisher and Mario Chalmers."
"Stephen Curry. I was a kid back when Curry was in his MVP seasons. I'm a small, skinny kid (5'9 125lbs) and my game revolves around the threat of my 3pt shot."
"PG: Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Russell Westbrook SG: James Harden Jimmy Butler Paul George SF: LeBron James Kawhi Leonard Khris Middleton PF: Anthony Davis Blake Griffin Kevin Love C: Joel Embiid Karl Anthony-Towns Bam Adebayo  Reserves: Chris Paul Bradley Beal DeMar DeRozan Jayson Tatum LaMarcus Aldridge  Any players like Luka and Giannis would play for their country and I didn't put any rookies. Also left out injured players such as KD, Kyrie, and Klay."

"Derrick Rose is younger than Stephen Curry  Bonus fact Curry is only like 4 months younger than Andrew Bynum, who had his rookie season in *2005*"
"&gt; From the videos ive been watching i quite like Stephen Curry, but i checked and his teams won 5 in a row, so that feels a bit glory hunter to support them.   This is what we call a ""bandwagon fan"", basically a fair-weather fan who only supports a team when it's good. In the past few years the term became synonymous with ""Warriors fan"" because they were super stacked, they had 2 MVP caliber players, a DPOY, another All-NBA talent and other good pieces.  Now things are a bit different, Kevin Durant has left the team, Draymond Green has gotten worse and Steph isn't getting any younger. This year they're already out of the playoff race, but maybe next year they'll be better. Still, nobody would call you a bandwagon if you started following the Warriors now.  The best teams at the moment are the Bucks, the Lakers and the Clippers. Then you have the Raptors (defending champions, but their best player from last year left for the Clippers), Celtics, Nuggets, Rockets, Heat and Jazz, also decent. The promising young teams are the Mavericks, the Pelicans, the Celtics and the Sixers (kind of). I think OKC has a bright future as well.   The bad teams are the Kings, Suns, Wizards, Grizzlies, Bulls, Pistons, Hornets, Timberwolves, Hawks, Cavs. Some of these have young talent (Kings, Suns, Hawks) that might develop in the coming years.  The Spurs were bad this year, but they've been one of the most successful franchises in the past 20 years.  The Knicks have been terrible since the 90s, they're hopeless.  The Nets have two superstars who might do some damage next year.  The Rockets are my favorite team but they are a weird, weird team. I don't think they're going to win a championship in the near future, but they're fun to watch.  From what I hear, the Pacers are decent, they had a good player who got injured and we don't know if he's going to make a complete recovery.   If I were you, I'd choose the Mavericks: they have the youngest superstar in the NBA (Luka Doncic) and another good player in Porzingis. They're already decent and exciting to watch, and in a couple of years they might even be title contenders.  I wouldn't choose the Lakers because they're super old and they won't be good in 3-4 years."
"Wardell is actually Currys first name, his full name is Wardell Stephen Curry II"
Wardell Stephen Curry III
Well Stephen is a good enough middle name in its own regard. If his name is like Wardell Eugene Curry he’s fucked
"Agreed! As a 30+yo man with bad knees, i’m constantly amazed at how he can still impact games without having elite athleticism. If only he didn’t get injured and Minny drafted Stephen Curry instead of Johnny Flynn, we’d probably be talking about how beautiful the Rubio-Curry-Love offense is."
*Wardell Stephen Curry ~II~
Wardell Stephen Curry II
"I’ve worked with Stephen Curry before and even though everyone on TV refers to him as Steph, his reps instructed us before meeting him he is to always be called Stephen, not Steph. Sure enough he walks in, very friendly, and introduces himself as Stephen. Also, he’s a lot bigger in person than he appears on TV. I mean I knew he was 6’3”, but he’s quite built too."
"I watch all the teams play.  Draymond Greens impact is very tangible,  his defense, his playmaking on offense.  They are things we can see on film and measure them with advanced metrics.  Him running his mouth has nothing to do with how great a defender he is  Anyways , Stephen Curry is the main piece that makes the Warriors work.  So by definition that's the heart of the team to me.  Draymond is necessary as well,  but they would still have been a very good team without him .  Without Curry they dont even sniff the finals"

"There's only one skyfucker, and his name is ~~Robert Paulson~~ Stephen Curry!"
I saw someone try to argue that Klay Thompson was better than Stephen Curry because he played better defense
"The Crazy part to me is he was doing this in under 3 quarters a game.  Most nights he never saw the 4th quarter or even half of the 3rd quarter because they didn't need him to win... Stephen Curry is by know means the greatest player ever,  but I'm almost 26 and never seen a more exciting athlete (in any sport) to watch. I have also never seen someone change the game the way curry did. He wasn't just flawless at everything like Jordan or Kobe, he really changed the way basketball will forever be played through years of dedication and confidence. (Also a great family man on and off the court)"
The Warriors had Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant? Morey has maximized his assets with a cheap af owner.
All of the shooters for the Mavs becomes Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson with Luka on the bench but when he's playing they become Josh Smith

Think that's what he means by smaller guards anyways. Basically the ones that are average point guard sized and not wing sized.  Kyrie did good with LeBron but wasn't great without him on Boston. Westbrook is known for his efficiency going to shit in the playoffs. Stephen Curry had KD and Klay Thompson being huge threats to play off of.
"Counterpoint:  Monta was never the Warriors best player. In '07 and '08 it was Baron Davis. In '09 it was probably Stephen Jackson or Corey Maggette, not the one-dimensional scorer with a .503TS%. By the end of '10 it was Curry - I guess maybe you could say the first three months of the season, it was Monta.   Monta Ellis was the poster child for how badly players get misevaluated if you only look at how much they score and/or how much fun they are to watch."
I still laugh at that story where Curry started hopping on one foot in front on Jackson's congregation. That dude was way deep into evangelical stuff.   [Here's the story.

Stephen Curry is the most attractive player in the league and it's not close!
"Klay is a better defensive player. Klay is a top 4 shooter ALL TIME. Harden is a better driver and facilitator.  Klay is a 3 time champion, forming the BEST backcourt in the league with Stephen Curry. You’re buggin if you think he isn’t hungry and still the best SG in the league. SOrry, I value rings and championship pedigree.  &amp;#x200B;  Klay holds the more impressive NBA post season record(s), if you don’t think he’s a better shooter"
"&gt;You’re all insults and self created narratives. No substance to what you say and I know why.

Here's the evidence you asked for.  **The ceiling for him to be better is there, but currently, he is not better than these players. The literal statistics prove that you are wrong. Now shut the fuck up you actual idiot. If you sit here and actually try to argue about numbers that players clearly have over him then there is literally no help for your baby brain.**  **So now that I have provided you with literally every named player being better in numerous stats/categories, how about you give me evidence that Luka is better than these players? I'll wait.**"
"&gt;Dude just accept you are wrong. Every coach, player and media member has given Luka that praise,  every big time podcasted on NBA writer have given Luka that love  You talk like you have so many sources that you can bring on the matter yet never actually have any substance behind anything you say. Giving Luka praise is deserved, he's a good player, but no ones fucking putting him above Curry, KD, and Harden like you are, you baby brained imbecile.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;everything with a brain realizes this besides people like you who can’t give him credit because he is young.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;It’s sad man. Luka could never improve one bit, he’ll he could get 20% worse as a player and you would give him more respect in 5 years then you are right now just because he is young  Are you dense? I've given Luka nothing but praise in any of my posts. He's phenomenal. The reason I bring up his age is because he STILL HAS MORE AHEAD OF HIM TO ACHIEVE you fucking idiot. **This is a good thing when I say this, and is also the reason I say he has the potential to be better than these named players but is not better than them now.**  You are legit ignorant and your baby brain shows with the bullshit you say. Lmao, ""people on podcasts gave him praise"" doesn't give you the right to say some absurd shit like he's currently better than fucking Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry. Get the thoughts of his dick going down your throat out of your head and try to think clearly. Even when the thread got taken down a notch to top 3 offensive player instead of top 3 overall a lot of people still don't have him above these players, as you can see evident in these threads."
"IMO, that changed after his MVP years. He spent the last few selling calls and flailing his legs on the occasional 3 like everyone else.    https://247sports.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/Article/warriors-assistant-coach-encourages-stephen-curry-sell-fouls-109538160/"
"Counterpoint - you need to be at least an average defender like Curry or Kyrie were. When you're a below average defender or just straight up bad on that end of the floor as a point guard, it's going to be very difficult to be legit in the postseason, no matter how skilled you are offensively.  Also, Curry and Kyrie were the elite of the elite when it came to point guards offensively, and they were often guarding each other anyway.  Look at the last 15 NBA champions and their point guards:  Kyle Lowry  Stephen Curry x2  Kyrie Irving  Stephen Curry  Tony Parker  Mario Chalmers x2  Jason Kidd  Derek Fisher x2  Rajon Rondo  Tony Parker  Gary Payton  Tony Parker  All of those guards are at least average on the defensive end, with Tony Parker or Kyrie Irving being probably the worst on that end of the floor, while you have some excellent defenders like Payton, Lowry, Rondo, and even Kidd or Chalmers. I feel like Curry and Kyrie are more or less the exception"
  Here's from 35+  * Stephen Curry- 3-23 (13%) * Damian Lillard- 8-17 (47%)  It's also worth weighting Dame's to more recent years as he's improved over time.
you’re still going off of seeding from last season? the bubble is an entirely new season and the best teams in previous seasons are never guaranteed to repeat that success. Luka is coming. Kawhi won fmvp playing worse than a box-and-1 stephen curry with g league players. he won his other fmvp for guarding lebron. yall really overrate kawhi. his defense took a massive fall since 2014. and PG has consistently been one of the worse post season players ive seen in recent memory

Stephen Curry was a better basketball player than Damien Lillard.  Stephen Curry is a better basketball player than Damien Lillard.  Stephen Curry will continue to be a better basketball player than Damien Lillard.
How can Stephen Curry be the best player in the world if he's not even the best player in his family?
"I'm talking out my ass but I brought links to actual stats and you just talk.   &gt;No disrespect to Lillard, but in previous years Curry has shown why he’s the better shooter from deep. Going back to the 2019 NBA Playoffs, Curry made the most shots from 25 to 29 feet. According to stats.nba.com, Curry led all players in the playoffs making 67 shots, and Lillard made 35. Curry also made more shots than Lillard from 20 to 24 feet and remember that’s only in the playoffs.  &gt;During the 2018-19 regular season, Curry made 234 shots from 25 to 29 feet, while Lillard made 175. Now this season was different because Curry dealt with an injury for a good portion of the season.

KD and Kawhi are both better. Luka is arguably better as well as he’s only 21. That is not to even mention Stephen Curry or Giannis. So top 5? Dame is better at this moment too lol
"Yes. Easily.  I mean, not ""easily"", but I will paraphrase Stephen A. Smith: as long as Draymond Green, Klay Thomson and Steph Curry are healthy, there will never be four better teams in the Western Conference."

wait wait so let me get this straight   &amp;#x200B;  you think Stephen Curry : the 3 time champion and 2 time MVP is fake franchise player ?  &amp;#x200B;  are you high ? are on LSD or acid ?

Dropping a memeable call from 2017 isn’t really an argument
"Stephen Curry  I know casuals on here cling onto the 2016 Finals like their life depends on it but other than that series, he has elevated his game in the playoffs.   He led a 6th seed Warriors team to upset the 57 win 2012-13 Nuggets in his playoff debut  He has signature games in the playoffs:  2015 First Round vs Pelicans Game 3 where he hits the crazy corner 4 over 2 Pelicans to send the game into OT, finishes with 40 pts  2015 WCF vs Rockets Game 3 where he takes over a must-win game for the Rockets, down 2-0 coming home to Houston for game 3. He finishes with 40 pts in a GSW blowout to put them up 3-0.  2015 Finals vs. Cavs Game 5 where he scores 17 in the 4th and puts GSW on his back on his way to 37 pts, including 2 dagger 3s over the 'Curry-stopper' Dellavedova to put GSW up 3-2.   2016 WCSF vs. Portland Game 4, the famous 'I'm here, I'm back' game where he comes off the bench coming off of short rest from an MCL sprain and proceeds to drop 40+, including a playoff record 17 in OT to will GSW to victory   2016 WCF vs. OKC Games 5-7, with GSW down 3-1, Steph stepped. He had a great game 5, scored 30+ and had an all around great game 6 while Klay stole the stage, and had a clutch game 7 with 36 points including the dagger 3 at the end  2017 Finals vs. Cavs Game 2, where he has a triple double   2018 WCF vs. Rockets Game 7, where he hits big 3 after bug 3 to help GSW come back and win the game and advance to the finals   2018 Finals vs. Cavs Game 2, where he hits a finals record 9 3s  2019 WCSF vs. Rockets Game 6, scores 33 in the 2nd half on the road, without KD, including 2 dagger 3s over PJ Tucker to eliminate Houston  2019 WCF vs. Portland (Whole series) Averages 36.5 points, most ever in a WCF, on great shooting to sweep Portland. Helped GSW overcome 3 17 pt deficits to sweep.   These are just some of hus signature games, he has had some great games in between obviously."

"Stephen Curry, he can shoot it from literally anywhere"
"Kyle Lowry is not a basketball player that only obtains field goals through spot up shooting from beyond the arc. His shot selection is not only restricted to open field goal attempts from the corner as a result of his offball movement, bitch. His game does not resemble that of JJ Redick, but rather that of Stephen Curry while at the same time being a god human being. However, unlike Stephen Curry, Kyle Lowry is not considered a pussy. An example of this is evident through his multitasking ability where he is able to attempt a field goal from half court while engaging in fisticuffs with his opponents."
"All I need to say is:  They still have a timeout  Decide not to use it  Curry, way downtown!  BAAAANG! BAAAANG!  OH WHAT A SHOT FROM CURRY  With 6 tenths of a second remaining  The briliant shooting of Stephen Curry continues"
Stephen Curry IS range.
"Math is the reason 3-PT shooting is as important as it is today, Steph just showed how more valuable it can be when you have the greatest shooter ever.  The problem is very simple, i happen to believe Kevin Garnett and Stephen Curry are both in the 15-20 range of greatest of all-time, both in their primes to save your life, who would you pick? KG could win games in his prime without scoring, that's how great of a defender (and passer btw) that he was.  I can't emphasize this enough, Steph plays one side of the game and there's no player in the Sacred 11 (Jordan, Magic, Kareem, Wilt, LeBron, Duncan, Kobe, Bird, Shaq, Hakeem and Russell) that was like this to this extent (no, not even Magic or Bird, they were nice underrated defenders). Defense matters and it matters a lot, especially when you are grading all-time greats like this.  There's a reason that, despite Steph having revolutionized the game and being the greatest shooter ever by a freaking mile, he has never in his life been the best basketball player in the world."

"Dirk is special in that he usually keeps his efficiency come post-season, while some players (e.g. Karl Malone) drop off quite a bit come post-season.  One way to gauge great scorers is to narrow down the list from regular season numbers because there aren't really any players who jump from poor regular season scorers to great post-season scorers. You can choose different cut-offs, but looking at players with multiple seasons at 27 PTS/75 and +5 rTS, you get:  * James Harden (5x) * Adrian Dantley (2x) * Dirk Nowitzki (2x) * Amar'e Stoudemire (2x) * Michael Jordan (4x) * Stephen Curry (4x) * Kevin Durant (8x) * Karl Malone (7x) * Shaquille O'Neal (7x) * LeBron James (6x) * Ricky Pierce (2x) * Wilt Chamberlain (2x)  There are some notable exceptions, like Kareem and Jerry West, but they were usually hyper-efficient on slightly lower volume. Change the cut-offs to slightly to slightly lower volume, but higher efficiency and you'll find them.  Personally, I'd put Dirk around 10. I'd put him behind:  * Michael Jordan * James Harden * Kevin Durant * Shaquille O'Neal * LeBron James * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * Jerry West  I'd also consider putting Adrian Dantley and Wilt Chamberlain over him too. They were very much black-holes, but they could score.  The notable person not mentioned above is Kobe, who never reached the +5 rTS mark, but I'd probably put him just beneath Dirk rounding out the lower end of the top 10 scorers list.  So I'd probably have Dirk right around 8-12."
"What do you mean ""meaningful""? Not everyone can luck into having Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant as teammates lol. How about you judge their actual play on the court rather than the accomplishments they had as a result of having superstar teammates?  T-Mac had an MVP caliber season in 2003, Klay has never come close to that. T-Mac has made All-NBA First two times, Klay has never even made an All-NBA First or a Second Team. T-Mac is a 7x All-NBA player, Klay is a 2x All-NBA player. T-Mac has been a #1 for many years, Klay has never been one."
"Based on their careers so far, I would say this is what the current HOF picture looks like for active players.  Among active players, I would say the locks are Lebron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Pau Gasol, Anthony Davis, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, Giannis Antekoumpo, and Luka Doncic.   Guys that will probably get in are Kevin Love, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Blake Griffin, Marc Gasol, and Derrick Rose.  Guys that might get in are Lamarcus Aldridge, Draymond Green, Kemba Walker, Andre Iguodala, and Joel Embiid.   There's quite a few other guys that are too early into their careers to make a judgment on, like Jayson Tatum, Ben Simmons, KAT, etc."

"People forget that fuck  you three that ended Denvers run, while getting a 50 pt triple double and the nba record at the same fucking game. Russ was absurd that season and when you see people saying russ got snubbed as an all star starter against stephen fucking curry, youcan  seehow absurd his season was."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/andybailey/2019/05/12/stephen-curry-not-kevin-durant-is-the-golden-state-warriors-best-player/#1af46e3d7b23  This says otherwise? They don't link their data set. I distinctly remember reading multiple times from Ben Taylor and other Cleaning the Glass posts that Curry has better on/off numbers. They played together for 3 years so I'm not sure one year is going to be the best example.
Has Damian Lillard surpassed Stephen Curry as the best PG in the league?
"How many stars in the league has more irrational haters than Curry? Kendrick Perkins, Jay Williams, Max Kellerman, Nick Wright.  Let's not include equal opportunity haters like Stephen A Smith.  The other most hated guy I can think of is Westbrook and he's got Colin Cowherd and Jason Whitlock. That's about it. LeBron has Skip. Harden has Kellerman. Giannis has Ryan Hollins (idk if he still has a job in the media). It's mostly 1 or 2 irrational haters for the other stars."
"Stephen Curry is 6'3, 190 pounds, 6'3 wingspan, with a 29.5"" standing vert leap, not overly fast or quick. He's had multiple injuries causing him to miss 60 or so games over his first three seasons. He then goes on to win 3 ships, and 2 MVPs with one being the only unanimous MVP ever.   He's not a freak athlete with crazy speed and quickness and 6'6, 6'8, 6'11 215lbs + with a 40+ inch vertical.   I don't know how or why people can or would disrespect him."
Just a reminder that Stephen Curry is a three time champion and the only unanimous MVP in history..

"""Damian is clutch as fuck in the playoffs""  I don't want to hate on Dame, because he's one of my favourite players, but I really think his playoff performances are a little overhyped. For example, even though he played out of his mind in the 1st round of last year's playoffs, he really struggled after that, it was mostly thanks to CJ that they made it past the Nuggets. And then in the conference finals the Blazers got swept... By the Warriors... Led by Stephen Curry. (Without KD, btw) I don't understand your argument here."
"Just for fun, here's this year's top 10 vs last year's:  2019 top 10| PPG | 2020 top 10 | PPG ---|---|----|---- James Harden | 36.1 | James Harden | 34.4 Paul George| 28.0 | Bradley Beal | 30.5 Giannis Antetokounmpo| 27.7 | Damian Lillard| 30.0 Joel Embiid | 27.5 | Trae Young | 29.6 Stephen Curry| 27.3 |Giannis Antetokounmpo | 29.5 Kawhi Leonard | 26.6 | Luka Dončić | 28.8 Devin Booker| 26.6 | Russell Westbrook | 27.3 Kevin Durant | 26.0 | Kawhi Leonard| 27.1 Damian Lillard | 25.8 | Devin Booker| 26.6 Kemba Walker| 25.6 | Anthony Davis | 26.1"
Stephen Curry has shot at least 40 percent from 3 in every season he has played in (not including seasons missed due to injury) Dame has never done it once in his career
Stephen Curry and the Warriors? Yes I agree.
That's wild imagine working out with Stephen Curry
"Not really. Curry because of his limited size can be kind of shut down. Cant shut down a big wing like lebron kawhi or kd. Even kerr said this. Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."""
ESPN: Carlisle doesn't think Stephen Curry is a great player
"ESPN: ""Stephen Curry lists Paul George ahead of Anthony Davis when discussing the best players in LA"""
"Still inexcusable that Shaq and Kobe had as many MVPs as Steve Nash or Stephen Curry.    Kobe should've been the MVP in 2003 and 2006 and Shaq should've won in 2005, but idiot voters like Ramona Shelbourne voted for narratives instead of who had the best season."

"Stephen Curry and Dame are the same body type. Imagine Curry doing this every night, he be close to unbeatable."
Stephen Curry is the most disrespected player in the NBA.
dame is literally the dollar general version to Stephen Curry’s Niemen Marcus. And that’s a compliment to lillard that he even has a place in a sentence alongside Curry
"LOWER defensive rating is BETTER. Defensive Rating measures the amount of points per 100 possession given up when that player is on the court.   HIGHER offensive rating is BETTER. Offensive Rating measures the amount of points per 100 possession scored when that player is on the court.   So Klay is a better defender as indicated by the stats (108 for Klay, 115 for CJ), which back up my point that the two players are not identical. In addition Klay is a more efficient scorer with a career 58% TS, and McCollum with a career 55% TS. In the playoffs, this becomes 53% TS for McCollum and 56%TS for Klay, so the difference still there.  Continuing off that, this means that Stephen Curry dominates Damian Lillard Offensively AND Defensively. He has a 5 point higher defensive rating and 7 point higher offensive rating. So these are NOT comparable. Curry also has a greater WS/48 and BPM than Damian Lillard. He is more efficient (62%TS vs. 58%TS) also. There is almost no metric that will support that Damian Lillard is on par to Curry  So the stats you brought up help prove my point. There is a reason Golden State consistently was at the first seed even before Kevin Durant came. Stephen Curry has been head and shoulders above other point guards in the league."
"Trump is an idiot but I can agree with his statement because some NBA players are very dumb - Stephen Jackson, Dwight Howard, Terrence Davis, and MPJ come to mind most recently.  I don't think his comments were directed towards them though and were probably directed towards some of the more intelligent NBA folks like LeBron, Curry, Pops, Kerr, etc."
Damian Lillard shoots 39% from 25–29 feet on 6.5 attempts a game. Stephen Curry shoots 23% from 25-29 feet on 6 attempts a game. Is that enough evidence for you?
"&gt;I'm really not worried about AD lol Jokic turns up in big games and AD turns down. LeBron is obviously terrifying tho, so he might create enough spacing for AD to do something.  Sorry for the late reply lol my bad, I meant to reply to this comment last night but I got tired.  Anyways, I think that's kind of a silly statement. If I was a Denver Nuggets fan, I'd be worried about both the Lakers superstars if I were to go against them in a 7 game series where they go all out. Anthony Davis has averaged 30 points, 10.3 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 2.33 blocks on 60.4% TS% in 3 games against the Denver Nuggets this season. Nikola Jokić has averaged 17.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists, and 0.66 blocks on 59.4% TS% against the Lakers in 3 games this season. Mind you that Anthony Davis has locked down Nikola Jokić in the clutch this season multiple times, which is very hard to do since Nikola Jokić is really freaking good. I really Nikola Jokić too. So yes, you should at least be slightly worried about Anthony Davis regardless since he's a monster on the defensive end as well. Anthony Davis is a top 2 or 3 Defensive Player of the Year candidate this season for a reason (rhyming accidentally lol), he has the ability to really affect a game on the defensive end while putting up a very efficient 30 points and 10 rebound double double. It's kind of hard to ""overrate"" that when Anthony Davis is considered a top 5-7 player in the NBA this season and some past seasons, depending on if you count Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry this season due their unfortunate injuries.  And not to mention that Anthony Davis is definitely best at the center position due to spacing, where he'll play more often in the NBA Playoffs, where his numbers will definitely go up. AD didn't want to be a full-time center during the regular season because of wear and tear, which makes sense. He plays center with the bench unit and during most closing lineups depending on the matchup. He's played about 40% of his possessions this season at the center position according to CleaningTheGlass's website. He's said he's fine with playing at the center position when the games really matter, aka the NBA Playoffs lol  Anyways, sorry for the lengthy reply, my bad lmao 😂😂😂"

"in what way is Harden a better shooting guard than Klay?  They matched up in 16, no Stephen Curry that series, and Klay, the number 1 option put Harden away in 5 games. With post season facts, show me how Harden performs better than Klay Thompson in their SG role  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT; Klay is leagues above Harden defensively and Harden is not leagues above Klay offensively. Any amount of points Harden puts up Klay can match it in less time and in less shots. Klay wasn’t carried to his rings, and consistently performs when games are on the line. Again, how is Harden a better SG than Klay? Because he’s a number 1 option and Klay isn’t? Wtf is Klay supposed to do when Curry is on your team and then KD is on your team. And I’d honestly put money on NBA GMs picking Klay for their team over Harden. 3 rings, kid"

"LeBron.  He's hit &gt;60% of his lay ups every season after his rookie year, with some years exceeding 70%.  His combination of size, strength, explosiveness, body control, and BBIQ make his ability to convert lay up attempts incomparable.  Honorable mentions: Tony Parker, Goran Dragic, Stephen Curry"
1. Chicago Bulls - Stephen Curry  2. Charlotte Hornets - Karl Anthony Towns  3. Washington Wizards - Klay Thompson  4. Sacramento Kings - Trae Young  5. New Orleans Pelicans - RJ Barrett   6. San Antonio Spurs - John Collins  7. Phoenix Suns - Collin Sexton  8. Memphis Grizzlies - Cam Reddish
"""With the first pick of the reduction draft, the Chicago Bulls select Stephen Curry"""
"If I were to compare Booker with Kobe the elephant in the room would be defense. Don't see how Luka gets comparisons to MJ, Lebron, and Giannis without factoring defense as well. Luka still has a big gap between himself and them and the only other way he can close it besides defense is if he becomes a Stephen Curry type elite 3 point shooter but that is just as unlikely as Luka has been below average 3% and ft% two years in a row and Curry is one of the best of all time."
Nobody expected Josh Richardson to turn into prime Stephen Curry
"Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James.

Haha Dame over 2 time mvp and 3 time champion Stephen “Chef” Curry amirite??
"&gt;He’s the most transcendent guard of our generation  No that’s Stephen Curry and you don’t need the guard distinction for that  His holes are intrinsically linked to his positives lol. This a lot of box scoring masturbating without any analysis. Counting one’s assists has nothing to do with a great playmaker (See: Greivis Vasquez, Kings Rajon Rondo). He can make very particular passes (lobs off backcuts, chest pass to the corner off a drive)  better than anyone but there are many reads he misses or just isn’t good at. His “undeniable passion” turns into a just as big of a negative as it is a positive when he’s having a poor game  &gt;Perennial winner   He had the worst seeding for an MVP in like the last 30 years because he hit a aesthetically pleasing set of averages on the highest usage rate of all time (Which is super impressive in itself, but not necessarily when comparing to other MVP winners). Without KD (top 15-20 player ever) he lost in the 1st round 3 straight years, including one with a MVP finalist teammate. This year he joins an MVP in his prime and the team technically does worse than they did last year. Remember the year KD was hurt almost the entire season? The Thunder missed the playoffs.   &gt;His combination of playmaking and athleticism at his size has never been seen before   If you’re saying he’s a half foot shorter and lower IQ version of 2005 Lebron, then I guess you’re right  Russ is a legend tho I just don’t like your assessment"
"Tyler ""Stephen Curry"" Herro"
"never forget, the minnesota timberwolves picked TWO point guards over stephen curry."
No.  He died to so that he can leave and go to San Francisco to be with his BFF Stephen Curry.
No Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant really hurts ratings. Those are probably the 2nd and 3rd most popular players in the league after Lebron.
"My retort to that is because if Jordan gets fouled, it’s easier to tell.  If Lebron is fouled, you cant tell easily because he’s stronger and you’d say he can take it. Shaq, Dwight gets hacked so often but people will just say suck it up. And in this game, the flagrant was the only trip lebron got to the line.   Funnily, Stephen Curry even more so hardly gets foul calls so at some point Kerr told him to sell the fouls."
"“But like over who though”  Dude....Jerry west and Stephen Curry are not better players than Kevin Durant.  They lack size &amp; defense. There’s just a different level of impact you reach at KD’s size.    Statistically, Durant is closer to Bird and many stats also have him better than Kobe too like BPM/Win shares per 48, etc."

"They say Jamal Murray is the “Canadian” Curry, ergo “Maple” Curry. Canadians then say, “excuse me, bruh, more like Stephen Curry is ‘Burger’ Curry,” i.e. the “American” Jamal Murray. Wait, American Jamal Curry? Idk, sleep now."

Iguodala was given a finals mvp over Stephen Curry in 2015 and Steph received no votes at all not even one. He averaged more points and assists. There definitely is some sort of media bias when it comes to Steph.
Wardell Stephen “Anthony ‘Steph Curry’ Davis” Curry
Why would one MVP vote change anyone's opinion on Stephen Curry?
"Lucky shot? Brotha, Kyrie Irving outplays Stephen fucking Curry in their head2head matchups in the playoffs. 27ppg in his career against the warriors to go along with 3 finals appearances, 1 chip, and a 1-1 record if not for KD joining them. I guess you think MJ’s shots are lucky too."
"Kyrie averaged a 27-4-4, outplayed Stephen Curry, and hit the game-winning 3 in game 7 of the 2016 Finals.  I know he's a weirdo and that everyone hates him, but his legacy isn't going to be lessened by a team he doesn't even play for anymore."
"So we're calling a zero ring, 7th in MVP voting, never a first option, 8 first round exits, inflated assists point guard over Wardell Stephen Curry II huh"

"&gt; is it unreasonable to consider he was on the verge of decline?  Imo, yes. I think people rush to ""call"" these things like Stephen A. Smith. They make these absurd absolute statements too early when sometimes you gotta wait and see.  &gt; nah. when curry and kd won lebron was clearly better.  Sure, in your opinion.

"&gt; Again he’s responding to someone currently holding the suspension against the Cavs team.  And again, why would Draymond suspension being brought up (which I agree shouldn't be brought up like injuries FWIW but that's also irrelevant because of the following) and having a narrative around LeBron getting into Draymond's head would be mutually exclusive? Especially when the fact that people bringing up Draymond not playing in the double 41 match does not, or at least should not based on basic logic, negate the historical fact that we indeed had a very full run of the ""LeBron got into Draymond's head, he knew his suspension was coming up, genius move"" narrative at the time?  If there is no mutual exclusivity between them, then a defence of OP's argumentation based on ""people point out Draymond suspension as hindrance to GSW"" fails, doesn't it?   Also going back to OP's comment, of course people would mythologise if something similar happened to Jordan. Say, Chicago is down 3-1 to Utah in one series and Jordan gets Stockton suspended for the next match. But also years later, people would bring up Stockton missing the 5th match rather than constantly praising Jordan for getting him suspended. IMO I don't think it'd be different if it happened that way in a Utah vs Chicago series because the counter-reaction to the GSW and Stephen Curry love fest from the 2015-16 RS was *strong* after 2016 Finals."
And if I recall the year after Stephen curry once again beat Lebron 3 rings 4 years
"I mean he only started 4 games and broke his hand in the 4th....  He goes on cold streaks. plus he was getting no spacing from his teammates who were basically G-leaguers, he got all the defensive attention.   Luka is amazing, but Steph is literally a top 15 player all time man. Not saying it’s impossible, but as the above comment said we might as well call him the GOAT if he makes the gap between him and Stephen fucking Curry visible next year."
"Was that before or after Curry won a unanimous MVP or before or after Curry led the GSW to the greatest season in league history Stephen curry alone without his other superstar teammates has a +14 per 100 possession point differential, and that team will still lead the league."
"With Stephen curry alone, the GWS has the best offence in the league"

Are you saying that Anthony Davis is a better player than Stephen Curry?
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award  ""The award is decided by a panel of eleven media members, who cast votes after the conclusion of the Finals.""  C'mon man, no need to be argumentative. And I was right, at least in the story existing. Apparently Nick Wright claimed the vote was tied between Curry and Lebron 4-4(assumedly with 3 other votes going to Igoudala), and the Curry voters changed to Iguodala to prevent Lebron from winning FMVP.  HOWEVER, the NBA senior vice president of basketball communications, Tim Frank, denies that claim.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2839460-nba-refutes-claim-lebron-james-andre-iguodala-tied-in-2015-finals-mvp-voting  https://twitter.com/tfrank14/status/1135965234517012482  Honestly though, if the reality of the situation is that Stephen fucking Curry, who averaged 26/5/6/2 PTS/TRB/AST/STL on 44/38.5/88.5 splits in those finals, didn't garner a single vote from 11 media members, it's a worse sin than voter collusion to prevent a losing player from winning FMVP.  So thanks for forcing me to research it to find out that the results were worse than I proposed lmao"

Stephen Curry is the 3rd best player since the Jordan era.
"1. Blake Griffin: Seeing his rookie season highlights is what first drew me to the NBA  2. Damian Lillard: No explanation necessary  3. Boban Marjanovic: Not gonna lie, he's my favorite player in the league who isn't a Blazer  4. Stephen Curry: I feel like even now we are already forgetting how dominant he was  5. LeBron James: Impossible to talk about the decade without talking LeBron  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo: He does things that no other player can do. To me the only player with cooler highlights is Blake Griffin  7. CJ McCollum: As a Blazer fan I promise to NEVER let the legacy of CJ McCollum fade. Best player of the decade to never make an All-Star team, easily.  8. Kevin Durant: Like LeBron, you can't really talk about the decade without talking about Durant. Honestly he's never been that exciting to me but he has to make this list  9. Kawhi Leonard: Another player I begrudgingly add to this list for the same reason as Durant  10. LaMarcus Aldridge: I can't talk about that amazing 2014 series against Houston without going over Aldridge's legendary games 1 &amp; 2  edit: I can't believe I left out Jusuf Nurkic.

"Huh? In what world did Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson not use relocations through multiple games ? You’re a Warriors fan, that’s literally Curry’s bread and butter.   All I had to do was watch 5 minutes of the series highlights just now to see that isn’t true lmao."
"What is his ceiling then? I think he figured out how he can thrive in this league but I also don't see anything other than marginal improvements to his game to make it more complete a la Jimmy Butler. I think you have a little bias against Butler but also bias for Siakam as well. I can think of 15 players I would rate over Siakim easily. Keeping in mind that this has been Siakms breakout year and needs to come back just as good or better in order to knock a few off the list in my mind.   In no particular order LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Russell Westbrook, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Karl Anthony Towns, Chris Paul, currently Jimmy Butler and I would rate Kemba Walker over him currently and Jrue Holiday for his elite defense over Siakim. You could even make a case for Jayson Tatum being ranked over Siakim with their similar stats and role on their team and how that team performs.   That is just my opinion obviously and I think I listed almost 20 but yeah. You could try to make a case for the 15-25 for now but I don't see Siakim challenging Lebron, Durant, Harden, Curry, Leonard, Irving, Davis, or Giannis for a spot to just be in the top 5 conversation. To think at any point of the season Siakim was a top 5 player and has transcendent talent like any one of these guys shows an incredible bias."

"I think you mean Trae Young in *the shooter* category, but I disagree with your placement. Trae might be known for the same shooting location as Steph and Dame, but he does not hit all of his 3-pt shots at even close to the same clip.

"Kawhi played bad, no excuses. But nephew take with the Curry over Kawhi cuz of this series. Stephen shot 8-21, 8-20, and 6-19, three close out games in a row, in the 2016 finals up 3-1 as well."
"Steph won back to back mvps and led his team through the west in both of those years. Beating Kevin Durant, James harden 2x, lebron, and Anthony Davis in those runs. Stephen curry is more of a winner than Kevin Durant."
"So all those new balance ads saying “new king in town”  means nothing. Stephen curry got trashed for blowing a 3-1 lead. He’s pretty humble. He was winning with other great leaders around him, something he’s not."
Stephen Curry lite with hops. Sounds too similar to Lillard.

Don't even compare Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant to Kawhi Leonard. Those two would never blow a 3-1 lead.
"Yea. I make fun of opposing players’/teams’ game. Im not gonna make fun of their their upbringing or the color of their skin, or some other irrelevant shit like that.

"&gt;In 2019-20, he made 41.1% of his 246 unassisted 3-point shots.

It doesn't even work if you add in his 13 unassisted threes during the playoffs.  Curry's numbers don't line up at all, either:  &gt; Out of 16 NBA players who tried at least 200 unassisted 3s this season, nobody was more accurate than Tatum, who sank 41.1% of them. How good is that? In 2018-19, Stephen Curry led the NBA by sinking 40.9% of 291 attempts.  Shooting 40.9% on 291 attempts is 119 makes.   [Curry](https://stats.nba.com/player/201939/shooting/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs) made 110 unassisted threes in the regular season and another 39 in the playoffs."

Oh yeah I've heard of Blake Griffin... but during that time didn't the Warriors dominate with Stephen Curry? I feel like Clippers are never a team that can dominate. That feels like a time where the good teams cool down and transition since that's during a time when a bunch of weird teams were winning.
"I'm not gonna pretend to be an x and o expert because I'm definitely not, but the conventional windom in the NBA has become you have to switch everything to guard the terrific passing and shooting you see today. You see a lot of the best teams do it and you read so many articles about it. I think defensive versatility is key as different teams require different strategies, but switching has become important aspect of defenses for teamd that have the personnel, especially in the 4th.   I was reading articles about it earlier as I find motion offenses and defensive switching fascinating to watch. Here are some excerpts from an article:  Classic schemes for defending pick-and-rolls, the league's most popular play, are no longer capable of containing today's high-octane attacks. In fact, they're what modern analytically inclined teams are built to defeat.  Blitzing pick-and-rolls with traps or ""hedges""—meaning the big man guarding the screener has to leap out at the ball-handler before quickly darting back to his original assignment—leave two men on the ball, which triggers rotations. That leads to scrambling, which leaves soft spots vulnerable to triples—especially against teams that pride themselves on whipping the ball around the floor.  Ducking under the screen is a no-no when you have snipers like Stephen Curry, James Harden and Damian Lillard (seen in the video below) effortlessly launching moonbeams from 30 feet out.  Going over and letting the man guarding the screener relax invites rim runs, which leads to help, which triggers rotations, which leads to wide-open threes when the ball is rotated.  The solution, some teams have found, is to switch assignments on pick-and-rolls, positions be damned. ""Switching lets you guard pick-and-rolls with two men instead of five,"" an Eastern Conference assistant coach told B/R. ""It keeps you out of rotations.""   Many NBA coaches, players and insiders believe this tactic is the most effective way to guard the play, and teams are deploying the strategy more and more. It's also one prompting all sorts of changes across the NBA landscape.  ""Traditional defense can't guard guys the way they play today,"" D'Antoni said. ""That's why we're starting to see more switching—because defenses can't keep up.""  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2739086-inside-the-nbas-most-essential-defensive-tactic.amp.html"
I don't miss the part where they go to finals every year. But I do miss Stephen Curry and seeing his terrific shooting abilities. although James harden kinda replaced him on that.
"Assuming 100% health...  1 - LeBron James 2 - Kevin Durant 3 - Stephen Curry 4 - Kawhi Leonard 5 - Giannis Antetokounmpo 6 - Nikola Jokic 7 - Anthony Davis 8 - James Harden 9 - Damian Lillard 10 - Luka Doncic  PERSONAL OPINION! I can not move Luka higher, I physically cant. Jokic better than AD imo, better leader. Curry above Leonard may be unpopular but goddamn if we get 100% healthy Steph on a KDless team... idk man."
Stephen Curry will go into the front office and ask for a trade if the warriors did that
That's actually crazy...   Dad: Seth Curry  Uncles: Stephen Curry and Austin Rivers   Uncle in law: Damion Lee  Granddad: Dell Curry
Including injured players:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Klay Thompson 3. Kyle Korver 4. JJ Redick 5. Damian Lillard 6. Seth Curry 7. Duncan Robinson 8. Kevin Durant 9. Davis Bertans 10. Doug McDermott
"For their careers, these are the increase in their productions:  Lebron James - 27/7/7 (RS) to 28/7/9 (PS)  Kawhi Leonard - 18/5/6 (RS) to 20/6/8 (PS)  Stephen Curry - 23/4/6 (RS) to 27/5/6 (PS)  So how exactly are their increase more significant than Curry's?"
"Depends on your definition of top tier and best players. Lebron is clearly head and shoulders above anyone in the league today. He's a generational talent like Kobe, Duncan, Jordan, Magic, Kareem, Bird. Those players have led their teams to championships, proven themselves time and time again, and were perennial superstars year after year.  The next ""tier"" are the superstars who didn't quite achieve the same results as the players above. Don't get me wrong. These players were NOT mere allstars. They were superstars who will be remembered long after their playing days, e.g., Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone, Hakeem, Stephen Curry, Allen Iverson, Kevin Garnett, etc.  Then there's the ""stars"" or ""all stars"" who seem to come and go. After 10-20 years, they're largely forgotten or take up media positions to stay relevant. These stars are: Sidney Moncrief, Penny Hardaway, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Carmelo, Vince Carter, Lillard, Westbrook, etc."

You mean Wardell Stephen Curry is what turned them into a dynasty
"Finally somebody putting respect on the GOAT shooter, 2x mvp, 3-time champ, 5 straight finals, **playoff career stats** of 27/5/6 on 50% from 2, 40% from 3 and 90% from the free-throw line Wardell Stephen Curry."
Stephen Curry is the best Nugget right now
"LeBron James Kevin Durant James Harden Chris Paul Anthony Davis Kyle Lowry Jalen Brown Kemba Walker Jayson Tatum Giannis Antetokounpo Khris Middleton Jimmy Butler Kawhi Leonard Paul George Jamal Murray Nikola Jokic Stephen Curry Klay Thompson Draymond Green Luka Doncic Kristaps Porzingis Damian Lillard CJ Mccollum Devin Booker Ben Simmons Joel Embiid Donovan Mitchell Rudy Gobert Jrue Holiday Brandon Ingram Kyrie Irving Bradley Beal  John Wall Karl Anthony Towns Ja Morant Kevin Love Zion Williamson Nikola Vucevic Bam Adebayo Demar Derozan Zach Lavine  I'd easily take those players above Westbrook. Westbrook is raw talent but has poor basketball IQ. He can't make any adjustments because he only knows how to play one way. There's a reason the last time Westbrook shot above 50% in the playoffs besides game 4 was in 2016. All the players I mentioned above can adjust their game and are simply better pairings than Russell Westbrook. I felt bad for the Rockets because Harden should have had the ball every possession but because they couldn't figure out what to do with Russ, they just gave him the ball instead and had Harden stand around. Like I said, Westbrook is a top 20 player to me IF what you want is someone who can carry your team from the trenches and want to sell tickets. He's however, not a very good player from a championship building process. The fact that OKC became a better team without Russ shows just how replaceable Russ can be. The fact that the Rockets, with CP3, was a better version of these Rockets tells me enough. And the fact that Russ continues to play only one way is enough evidence for me to view him as a liability in the playoffs."
"Why not? Why does every star get the luxury of good spacing, but when KD does it all of sudden it’s an issue? I know Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson is overkill, but so is Andre Roberson and Kevin Durant.   If you aren’t going to give him full credit for his Warriors runs, then you have to give him more credit for his Thunder run."
"I don't really get where the narrative that this draft is weak came from. I think Lamelo and Anthony Edwards suck and will be busts, but everything I've seen from James Wiseman is that he looks like a future allstar and would be a great piece to start a rebuild with. There's probably a few other stars at the top of the draft if you ignore the two overrated guards at the top of the draft.  The beauty of Golden State's assets is that Minnesota pick, which should be a lottery pick too, and isn't connected to Golden State's success.  Golden States draft picks would be Rockets choice of 2021 or 2022 pick, and then they could get the Warriors 2027 pick if the Warriors agree to drop the 2025 protections on the pick they owe Memphis.   At that point Stephen Curry will be 38, Harden will be 37, Klay Thompson 35, Draymond 36, so there's a good chance they're back in the lottery by then."
"The mid range is too important to win games and championships. D-Wade, Kevin Durant, Kawhi, even Stephen Curry takes mid range shots and they are all champions and MVP/FMVP's. I don't see why some players don't take those damn shots."
"He literally didn't.  &gt; ""There isn't any surgery or anything in my future this summer. I need to get healthier, but there is no excuses for what happened on the floor,"" Curry said. ""I was out there, ready to play. I had some good games, I had some bad games. And that's it. I'll come back stronger next season and be ready to go.""  &gt;""I'm fine. I mean, I have three months to obviously get ready for next season,"" he said. ""I won't get injured celebrating tonight, I can tell you that much.""  Also last year after he shit the bed against the Rockets  &gt;After Game 3 loss to Rockets, Warriors' Stephen Curry shakes off a question about his dislocated finger messing with his finishing: ""If I'm on the court, I have to produce."""

"It’s possible to be efficient and not skilled. There’s a reason Giannis gets exposed offensively in the playoffs. He has mediocre basketball IQ and an inability to generate a bucket in the half court when a defense crowds the paint / plays zone.   Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Lebron James, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, Stephen Curry, James Harden are players I trust to get me a bucket when I need it most. They can beat double teams, shoot over defenders, and so on. At the very least they have the ability to play make out of a double team.   Giannis needs to develop at least a jump shot to be considered a *skilled* offense player."
"Here's the explanation from the article on the tier 1A/B guys. I'm going to omit some of the tables and graphics just because that would take some time to upload, but I can do so if people are interested:  **Tier 1B: The Great Unknowns**  This group consists of two all-time greats with big questions after they missed all or most of the 2019-20 season. On past production and achievement, each would easily fit into Tier 1A, but after last season there are questions.  **Kevin Durant:**  Let’s get this out of the way up front: I have no idea what a post-Achilles-tear Kevin Durant looks like and neither does anyone else. He’s in this category, for now, because of three reasons.  First is just as recognition of where he was as a player prior to the injury; he’d be not just Tier 1A, but also in the discussion for Tier 1A+ with LeBron James. Second, this is where the Nets need him to be for their gamble on him last offseason to be likely to pay off. I’ve tried to avoid tiering on wish fulfillment as much as possible, but Durant is an inflection point possibly for the entire league. Finally, it is a matter of convenience to have the space to discuss KD at length at the start of this tier rather than buried under the 5,800 words in the Tier 2 write-up. But what can we expect? Past history suggests he won’t be as good. From the linked 2013 study:  Seven players never returned to play an NBA game, whereas 11 players returned to play 1 season, with 8 of those players returning for ≥2 seasons. Players who returned missed an average of 55.9 games. The PER was reduced by 4.57 (P = .003) in the first season and by 4.38 (P = .010) in the second season. When compared with controls, players demonstrated a significant decline in the PER the first season (P = .038) and second season (P = .081) after their return.  That’s a sizable decline, but recall where Durant is declining from. PER is an imperfect, offense-focused measure, but on that metric, a 4-4.5 decline from his peak would still give Durant somewhere around the 10th to 15th highest mark in the league. There simply hasn’t been a player on Durant’s level to suffer this injury before, and we’re left to wonder what parts of his game are more likely to be affected than others and how that changes his profile. Some of the problems of comparing pre- and post-Achilles injury production is that several prominent players who suffered the injury either never really returned to significant action (Mehmet Okur and Mario Chalmers) or were already deep into their 30s, complicating the evaluation of declines given those seasons were in age ranges where a sizable diminution in ability should be expected (Kobe Bryant and Chauncey Billups).  Further, some players aren’t really apposite comparisons, either because of a completely different positionality (Brandon Jennings) or that they were players on the fringe prior to the injury (Jonas Jerebko). That leaves a few examples of starter-level players of similar age (Durant was 30 at the time of the injury) and at least passingly similar size or style of play. Elton Brand and Wes Matthews suffered their injuries at 28, while Rudy Gay was 30. The areas I would most expect to see an injury-related decline to show up would be in rim-finishing and foul-drawing. Additionally, I wanted to look at overall defensive effectiveness, as this has been an enormous part of Durant’s postseason value over his career. Here are the relevant stats in the three to four seasons (depending on the timing of the injury and return to play) before and after each player suffered his injury:  There is a little bit of a range of best, medium and worst cases between the three, but we can probably anticipate some decline in Durant’s ability to get to the rim and perhaps his finishing once he does, while possible effects on defense are more equivocal. If I were an optimist, I would suggest that Gay is the most similar to Durant in terms of both style of play and body type, though it should be noted that Gay is significantly stronger and bulkier, so perhaps better able to compensate for decreased mobility with increased physicality. Durant also has some attributes Gay does not. He’s still close to 7 feet tall with an enormous wingspan, and one of the great jump shooters of all time:  Among the players named up there, Durant has managed this with the most difficult mix of shots by a decent margin. Only 19.7 percent of his 3-pointers have been uncontested, the next lowest percentage among those players is Tatum at 34.2 percent, ranging up to McDermott at 48.5 percent. This suggests that from an efficiency standpoint, Durant has some wiggle room by increasing his shot quality, something that should be possible given the sheer amount of on-ball creation ability the Nets have between Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert.  Barring the absolute worst-case scenario of Durant being functionally done (an outcome for which there has been no evidence of even suggestion of as a possibility), Khris Middleton in Tier 3A seems like an absolute floor for his offensive contributions:  That outcome still represents complete disaster for Brooklyn — one of the reasons I find the early over/under line of a 49.5 win pace for the Nets to be extremely interesting is that based on Durant’s outcome they are likely to be either much better or much worse with not much in between.  As a final point, there are all kinds of reasons why comparisons between the leagues are fraught, but it’s fair to say Breanna Stewart is of similar stature in the WNBA as KD is in the NBA. Here are her last two postseason lines, one before and one a full season after her own Achilles tear:  Though Stewart suffered the injury at 24 instead of 30, her averaging 28/8/4 on 50/50/85 shooting splits has to be taken as a good sign for KD.  **Stephen Curry:**  It feels a little dirty to not have him higher, but he’s 32 and it’s been four full years since he’s been asked to be the main focus of a team. I’m certainly interested in seeing what he looks like at the center of a more heliocentric offense. With the players in Tier 1A, we’ve seen them be that, in several cases over multiple years.  I don’t think I have to go too much into Curry’s game-breaking, court-geometry warping impacts. As the chart above discussing Durant shows, Curry is on the very shortlist for the best shooter of this or any other era. While Kyle Korver might have an edge in “alone in the gym” shooting skill and was an assuredly elite catch-and-shooter off of movement, Curry’s ability to do that plus do the same off the bounce is what lets him to surpass Korver as a “game-effective” shooter. Curry is the only player in the tracking data era who has attempted at least 250 pull-up 3FGA to make at least 40 percent of them (sitting at 41.3 percent, more than two full percentage points ahead of Chris Paul, in second place at 39.2 percent). Among the 10 top-line metrics I used for this exercise, Curry is first among minutes qualified players in:  * 5-year RAPM * 3-year PIPM * 3-year ORAPM * 3-year OPIPM * … and second in 3-year RAPM.  All of which is to say, if that player is what we get after what was basically a gap year, he’s Tier 1A with ease. But there is enough uncertainty that he is just a half step down. For now.  **Tier 1A: The Best of the Best**  Assuming health and/or sufficient playing time, these are players who could be penciled into four of the five First Team slots almost from the start of the season. It’s no accident this group contains the last three MVP winners as well as the last two Finals MVP recipients. Start with one of these players and you have a huge leg up toward championship contention. They don’t guarantee contention on their own, as there is too much talent across the league for any one player to have that kind of impact. But the margin of error is wider and the number of possible paths to the kind of roster that can contend is greater.  **Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden:**   Let me lead with a stat here. Since the 2010-11 season, 19 players have been named to All-NBA First Team at least once. It’s not a perfect overlap, but this is a reasonable first pass at players who have met the general criteria for Tier 1 in terms of being able to lead a team to the Finals as the best player. Of those 19, only five (LeBron, Steph, KD, Kawhi and Tim Duncan) have actually been the best player on a Finals team over the same period. Which is to say that in a league whereby definition only two teams can make the Finals each season (and one player has been the best player on 45 percent of the Finals teams over that period), the set of players who are good enough is far broader than the set who actually have. Managing a championship roster is hard, and it’s no accident that depending on how you count, around three-quarters of this decade’s Finalists were superteams of one form or another — I would certainly count all five Warriors, all four Heat and the first three Cavaliers among that group, as well as the 2012 Thunder, and we can quibble about the 2013 and 2014 Spurs or 2019 Raptors."

"Yeahhh I live in Charlotte sooo. But putting all that aside, here’s Steph talking about his faith:  [THR](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nba-star-stephen-curry-scores-film-tv-pact-sony-1104927)  *“I’ve been blessed to have this platform and I want to use it to affect the world positively,” Curry said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “Partnering with Sony to share inspiring content with a global audience was a foregone conclusion.”  In keeping with Curry’s personal beliefs — he is known to tweet psalms from the Bible to his 12.5 million followers — film and TV development will focus on faith and family-friendly content (which would seem to dovetail nicely with Sony’s Affirm Films label) as well as sports-themed projects.*  [Christian Broadcast Network](https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/june/steph-curry-explains-moment-he-truly-became-a-christian-and-lsquo-gave-my-life-to-christ-rsquo)   “My faith is tested on the court as much as it is in life,” Curry said on the show.  “It’s the part that always keeps me focused on what I need to do when it comes to my family, when it comes to my job, when it comes to how I treat other people, my appreciation for life and all the good things that happen and how to deal with the bad things that happen.”  “I put believer first, because that is supposed to be the roots of everything that I do as a believer, as a husband, as a father, and on down from there.”  “Faith to me is believing in the unseen, and having a conviction that there is a higher power that has given me a purpose to what I am doing on this earth,” he added. “For me, that is the foundation to how I live my life and how I want to see the world through that lens.” ...  He recalled an experience in eighth grade where one of his pastors, Pastor Jason, explained the importance of having your own faith, and not just living off of your parent’s faith, which hit Curry hard.  “I felt a calling, went down to the altar, and gave my life to Christ,” Curry shared. “That became the beginning of my own personal journey.” —  So from his own mouth, since 8th grade. Notice that part about the parents' faith as well.   —  Bonus:  [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/23/black-americans-are-more-likely-than-overall-public-to-be-christian-protestant/)  Nearly eight-in-ten black Americans (79%) identify as Christian, according to Pew Research Center’s 2014 Religious Landscape Study. By comparison, seven-in-ten Americans overall (71%) say they are Christian, including 70% of whites, 77% of Latinos and just 34% of Asian Americans. Meanwhile, about seven-in-ten blacks are Protestant, compared with less than half of the public overall (47%), including 48% of whites, roughly a quarter of Latinos and 17% of Asian Americans.  More than half of all black adults in the United States (53%) are classified as members of the historically black Protestant tradition. This includes those who tell us they belong to specific denominations such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church or the Church of God in Christ. The category also includes black Americans who do not identify with a specific denomination but instead say they associate with a broader Protestant group (e.g., “just Baptist” or “just Methodist” or “just Pentecostal”) that has a sizable number of historically black denominations.  Blacks also are less likely than the U.S. public as a whole to identify as religiously unaffiliated – that is, as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular.” While 23% of the public identifies as unaffiliated, the share among blacks is 18%. This number, however, has risen among blacks and among the overall public. The share of African Americans who identify as religious “nones” grew by 6 percentage points between 2007 and 2014 (from 12% to 18%), similar to the increase among those in the general population (from 16% to 23%).  [Pew again](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/20/black-millennials-are-more-religious-than-other-millennials/)  In recent years, a number of Pew Research Center surveys have shown that Millennials in the United States – young adults born between 1981 and 1996 – are generally less religious than older Americans, based on our core measures of religious commitment. This holds true for black people, in that black Millennials tend to be less religious than older blacks. That said, black Millennials are considerably more religious than others in their generation, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis.  About six-in-ten black Millennials (61%) say they pray at least daily, a significantly higher share than the 39% of nonblack Millennials saying this. And while 38% of black Millennials say they attend religious services at least weekly, just a quarter (25%) of other Millennials do this, according to the analysis based on data from the Center’s 2014 Religious Landscape Study.  In fact, nearly two-thirds (64%) of black Millennials are highly religious on a four-item scale of religious commitment – which includes belief in God and self-described importance of religion, in addition to prayer and worship attendance – compared with 39% of nonblack Millennials.  —"
"Can't say I'm surprised, the other foreign white MVP in Nash also gets shit from players.  Lin/Yao got a lot of crap too, and even Curry didn't seem liked by a lot of players for a while.  Its not a big deal in the big picture but its not really surprising to hear that KG said that.     and he said this on the Stephen Jackson podcast didn't he? Can only imagine the private convo lol."
"Some players' first name is not actually first name. Example : Wardell Stephen Curry, Hyland DeAndre Jordan, Walter Ray Allen."
"The MVP candidates are probably:  Giannis Antekoumpo, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons (if he learns to shoot threes), Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Donovan Mitchell, Luka Doncic, and Stephen Curry.   These realistically are the set of players that have the talent to have an MVP Caliber season (or at least Top 5 in voting) and who are on teams that have a chance to finish at the top of their conference.  Luka's success will largely come down to the Maverick's team success. If they're a low seed, he won't have a chance, but if they're the 1-seed somehow he could get it.  It's too hard to predict, but it usually comes from a guy on the best team, and in both the East/West it's impossible to tell where the top teams will stack up.   Giannis being a 2-time in a row winner definitely helps, but if the Bucks smash everyone in the regular season again and he's far away statistically from everyone else he will probably just win it again."
Seth Curry looks like NBA superstar Stephen Curry
"MVP - Stephen Curry - Warriors get the best record in the league and Curry averages MVP like stats. Lebron finishes 2nd, but takes it too easy. Giannis still finishes 3rd, and has the best stats, and Luka finishes 4th, and then Jayson Tatum finishes 5th. James Harden fans argue he actually has the best stats, but the Rockets winning the 72-game equivalent of less than 50 games leaves Harden without a Top 5 MVP finish, causing him to ask out of Houston at the end of the season.  Finals MVP: Stephen Curry - The Warriors rebound and win the last championship of their dynasty.  DPOY - Anthony Davis - This will be awarded to him for his defense on Jimmy Butler in the finals, despite Giannis and Gobert having a good case for being more deserving."
Sit down nephew. It was just a couple games. Do you know how many slumps Stephen Curry has been in and came back from?
"[Here’s an article on Curry with a lot of stats from a couple years ago, after KD joined.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/) Curry’s team impact is enormous, which was impressive given he was on a stacked team."
"lol, Curry shot 24.5% last year. 24.5%! What the heck is that? What other ""superstar"" could get away with that? As a longtime Warriors fan watching games this season, there was a Curry-sized hole in our team. And granted, that's a pretty small hole, as Curry's a weak, scrawny little twerp, but it was clear none the less -- this wasn't the same Curry we've known over the years. He wasn't even present as a leader for our up-and-coming stars like Juan Toscano-Anderson. His only purpose on our team was collecting his $40 million salary and peaceing out.  When we didn't make the NBA finals this year, I cried. And I *never* cry, especially not in front of my children, but I did this time. My daughter came up to me and said, ""/u/FLUSH_THE_TRUMP, why are you sad?"" I told her I now knew how other franchises felt, having to deal with the hardship of middling success and an aging star weighing your team down.    Thanks for everything, Stephen."
"Are we really going to pretend that one of the all time greatest offensive weapons and MVP did NOT make it easier for Stephen curry? Just because the warriors did it without him, doesn’t mean he didn’t open the game up for the other golden state stars."
"I think in that 15-20 range, but potentially a little higher once he finishes his career.   12. Oscar Robertson  13. Moses Malone  14. Jerry West  15. Karl Malone  16. Kevin Durant  17. Kevin Garnett  18. Stephen Curry  19. Dirk Nowitzki  20. Isiah Thomas"

"&gt;	Losing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson doesn’t mean Warriors should struggle with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green  Shallow ass GSW team loses 2/4 best players (including arguably their best player in the playoffs). Point is they were the biggest lock to win if they had these players in recent history. Before that, Cavs in 2015 would’ve beat GSW with Kyrie and Love.  Every team that wins gets lucky, which is why you should shut the hell up about injuries, but especially if you’re a GS or a Raps fan  You’re damn right GS is gonna be worse than any time during their run. They’re still a threat because they can get hot at any time. But over 7 games... they don’t have the defense to do it IMO"
" Steph Curry in the series   26/5/6 on 59% TS  Igoudala that series   16/6/4 on 59% TS  Igoudala is a great defender but there’s a reason he never held Lebron to that poor of efficiency over a series before that or ever again after, and that’s because Lebron had no other offensive weapons on that team. It was a unique situation, and Lebron shot poorly out of necessity, not because Iggy was shutting him down   Example A of someone thinking Iggy didn’t deserve it at the time: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2015/06/17/andre-iguodala-is-worst-nba-finals-mvp-in-last-30-years/%3foutputType=amp  Example B: https://uproxx.com/dimemag/stephen-curry-finals-mvp-andre-iguodala-warriors/  Example C: Plenty of people in the Reddit thread at the time saying Curry should have gotten it https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3a4ifk/andre_iguodala_named_2015_nba_finals_mvp/  We all watched the series, it’s apparent not all of us understand Steph Curry’s gravity and his offensive impact. The vast majority of NBA media members don’t, they’re reporters and not analysts. I love Rachel Nichols and think the Jump is awesome, I trust her sources when she has info. She’s not an analyst though  I get to decide they’re dumb because there’s no evidence to back up their point other than “Well I watched and felt like Iggy was the best” Eye test doesn’t mean anything when you’re a dumbass reporter who’s job is to get quotes, not understand basketball"
"GS had their fair share of playing against crippled teams. Pelicans without Cousins, Cavs without Kyrie or Love, Rockets with CP3 and Mbah Moute the first year, Kawhi Leonard in SA, POR without Nurkic. Losing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson doesn’t mean Warriors should struggle with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. It’s right there lol you got FMVP Iguodala, Steph Curry, ALL NBA team and DPOY Draymond Green. Sad to think you need Kevin Durant AND Klay Thompson both to beat everyone else. Throw Kevin Durant in with Love, Kyrie, and James and they never lose to any team. Throw Durant on with CP3 and Harden and they beat any team, throw Durant in with Westbrook and they almost beat the 73-9 Warriors. We’ll see how the warriors do without Durant this season. What will be the excuse? Thompson with the ACL injury? Draymond declining? Wiggins being a bum compared to bogut and barnes? I can’t see GS running it back now that durant is gone. It’s LA/LAC for next few years 🤷‍♂️"
So you disagree? Are you saying you think Andre Iguodala is a better player than Stephen Curry?
Stephen Curry. Shot 25% from 3 this season. Hoping we can fleece the Hawks for Trae or someone this off-season.
Stephen Curry
"Stephen curry,  Kay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan   And an Arena with no A/C  That would do the trick easy"
"*Here's how the Lakers can get Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Giannis Antetokounmshevxnkfgshdbkdgd, Steph Curry, Bugs Bunny, Michael Jordan, and Stephen A. Smith in free agency*"
"Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Udonis Haslem, Stephen Curry, Steve Nash"
"""Per @EliasSports, Stephen Curry had a streak of 81 consecutive free throws made in the fourth quarter and overtime in the postseason, a streak that dated back to June 16, 2015.""  Please don't let Max Kellerman ever decide the fate of the universe!"
"He is one of the most skilled players while being tall enough to be a mismatch for the entire league, since his rookie year he has been one of the most prolific scorers, and along his other young and gifted teammates (Rusell Westbrook and James Harden) they would be one of the best teams on the league and reach the finals in 2013 (lost to the LeBron's Miami Heat), Harden was traded after this due to money and role issues.  Eventually he would become the league's MVP and he was respected as a player and as a person; but his team the Oklahoma City Thunder wouldn't catch a break with injuries  to him and his partner Westbrook so a couple of playoff runs were cut short.   It was until the 2016 playoffs that the Thunder was finally healthy and they reached the conference finals (semifinals) and played against an historic and dominant Golden State Warriors (the team that has Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson amazing shooters and Draymond Green a do it all defensive force) that just had broken the most regular seasons win record that the Jordan Bulls had (they won 73 out of 82 games); the Thunder was up 3 games to 1 in a best of 7 games series and statistics pointed out that it was very likely that the Thunder would reach another NBA Finals. This is where it gets messy, the Warriors would come back and eliminate the Thunder reaching the finals for the second year in a row, where the Cleveland Cavaliers (Lebron James's team) would do the same 3-1 comeback.  After those playoffs Durant was a free agent, meaning that his contract was over and he could choose where to sign next, a lot of teams made him offers among those the Warriors, a lot of the media and fans alike expected Durant to run it back with the Thunder being so close to beat the Warriors and him perceived as a OKC player for life. Durant would sign with the Warriors joining the very team that bested his team and making the Warriors being head and shoulders above the rest of the league.  A lot of people wouldn't like this move and would call him names like ""snake"" or so, with the Warriors Durant would win back to back titles and Finals MVP's. He would leave the Warriors due to issues with Draymond Green and him perceiving he was not liked/respected enough as the main player of those titles and being an outsider."
Ah yes well known lock down defenders Allen Iverson and Stephen Curry also both led the league in steals so he's among good company. Hes definitely not top 3 by any margin unless its top 3 defenders on the 76ers?
"For anyone thinking this is reckless and that LeBron should know better, Stephen Curry literally flew to Toronto last month for shoot around at Drake's mansion and the court was filled with like 50 people with no masks on. Just sayin'"
"Derrick Rose, Tony Parker, Steve Nash, Deron Williams, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, John Wall &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"
how is it stupid? what kind of example is that? i doubt neutrals would be a fan of literal **hitler**..  we're just talking about basketball.. there are millions of fans of stephen curry and KD so i was curious if they were the majority vs fans of people like harden/lbj etc in a playoff setting..

"&gt;In the 2017 Finals, Durant's best series in his career, he had an open shot frequency of 27%. In comparison, Stephen Curry open shot frequency 17 Finals- 57.%. LeBron James open shot frequency - 52%.  Lets be real here though. 82.5% of KD's shots his defender was *at least* 2 feet away from him per the NBA tracking data that you are looking at. For a player as long as KD that's pretty much open, not a knock on him but that's hard facts.   [And he was assisted on 65% of his FG's.](https://stats.nba.com/players/scoring/?sort=MIN&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PORound=4) Those shots are virtually always easier to score.   Compare that to LeBron who was assisted on only 31.8% of his shots and Curry at 30% and it's just night and day who had to work harder for their buckets.   Durant benefited an insane amount off of that GSW system. Don't kid yourself."
Stephen Curry with a 40 inch vertical
probably traded for lebron james/stephen curry types
That's a modified image of Stephen Curry and it's freaking me out right now.
2019-20 are all carbon copies. The Wardell Stephen Curry II effect.
"I just want to preface that I value playoff performance VERY heavily. So I got people who perform a little disappointing, not choking just not super duper playoff performers, a little lower.  1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Anthony Davis 5. Nikola Jokic 6. Luka Doncic 7. Giannis Antetokounmpo 8. James Harden 9. Jimmy Butler 10. Damian Lillard  I refuse to put Durant on the list. Dunno if he'll be ready and healthy, and this is coming from a Nets fan. If we talking healthy Durant he right above Steph. If we talking 75% Durant right next to Harden. Anything lower makes him fall out top 10. And btw Jokic &amp; Doncic are legitimately tied for me. I just like Jokic a lot more so I gave him the nod."
"Yeah, let's act that for a 34% 3-pt shooter, which is literally below average, 45% isn't an abnormous outlier that will most likely never get close to happening ever again.  Jamal Murray never had a game with more than 4 3-PT made in the playoffs before the bubble, this year he had five, including two games at 9 3-PT made.  Jamal Murray is a fringe All-Star and nothing more, he will make All-Star teams some years and miss in others, he's not the second coming of Stephen Curry like it looked in the bubble."
1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Garnett 3. Stephen Curry 4. Kevin Durant 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Dwight Howard 9. Anthony Davis 10. Derrick Rose
"Yeah, if those odds are right 4-9 clearly better. I saw a site that had 2-9 though which would put Luka back at 1.   Oddshark using Bovada saying  * Luka Doncic +450 * Anthony Davis	+550 * Giannis Antetokounmpo +650 * Stephen Curry +650 * LeBron James	+900 * Kevin Durant	+900 * Jayson Tatum	+1000 * James Harden	+1200 * Damian Lillard	+1600 * Kawhi Leonard+2000"
"You don't need an insider to see this.  Many former teammates say the same thing.  He may be a star on the field, but he doesn't have the charisma of a LeBron James, a Stephen Curry, an Anthony Davis, or even a Kevin Durant."
Better then Dame 😂. Dame was straight up shooting shots from half court and averaging 37 points per a game in the bubble. Nobody in the league other then Stephen Curry can shoot like that. You trippin bro
hes already stephen curry with a 40 inch vertical
"LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving and KAT are all easily better than Westbrook. There are also strong arguments for Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Chris Paul, Paul George, Ben Simmons, Klay Thompson, and Bradley Beal being better. This list also doesn’t include Kevin Durant. The man is absolutely not top 15."
"LeGM won’t get you Stephen Curry on a bargain contract or anything, but it otherwise has better results than most other approaches teams take."
He had a few game especially in the post season where he looked like Stephen Curry.
"Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Kemba Walker in no particular order"

"No team is winning a championship with rubio as their PG.  I would say the bare minimum to get to win it nowadays would be Conley, Jrue or maybe Wall depending on how he comes back from injuries and that is of course dependant on having elite players in the other positions, which the suns dont have.  Only way you can win a championship with a PG heavy system is if he is named Stephen Curry or Lebron James, Harden still hasnt been able to do it, Lillard even lower chance than Harden and please dont start talking about Westbrook, Simmons, Kemba, Lowry (even if he won one against a hobbled team, they dont win it without Kawhi, they dont even get to the finals without Kahwi).  Now I am willing to bet on Luka and I will put 7 chips outta 10 on Jamal Murray too. Anyone else though? Nah... Not even Trae Young has me going: Yeah this guy can lead a team."
"1) Bob Myers's was promoted to GM on April 24, 2012.  2) He didn't draft Klay in 2011.  3) Larry Riley was responsible for drafting Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Riley_(basketball)"
"I mean, Stephen Curry improved a LOT since he was a rookie. It’s similar to how kobe bryant became an MVP. He wasn’t a star from the moment he was drafted but his dedication and hard work payed off. I feel like the ad represents just how you can hustle even if people are doubting you."
"Nuggets fan here:   2009 WCF: the nuggets looked like they can actually win the series at times but couldn't inbound the ball for shit and couldn't stop kobe in game 6.  2013 first round: nuggets were beating some pretty good teams that year and won 57 games and a third seed. Not many people knew how good the warriors and stephen curry would be and the nuggets choked throughout the series.  2017 last game vs okc: Nuggets since 2012-2013 were pretty shit until in 2017 when jokic was starting to play exceptional. Nuggets climbed there way into playoff contention. Then in that last game vs okc, westbrook hit that game winner of halfcourt to eliminate my team from reaching the playoffs.  2018 play-in game: Thought that year the nuggets were starting to beat good teams again regularly but always choked against bad teams in the regular season. game 82, nuggets were tied with the timberwolves and lost in overtime over a 4th quarter comeback by the nuggets."
"MJ wasn't just a great team player,  He was a man who helped kids trapped in the projects without good coaches get better.  He did this while being a NBA All Star.  The true greats don't just win games,  they are modest or even Humble about it.  Lebron he is very vocal about what he did.  I don't know much about Stephen Curry so I can't compare them.  But I have met MJ in person even shot some hoops with him not long after bulls with MJ won a title.  I believe it was his 6th Championship win.  Me I was a Carpenter at the time doing flooring."
The X factor is this number 2 pick. They actually have some capital to improve with at least a very good Stephen curry and Klay thompson as the core. They aren't out of their prime yet despite coming back from injuries.
"Hey Siri, what's Stephen Curry's record against Lebron James  &gt;They faced each other a total of 35 times in NBA games. Stephen Curry has a 21-14 winning record over LeBron James, including a 15-7 record in Playoffs."
"*1. A total loser without Pippen*  I could argue Mikes numbers from 1984 to 1990 were still astonishing; numbers which, despite losing, still show just how dominant he was, but that would be useless. It's true, Mike never did win much with a shitty team of unprofessional cocaine snorting assholes. What I'll argue is that when Pip was the leader in 1994, with a great team, and the best coach ever, he showed what he was made of. Not only weren't his skills enough, he disappointed the team from a leadership standpoint. Compare that to LeBron who could count on D-Wade and AD on 3 of his 4 rings. Worth to note that MJ and Pip were the only two players on both three-peats. People love to say how Mikes teams got good only when Pip developed and yet never mention how important Mike was in his development. And anyway, you could argue the real gamechanger was Phil and the triangle, cause Pip and MJ + Doug Collins failed miserably. Also, LeBron is also a total loser without good teammates. He needed Bosh and Wade to win his first ring. He needed AD to win his 4th. And even without Kyrie his third is improbable.  *2. Never once beat Larry Bird*  April 20, 1986. Larry Bird on record saying ""that was just God disguised as Michael Jordan"" and ""that's the greatest player ever"". MJ didn't win that game but the person used in this example invalidates this second point. If Larry Bird is a benchmark for greatness, Larry Bird saying you're God at 23 must mean something. And I remind you, it's of a SOPHOMORE Michael Jordan. Imagine Luka Doncic playing so well Lebron is forced to say that this is the best player ever, adding it's God disguised as Luka. That was GOAT level shit from Mike considering he just got better since 1986.  *3. Could never beat a Super Team*  That is complete BS. Firstly because back then there were no such things as superteams, secondly because the closest thing to a superteam was the Jazz with two HOFers / Dream Team players and he handed their ass to them in 6. Twice. Back to back.  *4. The East was terrible*  Firstly, that's bullshit. MJ beat 5 different West teams in the finals, showing even if the East were to be easier, he still was better than the best the West had to offer. The thing about more than 1 Hall of Famer was really dumb. The 1991 Lakers and the 97-98 Jazz had 2 HOFers (but Mike still beat them), but the Blazers, the Suns and the Sonics all had 1 HOFer. The 94 Rockets had only Hakeem before adding Clyde the year later. Point is, even teams in the West didn't usually have more than 1 HOFer. And besides that, winning contributes to your HOF status. So of course if Penny had won he might be a HOFer right now, same goes for Horace Grant. Unfortunately, they were stopped in 96 by a man called Michael Jordan.  *5. Everyone won rings on his watch*  It's easy when you take his Wizards stint, but we all know those seasons have an asterisk when considering Jordans career. His rookie years are dumb too, considering how bad his team was. And Hakeem and Drexler are also dumb considering he played half a season after coming back from baseball. You can maybe hold the 87/88 Lakers and the 89-90 Pistons over his head. If you reason like he did everyone won rings on LeBrons watch; Duncan, Ginobili, Parker, Kawhi, Kobe, Gasol, Pierce, Rondo, Garnett, Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, D Wade, Shaq, Curry, Klay, Durant, Draymond, even the fucking Big Ben-Chauncey Billups Detroit Pistons. What a random fact to state to support LeBrons cause.  Stephen A Smith said a smart thing yesterday: if I'm a hater for saying LeBron is number 2 keep calling me a hater, but I think you have your priorities wrong son.  Edits: some formatting and grammar"

"I'm sorry but curry is a man of religion, what is doing talking to a man of reason and logic. Hey Stephen try praying for a cure that will work."
"1. Kobe Bryant 2. Stephen Curry 3. Luka Doncic 4. Kevin Durant 5. Lebron James 6. Shaq 7. Tony Parker 8. Tim Duncan 9. Blake Griffin 10. Damian Lillard  Not sorted by skill, just my personal preference on who I've enjoyed watching the most."
"I answered your questions. You just wanted to cherry pick. Each paragraph there is a direct answer to your question that you cherry picked.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;By YOUR argument, Westbrook 23.2 ppg 8.3 assists is a better offensive player than Stephen Curry 23.5 / 8.3.   No. That was YOUR argument.  &gt; If LeBron was the all time scoring leader would You be arguing advanced metrics?   You're the one that wanted to use the all time scoring leader markers. I didn't even mention it. All my arguments such as the math for points contributed per game and the efficiency ratings point to SC being better than WB.   There's no problem with my argument regarding offense. it's with yours.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Ah, so the first 3 seasons count again do they? So it’s 4/17 and 6/15 again?   I never said they didn't count. I said the existence of it makes the use of those numbers are problematic.  If you understand basic statistics, I'm calling them a confounder. A piece of data which may have an effect on the end result. Basically, here is the result we have, Jordan has a higher percentage of winning a finals than Lebron, but confounders exist such as Lebron entering the league with less training than Jordan had, and (as you pointed out) Jordan leaving for two years in his prime, both of which affects the results of the calculation. That's basic statistical analysis you should have learned in HS.  It's not cherry picking. I didn't cherry pick any stat/number. I actually presented them ALL, from basic to advanced. And I presented them all saying stats are not enough to differentiate them."
"I noticed you didn’t answer my questions, that’s ok.  The problem with cherry picking numbers like you are is that you need to apply them universally.  By YOUR argument, Westbrook 23.2 ppg 8.3 assists is a better offensive player than Stephen Curry 23.5 / 8.3.  See the problem?  Ah, so the first 3 seasons count again do they? So it’s 4/17 and 6/15 again?  See the issue? Every comment I make and you have to cherry pick something else. It’s asinine."
"Can't make shots when it matters most?  2015-2018 in playoff clutch time:  (Clutch is defined as under 5 minutes to go, game within 1-2 possessions)  Stephen Curry - 4.26ppg on 72% TS (27 games)  Lebron James - 3.24ppg on 48% TS (38 games)  Kevin Durant - 2.1ppg on 48.8% TS (20 games)  This is excluding LeBron's worst finals performances (2007, 2011) and including Steph's worst finals performance (2016)."
Just last year they almost gunned their way into 7 games against a great Raptors defense. Stephen Curry literally changes the geometry of the floor. Curry doesn’t have the athleticism and size to carry but he definitely elevates everyone on the team. Finals Curry is different but his playoff games are ridiculous. Still like the Lakers personnel against them though.
"How can both Jimmy and AD win FMVP when they didnt show up for multiple games? Yeah Jimmy was amazing, and so was AD, but not for every game. LeBron was consistently the best player, and led the team to a win.  And no the FMVP is not picked by a marketing team, if that was the case why didnt everybodys favorite marketable player Wardell Stephen Curry II win it in 2015.  Stop blindly hating, you dont have to agree but being this hyperbolic is not helping your case"
"Green and McGee have the same amount of rings that Stephen Curry has, and one more than KD, jaw dropping for me"
how does it feel for someone to turn into stephen curry all of a sudden heat bros?
"This one reminded me of that one user claiming that he spent time on a thai prison: ""Wow the Warriors are really good now. Is Stephen Curry the best player in the NBA?""   Yeah, there were plenty of weird posts around /r/nba lmao"
"I'd expect your analysis to be better for someone who is so arrogant. I really hope you respond because you somehow think your data is valid when you're comparing the first 6 years of KD's career (omitting his best) to the last five years of KAwhis career (omitting his worst) I dive into this below. Enjoy :)  &gt;KD's AST/RTO in 6 playoff years at OKC:  KD played 9 seasons and has 9 playoff years. You can't omit those years in GS because it kills your bad argument.   &gt;Kawhi's AST/RTO in 5 playoff years as an All-Star  Kawhi Leonard won a finals MVP 2 years before ever being an all-star. Why are you omitting this data? The fucking time spans aren't even consistent. This a clear case of someone cherry picking data to fit a bad narrative, but let's gon.   KD Career Playoff Assists per game: 4.0  KD Career Playoff Turnovers per game: 3.2  Kawhi Career Playoff Assists per game: 2.7  Kawhi Career Playoff TO per game: 1.8  Kawhi has a better ratio but you have to take that with the context that Kawhi hasn't been the primary decision maker and I'll take the 2 extra assists considering KD's productivity, 6 extra shot attempts per game in the playoffs and the 1% difference in their career playoff turnover ratio.  I'd also like to point out that you took his *all-star* years because that 1.9 assist he averaged in the playoffs while a member of the spurs didn't help your argument to much did it?   &gt;Agreed, but Kawhi is a clearly more efficient than KD who got more inefficient in all years.   He's not especially considering you have two sets of data with inconsistent parameters because it's the only way to fit your narrative. Total Playoff averages below:   KD Career Playoff scoring: 29.1 PPG, TS%: 64.2, FG: 50.4 3P:35.2   Kawhi Leonard Career Playoff Scoring: 20.4 PPG, TS%: 61.4, FG: 50.4 3P:39.9%   Kawhi's higher three point averages are directly tied to 6 less FGA and 2 less 3 point shots attempted in the playoffs. KD also takes more contested shots in the playoffs as well.   &gt;KD's playoff rebounding at OKC: 8.0 rpg  &gt;Kawhi's playoff rebounding as an All-Star: 8.3 rpg  KD's career playoff averages: 7.7 Kawhi Career averages: 7.9  This one was in your fucking favor and you still tried to fudge the numbers even though KD averages more in the regular season, so do with that what you want.   All jokes aside, I don't know how old you are, but your ""Analysis"" would get you fired at my job. Speaking as 24 year  old, higher level data analyst going on five years of experience currently working for one of the largest companies on earth.   The idea you can omit Kawhi's non-allstar years when won a finals MVP before making all-star game is wrong. The idea that you can omit KD's GSW years are wrong. Shit, I didn't even get into regular season numbers which you also omitted, because it shits on your bad argument.   ""Hey I'm going to take this guys best years, remove the other guys best years, not have a consistent time span and think my analysis is valid. ""  Wrong again.   &gt;he was unquestionably Raptors' best/most valuable player &amp; got them over the hump  *Faced an injured warriors team with No Klay, No Kd, and a hurt stephen curry*. That's not exactly over the hump. KD is still a better player.   Your analysis is bad at every level. And you have the nerve to type shit like wrong again."
"I mean, he's been called ""IcyHot"" since he was in San Antonio, so I think that ""sniper"" is a bit of a reductionist way to state how his blazing hot streaks balanced out his frigid ones. I'm not saying he's bad (&gt;40% from three is still great); I'm saying his performance is wildly inconsistent.  I think that, even if a shooter has wonky mechanics, it's fine as long as it's replicable. I already know that some of the greatest shooters of all time like Stephen Curry, Larry Bird, and Reggie Miller have atypical shots. But with Green, it's not just that his shot differs from everyone else's; it's that all of his own shots differ ever so slightly from each other."
Stephen Curry and Lebron James.
"And?  It's not like he doesn't have the ability to hit the shot, you don't just lose your entire ability to shoot, he's in a slump.  Who's to say he won't go 6/6 in game 6?  Would you not pass to Stephen Curry if he was shooting 25% in a finals series? Of course you would.  Guys miss shots all the time."
Stephen curry who????
of course someone on heat turned into stephen fucking curry
It’s against the rules to shoot it with that little time on the clock. Has to be a tip in if there’s 0.3 seconds or left on the clock.  Although there was a sports science awhile back with Stephen Curry that disproved the tule and showed you could shoot it in less than 0.3 seconds.
-Oh... so you went to a team that was 73-9 (season win record) -You blew a 3-1 lead to them in the WCF -First ever unanimous MVP Stephen Curry -As well DPOY Draymond Green - Let’s Not Forget Klay Thompson!!!! -THEY WERE 1 WIN AWAY OF WINNING THE TITLE!!!!! And you tell me you didn’t take the “easy route” SMFH
"u/WheresMyChip  Where’s the evidence that Cavs primarily focused On Steph? I recall after game 3, Cavs focusing more on Durant.....  Outside of two open shots in transition By Durant, Please cite your evidence.  Stephen Curry even Shot 18 more times than KD in the 2018 finals.......how are you guarded more but shoot 18 more times in the finals? u/WheresMyChip   This ‘defensive focus’ on Steph garbage is used to elevate Curry’s performances because KD was just better."
"Needed firepower and defense? My man, have you ever watched Wardell Stephen Curry II? Because what you're saying is just completely undescribable and wrong.  Your argument for Curry not being average is because LeBron was hunting Curry? Of course he hunts Curry because his other options are Kd, Klay, Draymond and Iguodala. Whom all happen to be more than capable defenders... Also, I've watched the 2018 finals, LeBron didn't score that much when he switched on Curry. He genuinely became a better defender. He also performed well on the defensive end during the 2018 WCF against the rockets 1 steal per game and nearly 1 block a game..."
"Isn't the new arena in SF? I think the players would like to live close by and near their practice facilities kind of like Kawhi living right across Staples Center, which is right in DTLA.  Stephen Curry is a family man and extremely religious. He's an anomaly when it comes to NBA players like Klay who apparently lives in a trap house and all the young bucks who enjoy partying and living la vida loca. You think they'd enjoy living in Walnut Creek?  It's one thing to live in DTLA like Kawhi and another to live in Downtown SF."

People love playing with Curry. Only two guys who ever willingly walked away from playing with him (excluding Stephen Jackson a few games into his rookie season) were KD and Patrick McCaw.

Stephen Curry is the worst contract in the NBA
"Wtf is the PPP on a possession where Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant are all open for a 3. Like 2.8? lmao"
where do y’all get this stuff? from the start they said he’d be out at least three months https://global.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27983570/warriors-stephen-curry-undergoes-surgery-least-three-months
"&gt; If he was consistently the best player at his position for a whole decade while other players swapped in and out for best player at their position, then there's a high chance he was the best player in the league then, hmmm? Especially considering NBA had a ton of elite guards during his prime years such as Wade, Iverson, Nash, Kidd, Paul, Deron, etc.  I don't understand the logic here? Other players swapped in and out, as they left their peak and exited but Kobe was never the clear no.1 .   &gt; You know if you pass the ball to a player and he makes a basketball move and then shoots, the player that passed still gets an assist right? Yeah, that's Kobe's career.  What is this even supposed to mean?  &gt; And you're talking about makes. Look at his misses. You answered your own flaw on how statistics is wrong. Kobe wasn't a mediocre 3 point shooter, he just shot way too many shots he should not have shot. Bad shot selection doesn't make you a bad 3 point shooter. If he was a mediocre 3 point shooter, then how can he make an NBA record 12 (at the time)?   Ok, let's say Kobe really was a great 3 point shooter.  (even though he didn't even attempt more 3s than league average for most of his career) You agreed that Kobe took too many bad shots, this reduces his efficiency to a below average one. Purely looking at how it impacts the score, does this make him any different than a mediocre 3 point shooter who has better shot selection but still has the same efficiency? No, you don't get extra credit for tough shots. Kobe may have been a much better 3 pt shooter if his shot selection wasn't bad, but we're here to talk what happened, not hypotheticals.  &gt; And Nash was never the best player in the league, are you kidding me? Lol. He was an exciting player and the best PG in the league but his defense was pedestrian and he had a stacked team at his disposal.   At this point, you've seemed to call out everybody who has a differing opinion for their age. Now I have to ask, were you even alive then? Sure his defense was pedestrian, but what makes up for it is a top 5 offensive peak all time. All of the top 3 offenses ever by rOrtg were led by Nash. Nash did have a strong supporting cast, but it's clear that he could dominate without them, like when he won 57 games in 2006 when Amare missed the whole season. Why on earth would a 2 time MVP not have an argument for the best player in the league?  &gt;  KG never achieved anything in Minnesota so no one is ever going to call him the best player in the league at any point rofl.  KG never achieved anything because of his team. Minnesota was arguably the worst run franchise. Not only were they unable to find solid help for KG, they literally weren't allowed to by the league because of the whole Joe Smith nonsense. Now for 12 years, Garnett waited in Minnesota, and the best help they ever found for him was Latrell Sprewel in the last 2 years of his career. And as KG hit his peak, what did he do? Carried what was literally a 7 win team without him to 58 wins and the WCF, and set the record for highest RAPM in a season. Don't confuse team accomplishments with individual ones.   &gt; Duncan has an argument but in no way is a 20-10 PF ever going to be the best player in the league when there's a Jordan-esque guard averaging 30-5-5. Duncan was never better than Kobe during Kobe's prime years, he was always one of the best players but never the best.   Calling Tim Duncan a 20-10 guy is the most idiotic thing I've heard in my life. The man who anchored the best defense in the league for a whole decade and a half, and you narrow him down to a 20-10 guy. This is why we need some real advanced stats sometimes. Most people don't know how to interpret box score numbers correctly. Duncan's highest BPM in a season is 8.5 and his highest WS/48 is .257. Compare that Kobe's with 7.6 and .224 . This isn't even accounting for the fact that box score stats can't measure defense accurately.   &gt; Take your fake Lakers flair off and put on a Stephen Curry flair or LeBron James flair on because that's who you truly root for.  Suddenly because I don't rate Kobe extremely high I can't be a Laker fan? Being a Laker fan doesn't mean I have to be delusional, I can appreciate Kobe for what he did to our team and not overrate at the same time. In fact if you go through my post history, you'll find a post in r/nbadiscussion where I claimed that Kobe was top 5. Obviously I don't believe that now, but in case you think I hate Kobe, there it is."

"Lol I can see it now.   Curry gets bodied all game, falls on one of his 20 lay up attempts where he always falls. Gets a few his way.   Next stoppage: “Stephen curry, 30, ejected for technical foul”.   Curry with the surprise pika face.   That’s what OP’s plan would get us."

"was gonna mention the same thing.  Not about being below zion but more about being so low.  Jaylen Brown above him.  Like, for real?   And Stephen Curry?  Dude barely played.  Also had Irving voted less because he stopped playing partway through the season."
Meanwhile Stephen Curry the BUM had zero points in this game.
"IMHO they are two completely different shooters in terms of how they throw the ball into the hoop. Purely irrelevant measuring devices but Klay's shot is like a waterfall flowing in reverse and i've never seen someone shoot that perfectly. Ray has a shot that was developed by dribble pull-ups. Tobias Harris has the same kind of shot, because oddly enough they have very similar player styles. Klay's the best shooter ever. Ray is a better Scorer than Klay. Stephen Curry is the most skilled Scorer ever."
"Only PG that is above Steph is Magic. The only players you can argue had more impact on offense than peak Steph are LeBron, MJ and Shaq (IMO 2016 Curry is the greatest offensive season ever).   Stockton is extremely overrated because of his assist and steals records. For one, steals are not a measure for good defense. And his assists are kind of empty stats tbh. For all his incredible assist numbers, Stock never led a top offense in the NBA the way Steph has repetedly done. And his assists are also inflated from him spamming PnR with one of the greatest finishers ever.   And that ""soft"" narrative is so tired lmao. Today's NBA defenses are sooo much better than the 90's. Illegal defense rules would benefit Steph immensely. Imagine not being able to double Stephen fucking Curry off the ball. And imagine letting him cook players 1 on 1 all game. He'd absolutely destroy 90's defenses."
Stephen Curry is a top 3 PG of all time.
That Stephen Curry injury in 16 that he got in the playoffs when he slipped midcourt in Houston was very real and hampered him through the rest of the playoffs. A healthy Curry absolutely would have roasted Kevin Love on that last play and they win the championship because he was struggling that series compared to before the houston game where he was phenomenal
Wardell Stephen Dante Hall Curry
Stephen Curry lol. There weren't really players before him that would jack up 10+ threes per game including 30 footers early in the shot clock.
Stephen Curry lol
"Stephen Curry is more talented than Michael Jordan, and if he played during that era he would be the unanimous GOAT.  The same goes for LeBron.  My top 2 all time is LeBron 1A, Curry 1B, with a massive chasm separating them and MJ, at 3.  MJ benefitted greatly from the illegal defenses during his era, which were extremely favorable for iso scorers. Not to mention the lack of league talent."
"https://www.businessinsider.com/trae-young-impresses-stephen-curry-game-2018-1?amp  https://www.peachtreehoops.com/platform/amp/2020/2/14/21138591/trae-young-2020-nba-rising-stars-highlights-recap-video-atlanta-hawks  Uhhh, I don't think so lol"
Watch Stephen Wardell Curry play
"Stephen Curry is an underrated-good rebounder, mostly because he's got great lower body and core strength and good positional awareness."
"Dame just had high highest efficiency with this ""bad roster"" shooting 40%. Curry has yet to shoot below 40% from the 3pt land for a whole season, and assuming you know his career didn't start in 2014, those teams weren't always good.   For people arguing this by saying ""But the rest of the roster"" instead of the dramatic difference in talent just shouldn't even try. Dame is the 2nd best point guard in the league behind Stephen Curry, and it's a big ass gap."
"I'm here and surprised you didn't put Stephen Curry in 2010s.  Did we ignore about how he 3pt change basketball. his team won 2015, 2017 and 2018"
In every year that KD played on the Warriors he never averaged more PPG in the regular season than Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry and Steve Nash MVPs were undeserved.
"Yeah, but you're discounting the fact that a tired Stephen Curry missed a good look for three when guarded by Love, so that makes Love some kind of clutch defender."
"Atlanta Hawks - Dominique Wilkins   Boston Celtics - Bill Russell   Brooklyn Nets - Jason Kidd   Charlotte Hornets - Alonzo Mourning   Chicago Bulls - Michael Jordan   Cleveland Cavaliers - Lebron James   Dallas Mavericks - Dirk Nowitzki   Denver Nuggets - Carmelo Anthony   Detroit Pistons - Isiah Thomas   Golden State Warriors - Stephen Curry   Houston Rockets - Hakeem Olajuwon   Indiana Pacers - Reggie Miller   Los Angeles Clippers - Chris Paul   Los Angeles Lakers - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   Memphis Grizzlies - Marc Gasol   Miami Heat - Lebron James   Milwaukee Bucks - Oscar Robertson   Minnesota Timberwolves - Kevin Garnett   New Orleans Pelicans - Anthony Davis   New York Knicks - Walt Frazier   Oklahoma City Thunder - Kevin Durant   Orlando Magic - Shaquille O'Neal   Philadelphia 76ers - Julius Erving   Phoenix Suns - Charles Barkley   Portland Trail Blazers - Bill Walton   Sacramento Kings - Chris Webber   San Antonio Spurs - Tim Duncan   Toronto Raptors - Vince Carter   Utah Jazz - John Stockton   Washington Wizards - Wes Unseld     There's a few I could probably be persuaded away from, but I think this is a decent list. I could see Kareem as the Bucks greatest and Magic or Kobe as the Lakers greatest and I know there'll be some DWade lovers. Frazier over Ewing is close, I gave him the edge for winning a championship."
&gt;  Nobody in the current game is really close.  Stephen Curry is still in the game.
"The truth that KD isn’t obligated to make a free agency choice to your liking. I mean, he stayed in OKC for 9 years never asking for a trade and even when he wanted to leave, he never tanked his value or refused to play. He gave them 9 years of great basketball and when his contract was up, he had the right to make that decision, don’t know why you care so much other than the fact our teams played.   Stephen and Klay weren’t lighting the world on fire either, both shooting below there averages and below 40 percent from this point to KD’s injury. But with him shooting at such a high usage and literally any other Warrior not named Curry or Klay was being left open and not making their shots either. KD was Taking really difficult shots weather he was playing with Curry or Klay doesn’t matter as doubles and triples were sent his way and he smoked them all to the tune of 73 TS%"
You are delusional. You’re seriously saying STEPHEN CURRY has more to prove at this point in their careers than Damian Lillard?
"Fantastic way to misunderstand--he was a fringe All-Star player that's on TV a lot now, so everyone hates him RIGHT NOW. Yes: he sucks on TV and his greatest success is sucking enough that we bring him up a lot, increasing his profile.   Doesn't mean that, in 20 years, people are going to look back and think ""gosh that guy that was bad on a cable channel for a few years is the franchise's nemesis"" over the guy that clotheslined fan-favorite-even-if-he-sort-of-sucked Rambis, wasted 12 years of KG's career, did the Joe Smith deal that completely crippled the Wolves for a decade, *then* traded that same KG to his [just-as-classy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-23r2TLNA0) former teammate who happened to be running their old team for literal peanuts, but don't trust me, let's look at the [coverage of the deal](https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2954127):  &gt;Sources nonetheless insist that McHale has had the Celtics at the top of his list from the start, mainly because of his fondness for Jefferson and Minnesota's natural desire to move Garnett out of its conference. But some teams believe McHale's comfort in negotiating with Ainge, and corresponding reluctance to deal with other teams, was another key factor. The former Celtics colleagues remain close and frequently watched games together during the recent NBA Summer League in Las Vegas.  What did the McHale brain trust [do with these picks](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/07/31/robb-a-look-back-at-2007s-kevin-garnett-trade/)?   &gt;Two 2009 first round picks – The Celtics sent the Wolves their own 2009 first round pick and Minnesota’s own 2009 first round pick back to them as the final piece of the Garnett trade. [...]  &gt;That Wolves first round pick ended up being the no. 6 selection in the 2009 draft and the Wolves passed up names like Stephen Curry and DeMar DeRozan and took Syracuse point guard Jonny Flynn instead. Needless to say, a pairing of Flynn and fellow young point guard (the no. 5 overall pick) Ricky Rubio did not work well in Minnesota. Flynn also suffered a hip injury in 2010 that proved to be a major setback for his athleticism.   Sure, the topic is ""player"" but even in the NBA it's hard to find a more emphatic trail of continuous fuck-ups than this guy's post-playing career has been.   Anyway, jfc this sub."
Ah..  I see you’ve never watched Stephen Curry play basketball.
"&gt; no one thinks they were all-nba contributors, but andre really should have gotten sixth man over lou williams and jamal crawford.   dude that's crazy.  &gt; he was the fourth best player on a championship team,   he was not better than steph, klay, dray, barnes, bogut, kd, or looney. you're talking about 2 players who caused a stephen curry team to lose the nba finals to a high school strategy because they can't shoot."
Yeah he helped develop Stephen curry into a 2nd tier star when in reality he an all time great
"Bro fucking stop. Your Laker love is really showing here. Steph Curry is a top 15 player ALL TIME. AD aould be LUCKY to crack top 100. Davis has been nowhere close to being an MVP while Curry has 2. Its not Currys fault that the moment he became a superstar he had other great teamates. I bet your someone who underrates Tim Duncan too. He had Tony and Manu, couldnt have done it by himself.... fucking idiot. Dirk &gt; Kobe. Kobe had all 5 of his rings won with another allstar. Dirk did it by himself hes better! Hey I got a question for you.. you say that AD never made it past the 2nd round, ""just like Curry without another allstar"". How many times did AD make the playoffs before playing 2nd fiddle to Bron? Twice. Who knocked him out those playoffs in easy fashion twice? Stephen Curry."
Weird how ppl are counting out the Stephen Curry
"For the people at work:  Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry said he was brought to tears after he received the news about teammate Klay Thompson’s season-ending Achilles tendon injury last week.  “You feel for a guy who has worked so hard to get back on the court two-three weeks out of [training camp] and something like that happens,” Curry told The Undefeated on Monday. “You need to have a big-picture mentality when something like this happens. It’s easier said than done going through a lot of rehab, but there is a lot of time left in his career. We’re going to be there through it all.”  Thompson, 30, suffered the Achilles injury during a basketball workout in Los Angeles on Nov. 18. The five-time All-Star is expected to make a full recovery and be ready for the 2021-22 season, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported.  Curry learned about Thompson’s injury during a conference call with Warriors general manager Bob Myers and head coach Steve Kerr.  “He’s the best 2-guard in the league,” Curry said. “To get that call was a gut punch for sure. A lot of tears. You don’t really know what to say because a guy like that is having to go through two pretty serious rehabs now. But at the end of the day, we have to have his back. We hope that he is around and a part of what we do through his rehab and staying connected with us.  “He can come back strong. He’s a guy that loves the game so much. He is going to do whatever it takes to get back out there on the floor and be himself. That’s what we hope and the confidence that we have. Two-and-a-half years of rehab is tough for anybody. We’re hoping for the best.”  Curry and Thompson have been teammates since 2011, earning the nickname “The Splash Brothers” and winning three NBA championships together. Curry was looking forward to teaming up again with Thompson, who missed all of last season after tearing the ACL in his left knee during Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals against the Toronto Raptors.  The Warriors are hoping to fill Thompson’s shoes with the recent acquisition of veteran swingman Kelly Oubre, who averaged 18.7 points with the Phoenix Suns last season. In addition, they have agreed to terms with free agent guards Brad Wanamaker and Kent Bazemore.  Golden State also added talent through last week’s NBA draft, selecting former University of Memphis center James Wiseman with the No. 2 pick and Arizona point guard Nico Mannion in the second round.  With the newcomers joining three-time All-Star Draymond Green, 2020 all-NBA rookie team selection Eric Paschall and veteran forward Andrew Wiggins, Curry is confident the Warriors will still be formidable without Thompson.  “It’s going to hard at first, for sure. We’ve been waiting seven months to get back out there,” Curry said. “Not seeing [Thompson] on the court, at first, is going to be weird. But I think we’ve done a really good job in the offseason with James and our draft picks and in the free agency pool to put together a really solid roster. We’re going to have to learn a lot really quickly, and we will need a full commitment from everybody.  “We know we can compete with anyone in the league. It’s kind of crazy. We know how great Klay is. Don’t get me wrong. But we hear the chatter. ‘It’s the end of for us. This year is a wash. What are we going to do in the future?’ But we are in the moment right now. It’s kind of refreshing being in that category as guys that are chasing. We know [the Los Angeles Lakers] are the defending champs. We got to beat them. We’re ready for it.”"
Nike has attempted to discredit Stephen Curry because of his UA contract.
LaDon Wardall Stephen Curry
"Yes, exactly this. There's a [good article on how Nike lost Steph Curry to Under Armour](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15047018/how-nike-lost-stephen-curry-armour) from a few years ago."
"MVP: Stephen Curry, almost a dark horse himself at this point considering he was out most of last season but I think he’ll elevate the Klay-less Warriors to top 3 in the West.  Top 3:  Curry Giannis Doncic  Dark Horse: he won’t win the overall award but I can see Devin Booker entering the conversation considering the supporting cast he now has, particularly if he can continue his form from the bubble."
"Let me preface this by saying that I'm a huge fan of Stephen Curry's game   But I don't see Warriors doing much of anything this year with Curry on the helm, even if I have liked the Warriors' acquisitions a lot, and it's because Curry is relatively ""easy"" to shutdown when he's the only threat on the floor. We saw this with the Warriors at the beginning of last season and at the end of the Raps series.  Granted, Curry had no one around him so he will fare better, but the lack of Klay and the big question mark that today's Draymond Green is, I wouldn't even take the playoffs for granted, though it's more likely that they finish top 5 than outside of the playoffs. With Klay there with this roster I'd have them as one of the biggest favorites to win the championship because how Curry can elevate his and others' game.  Replace Steph with Klay next season and they will be near the bottom."
"The Lakers had Lebron James and Anthony Davis, the warriors have Stephen curry and... Andrew Wiggins"
"Trae young, luka, Russell westbrook love his passion and how he gave a lot of money to disney bubble staff, boban, Stephen curry and klay Thompson."
Stephen Curry looks like a snack  Total WAP Whatever that means
"There are too many haters in the world.   Stephen Curry is still the best point guard and one of the best players in the league. He's still paired with Draymond, who is one of the best defenders in the league and still one of the best facilitating PF's in the league. Oubre and Wiggins are young, athletic and talented, even if they aren't exactly star players.   Wiseman is 7'1"" with a 7'6"" wingspan, fast as hell and even as a rookie if he can give us ~10 minutes a night in a JaVale McGee type rim defense, rim running role that's great out of a 19 year old rookie.   Looney is reportedly full healthy after having surgery on a core muscle and all reports are he looks like his old self in the ""Dubble"" (the training camp they had a while back). Just a couple years ago he was playing big minutes for them in important series and playing well.   Chriss looked amazing with the Dubs the last ~15 or so games, lots of double digit scoring games, several double doubles, I think he's going to earn plenty of minutes this season.  Warriors got another 2nd round steal last draft with Eric Paschal (the Paschanimal!) having a very promising rookie season, winning an all NBA rookie 1st team award. He's a matchup problem on offense, too fast for 4's and too strong for 3's and he's going to do a lot of scoring against second units.   Curry/Oubre/Wiggins/Draymond/Looney/Chriss are all legit NBA talent that can play real minutes in the playoffs.   Wiseman and Paschal will definitely contribute in the regular season and likely have their moments off the bench in the playoffs.   After that you hit the bottom of the roster, ranked in order of what they may contribute next season Damion Lee, Jordan Poole, and if they end up on the roster Mychal Mulder and JTA.   But we also have to keep in mind free agency is not over. The Warriors have not signed anyone using their tax payer MLE, disabled player exception or signed anyone to veteran minimum deals. This roster is still being filled out and will have more talent on it before the season starts.   Steph is what's going to determine their floor but the rest of the roster will determine the ceiling and I like the rest of the roster overall. It's a huge blow to not have Klay nor Klay's cap space but this team is still going to be a winning team."
yeah you right... who knows? Maybe one day back-to-back MVP Stephen Curry can one day join the ranks of true leaders like Tony Parker and Chauncey Billups
"[Like I said](https://www.pbpstats.com/on-off/nba/player?Season=2018-19,2017-18,2016-17,2015-16,2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612744&amp;PlayerId=201939) in the steve kerr era you can look it up for yourself Klay is a 38% 3 point shooter from 2015-19 when Stephen Curry isnt on the court."
He is Marcus Smart when Marcus smart starts thinking he is Stephen curry in the playoffs.
Is one more productive season of Stephen Curry because you traded for Oubre worth 80 million? Yes

"Imagine if Curry and Green listed above are Stephen and Draymond, respectively."
"They didn't really build the team for that, as fun as it might be. This isn't like Houston where Harden had maximum spacing to work with, the Warriors only have Stephen Curry/Damion Lee/Mychal Mulder/Jordan Poole as shooters right now.  They've built the team so that these other guys can be boosted by Curry (and Klay) through his gravity, not for Curry to get big individual stats."
"All-world defenders were leaving Kevin fuckin' Durant open on the break to lunge at *Stephen Curry at the three point line*.  The Warriors have always been Steph's team and KD played within it. That is also partially why he left. He hated that the fanbase didn't see him at the same level as Steph, although I would have argued that if he had stayed, would have gotten close to that same level of adoration. But everyone knows imports never get as much adoration as the homegrown stars, KD is just an odd dude in that way."
"Because he's Stephen Curry. The NBA is a business, but trading Steph for pieces to rebuild around an unproven rookie in Wiseman whose ceiling can EASILY be that of a just role player in a good team is dumb."
"Not MVP level, but I think (Homer lens) he would have got even more assists in today's NBA.  The floor spacing with the value of the 3 point shot would have been tremendous to his game.   Top 5 in Threes made in 1997   * Reggie Miller 229  * Mookie Blaylock 221   * Glen Rice 207  * Mitch Richmond 204  * Tim Hardaway 203  In 2018 Top 5  * James Harden 378  * Stephen Curry 354  * Paul George 292  * Buddy Hield 278  * Kemba Walker 260"
"Are you suggesting for the Warriors to trade the best shooter ever by a fucking mile cause Klay got injured? Let them try again, it’s Stephen Curry and a team that may look good depending on Wiseman and Dray chemistry"
They're going to make him Stephen Curry 2.0 and make all 47 teams regret it haha
Doc loves bringing the family around him next Stephen curry
"If he can throw down a dunk after his man leaves him to double Stephen Curry, without fucking it up half the time, he will be doing more than their centers have since Bogut got injured."
Presti about to offer 35 FRPs for Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry will reach enlightenment and win the championship with Wiggins as his second option.
And that Stephen Curry kid may have lit it up in college but everyone knows those undersized shooting guards just don't make it in the NBA...
I'm not sure if y'all realize how good he was in the bubble.   [He had better stats than Curry from 2015-2019 in the playoffs](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Jamal+Murray&amp;player_id1_select=Jamal+Murray&amp;player_id1=murraja01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;p1yrfrom=2020&amp;p1yrto=2020&amp;player_id2_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id2_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id2=curryst01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;p2yrfrom=2015&amp;p2yrto=2020) I really doubt that he will perform like this for the rest of his career.  But I believe he will have a huge increase in ppg and efficiency compared to previous regular seasons. I think he will average like 22-23 ppg on 58-59ts%
You know who else didn't talk to us? Stephen curry. We drafted 2 pgs before him.
devils advocate Ive heard Stephen Curry talk about how golf is his true love.  I dont think anybody can question his ability to maximize his talent.....but yeah super bad look
"Giannis has had better teams, but the East is better now.   Those players you mentioned... why do you keep bringing up Eric Bledsoe? HE IS A NEGATIVE PLAYER. HE MADE THEM WORSE. Wesley Matthews, DiVincenzo, George Hill will all be replaced. The Bucks still have the MLE. They will find quality players. You’re acting like this is their final roster. Again, ILYASOVA DOESN’T MATTER. He’s washed up. He was salary to make the trade work. He wasn’t getting minutes. How aren’t you getting this.  Jrue (a great player) plus Bogdanovic (a good player, and a great fit) plus whoever they sign with the MLE is FAR superior to Bledsoe (an atrocious player in the playoffs) plus Hill (a fine, but aging and replaceable backup PG) plus DiVincenzo (17 mpg, 6ppg in the playoffs) plus Ilyasova (literally worthless). The Bucks literally had to attach an extra first round pick to get Bledsoe out of town. That’s how bad he is. Depth doesn’t matter in the playoffs. You need 7-8 guys to play big minutes. The Bucks have 5 good-great players and money to spend to fill out the rest.   That statement about Giannis is patently absurd. Do you think if Giannis had Steph Curry and Klay Thompson around him he’d be able to win a championship? Or would teams still be able to “scheme around him.” Has it occurred to you that the reason that teams can scheme around Giannis is because the Bucks have lacked consistent three point shooting to make defenses pay when they pack the paint against Giannis? Do you think it’s “lack of experience” that’s stopping Giannis from scoring in the paint with three defenders draped all over him? Or do you think it’s the three defenders? My bets on the latter. What is this shit about basketball IQ? Are you talking about making the right pass or something? Dude passes out of double and triple teams all the time to wide open shooters and they just brick the shots! Basketball IQ my ass. You’ve bought into the Skip Bayless/Stephen A. Smith cliche bullshit my dude."
No one's denying that Stephen Curry is a very talented player just like no one's denying that the Warriors' ethos won them a lot of games. What we're arguing is that while they were winning and while Steph has cool highlight plays watching the same thing occur to every team where one of the three guys got hot and just railed you from outside got really fucking tedious.
"I just LOVE it when some stiff on Reddit decides that people who get paid to make these judgments and have their writing published on widely-viewed websites lack the credibility they obviously believe THEY have. LOL. ""A Legend in His Own mind,"" I guess.  OK, here's one from Bleacher Report. No Zion, and CP3 makes the top 20, but no Booker (he ranks 27 on this Top 100 List). Suns still not there.  (and again, this one omitted several good players:  Marvin Bagley III (only 334 minutes) DeMarcus Cousins (out for season) Stephen Curry (only 139 minutes) Kevin Durant (out for season) Blake Griffin (seriously hampered by his left knee) Luke Kennard (too few appearances) Victor Oladipo (only 337 minutes) Klay Thompson (out for season) John Wall (out for season))  Here's their Top 20 in reverse order:  20. Kyle Lowry, Toronto Raptors  19. Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets  18. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  17. Pascal Siakam, Toronto Raptors  16. Paul George, Los Angeles Clippers  15. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers  14. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves  13. Chris Paul, Oklahoma City Thunder  12. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers    11. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  10.

Stephen Curry
I’m Stephen A Smith the golden state warriors should trade stephen curry for seth curry
What metric are you using where Stephen Curry is 14th? BMI?
"The Warriors-Spurs series in 2013.   Always knew the Warriors were spunky but they not only made us sweat, it was really a breakout party for Stephen Curry. That Game 1 where he went off for 44 and I felt like I was witnessing something almost transcendent. Like legit in awe of some of the shots Curry pulled off like it was second nature.  And considering how great Klay did, it’s likely that it was the series that convinced Golden State to stick with the Splash Brothers as apparently they were this close to doing a Klay-Kevin Love trade that Minnesota actually was going to say yes to."

Oh how quickly they have forgotten of Wardell Stephen Curry
"Bro when did I say that Jamal Murray is James harden? He’s nowhere near harden right now, and I agree that hardens 2018 run was really good, but when we talk about which run I’m taking, I’m taking the run that overachieved, not the run that underachieved, harden was absolutely miserable in 2018 Game 7    Murray was so effective, and he made history as the first and only person to average those numbers on that kind of efficiency in the playoffs, and his Utah Jazz series was comparable with Jordan numbers man, as a 23 year old player. Stephen Curry wasn’t Stephen Curry at the age, Kobe wasn’t Kobe until his 4th/5th year in the league. Why would you trade Murray after that,   If you watch the Nuggets, then you know that it’s completely dumb to trade away YOUR PRESENT AND FUTURE for a 2 year rental of Harden who’s play style doesn’t even fit them. Murray and MPJ most likely will Blossom into all NBA players, Murray is already on the cusp of that right now and could achieve that next season, and people forget that MPJ could’ve been the number 1 pick if not for his injuries, and he’s been healthy and he’s a deadly scorer. You have to let them develop and grow together like the warriors did with their core.  What YOURE saying is silly. Trading Murray and MPJ would be dumb as hell and that’s why the professional GMs won’t even take a look at that trade."
"“I’m feelin like Stephen Curry, I’m feelin like Stephen Curry, I’m feelin like Stephen Curry, swiiiiish.”  -Stephen Curry by Soulja Boy"
"Bro, no shit people trust woj and shams more, if you're picking the two *far and away* most trusted basketball reporters as your comparison of course the subject will pale. Like, that's like someone asks whether kent bazemore is a servicable nba player and you respond ""there's a reason you'd rather have lebron and steph curry.."" of course, but stephen a still might, and likely does still have some trusted contacts in the league, there's no way he's been in the game this long *strictly* off shock value"
Stephen Curry
Some those comparisons are harsh “poor man Stephen Curry”
"It is not. You are arbitrarily defining point guard. A point guard is a player who plays the point guard position. And Stephen Curry is a better player at the point guard position than Isiah Thomas. He does more to make teammates better, and he's a better scorer."
Stephen Curry currently has 3 wins and 1 loss versus Lebron James in the NBA Finals.
Steve Kerr/Stephen Curry
"Stephen Curry...didn’t see it coming.   Monte Ellis...thought he’d be better.   Jayson Tatum   Wiggins   Antawn Jamison, ended up being a lot better than I thought he would  Kawhi Leonard, I don’t think many people saw him coming. Same with Giannis."
"""Warriors guard Stephen Curry has been fined $50,000 by the NBA after comments made regarding the impending trade of James Harden."""
"Oh gosh, off the top of my head in my opinion...  Stephen Curry Ray Allen Larry Bird Dirk Bill Laimbeer"
"You wouldn't take Stephen Curry with a 40"" vertical 2.0 first overall?"
"Absolutely nailed it. IMO this is why Lebron’s 2016 ring is sooooo overrated. Beating Stephen “playoff brick layer” Curry who turns into Danny fucking Phantom choking on a god damn golf cart every time he’s in the finals proves absolutely nothing lol. I mean should we really expect this “goat” (in reality he’s top five at best and he’s more a sheep than anything hehe) to lose to the first verse in Eminem’s “lose yourself”? (Arms a sweaty, knees weak, palms are heavy, there vomit on his sweater already=Curry’s finals resumé)"

ahh the stephen curry treatment
"This is a great list, you earned my upvote, but at the same time here is the top 10 players in BPM from 2014-2015:  1.	Russell Westbrook • OKC	11.0  2.	Stephen Curry • GSW	9.9  3.	James Harden • HOU	8.4  4.	Chris Paul • LAC	7.5  5.	LeBron James • CLE	7.4  6.	Anthony Davis • NOP	7.1  7.	Kawhi Leonard • SAS	6.1  8.	Rudy Gobert • UTA	5.8  9.	Tim Duncan • SAS	5.5  10.	Damian Lillard • POR	5.1  A lot changes but a lot stays the same."
He needs to pick up that Stephen Curry method and just play on ankle braces.
Zach is just Stephen Curry with a 40 inch vert.
"This is false, James Harden has said to Steph Curry that he actually would rather play team basketball than hero ball/ISO style.  Source:  [https://spacecityscoop.com/2019/02/18/stephen-curry-james-harden-hero-ball/](https://spacecityscoop.com/2019/02/18/stephen-curry-james-harden-hero-ball/)"
Consistency is the only thing stopping Rondo from being better than Stephen Curry
"In terms of which ever team he's most likely to join, I'd put it like this:  1. Milwaukee; Need I explain more? 2. Golden State; Seemingly good friends with Stephen Curry, shares agent with GS player 3. Toronto; Ujiri assisted him and his family in their trip to America, good Greek community 4. Miami; Hard working culture, can offer huge contract, great team foundation 5. Dallas; Can play with Luka Dončić, can offer huge contract, good Greek community"
stephen curry vs. shaq.
"Most games with 30 or more points while playing less than 30 minutes in a single season since the ABA-NBA merger:  7 - Giannis Antetokounmpo, 2019-20 6 - Stephen Curry, 2015-16 5 - Paul Westphal, 1977-78 5 - Freeman Williams, 1980-81 5 - George Gervin, 1981-82"
"Yeah, ball movement is boring. That's why no one likes to watch Stephen Curry and the Warriors. It's just ugly, robotic basketball without any flow.   I miss Tim Duncan, Carmelo Anthony and Greg Ostertag. Those guys had swag."
It’s like Stephen Curry vs Kevin Durant
He needs to stop copying Stephen Curry.
Speaking of Golden State. How bout Stephen Curry? Dude is traaasshhhh.

" In my opinion, these have been the top 10 PGs so far this year (not career wise, strictly this year), and I am excluding Kyrie and Steph, due to them being injured for the majority of the year.   1. Damian Lillard 2. Russell Westbrook 3. Kyle Lowry 4. Trae Young 5. Kemba Walker 6. Chris Paul  7. Ben Simmons  8. Zach Lavine 9. Eric Bledsoe  10. Spencer Dinwiddie   If every PG is healthy:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Damian Lillard 3. Russell Westbrook 4. Kyrie Irving  5. Kyle Lowry 6. Trae Young 7. Kemba Walker 8. Ben Simmons  9. Chris Paul  10. Zach Lavine   I think Fox is a top 11–18ish point guard. He is in a tier with Bledsoe, Murray, Dragic, Conley, Dinwiddie, etc. Not quite top 10 material yet, but he has the potential to be."
"Oh your favorite player is Stephen curry? The steph curry who went 6-19, 4-14 on threes with 4 turnovers including the dumbest behind the back pass I’ve ever seen in my life in a, uh CRUCIAL, game 7 of the 2016 finals? That steph curry? I’m a bit confused.... you dumb fuck."
"Except Steph never shot 45% in a playoff run in his life and in that year shot 43% from the field in the playoffs.  Imagine the lack of basketball knowledge to take Stephen Curry over Kobe freaking Bryant, who happens to be an unquestionable top 10 player ever and the second greatest SG to ever play the game.  By the way, Shaq would average 45 and 20 against the Warriors... You know how i can prove that? he averaged 38 and 17 in a much more physical league in the early 2000s"
"Because Jrue Holiday is the head line guy for the Pelicans. Takes that pressure off BI, Lonzo, and Zion. He's also a guard that comfortably defend 3s. Those are rare.   By your logic, the Kevin Durant Warriors could have offload Stephen Curry for younger assets because ""they're fine without him""."
"Stephen Curry, Russel Westbrook and Markelle Fultz.. just because I invested lots of Reddit comments on that guy so I became kinda obsessed.  A more reasonable answer has Luka as 3rd."
"Bojangles for the win!  On a side note, it's just absurd to look back when Stephen Curry, alone, on more than 11 3-point attempts per game, is making them at a 45% rate."
"This seems like a fun exercise. I'll take a stab at it.  Point Guard.  **(1) Stephen Curry** - He's #1 for now but the last time he balled out as his team's undisputed #1 was four years ago. If he doesn't come back strong, then then his position at the top starts to become contentious.  **(2) Russell Westbrook** - Top 3 playmaker in the league, crazy at pushing the pace, one of the best rebounders in the league, elite kick and drive game, has a history of going off for 40+ points  **(3) CP3** - Has shown he can still deliver if he plays in a team geared to his strengths. However, is injury prone and has lost a step.  **(4) Damian Lillard** - Is the most proven of all the other score-first guards in the league so he's fourth by default.  **(5) Kemba Walker** - Less flashier than Kyrie but is more of a team player and provides more effort on D  **(6) Trae Young** - Only reason I'm not putting him in the top 5 is because the Hawks have been absolute trash. Potentially the greatest offensive guy in this list.  **(7) Kyle Lowry** - Is a reliable floor general who's just all-around good at everything. Doesn't get the respect he deserves tbh.  **(8) Kyrie Irving** - He really showed his limitations on the Celtics last year. He's entertaining as fuck but isn't a great playmaker or a consistent elite scorer yet. I need to see more from him.  **(9) Ben Simmons** - He's fantastic at everything but shooting. Unfortunately, he's the 5th scoring option when everyone's healthy so his opportunities to demonstrate what he can fully do as a top is limited  **(10) Malcom Brogdon** - Is emerging as a top notch floor general too. Great length and can't wait to see him alongside Dipo  Shooting Guard.  **(1) James Harden** - He's a one-man-offence. Pass him the ball and stand on the perimeter is a legit winning strategy. 38ppg is absurd.  **(2) Klay Thompson** - Elite shooter. Top notch defender. Doesn't need to handle the ball. Would start for literally every franchise in the league.  **(3) Luka Doncic** - It's weird. I think he's a better player than Klay but not a better SG lol. His NBA career has gotten off to a great start but his impact against elite teams takes a severe dip and I don't know how he'd perform in the playoffs.   **(4) Devin Booker** - Is in the loaded Western Conference where most of the best guards play so gets a lot of disrespect. However if you use your eyes, it's obvious that he's a supremely talented fella.  **(5) Donovan Mitchell** - His solid defence makes up for the usual efficiency complaints. Has shown an increased playmaking capacity in Conley's absence.  **(6) Bradley Beal** - Considering he's in his 8th season, I don't think he's done enough to be in the top 5. I don't really see why he's a lot of people's #2 either.  **(7) Victor Oladipo** - If he returns to his pre-injury form, then he's basically a top 5 staple. A ball-handling bucket getter who plays great defence.  **(8) Jrue Holiday** - Watching Jrue clamp up a great guard is one of the most exhilarating things in the NBA. He's also good for 20ppg.  **(9) Zach Lavine** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(10) Demar Derozan** - Is the gatekeeper for a top 10 SG imo. Has shown he can handle being a #1 guy but isn't clutch and hasn't developed his 3pt game since leaving Toronto.  Small Forward  **(1) Lebron James** - Kawhi coasts too much in the regular season for him to seriously challenge for this position. Still The King for now.  **(2) Kawhi Leonard** - Incredible two-way guy who is unguardable when hot. His questionable health prevents him from being #1.  **(3) Kevin Durant** - Absurdly good scorer. Can get a bucket in a multitude of ways. But he's third because he's not an elite defender and people who shed their skin once a month are creepy.  **(4) Jimmy Butler** - Jimmy G Buckets. The G stands for Gets. He's a closer, a good on-ball defender and a great team player.  **(5) Paul George** - I think he had a career year in 2019 because Russ decided to defer to him as a top scoring option. He's a streaky guy who's not as good a shot-creator as the top three guys in this list. I think him and Jimmy are very close tbh.  **(6) Khris Middleton** - Isn't marketable. Plays in a small market. Overshadowed by his MVP teammate. Still a good sharpshooting two-way guy who is reliable at what he does.  **(7) Tobias Harris** - When you consider how valuable excellent wings are, then Tobias and Khris' contracts make a lot more sense. These guys are in the tier below some of the greatest players in the league. Tobias is just another good all-around dude.  **(8) Bojan Bogdanovic** - Insanely efficient scorer and has been doing it longer than the guys in the next two positions.  **(9) Brandon Ingram** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(10) Jaylen Brown** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.   Power Forward:  **(1) Giannis Antetokounmpo** - is a force of nature.  **(2) Anthony Davis** - Most obvious #2 in any position lol.  **(3) Pascal Siakam** - Is currently in his breakthrough year but needs to maintain his form against top teams. Will make All-NBA this year.  **(4) Draymond Green** -Is fantastic at everything but scoring.  **(5) LaMarcus Aldridge** - Game is passing him by but he's still delivering.  **(6) Blake Griffin** - was very good last year but he needs to stay healthy  **(7) Kristaps Porzingis** - Ihas been very good this year but he needs to stay healthy.  **(8) Jayson Tatum** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(9) PJ Tucker** -Mr Iron-man. Great defender. Good shooter. Elite-tier role player.  **(10) Marcus Morris** - is currently shooting 47% from three in January. He made my top 10 on that alone lol.   Center:  **(1) Joel Embiid** - Can put up 27/13 while providing DPOY level defence. Can be a monster against anyone not named Gasol.  **(2) Rudy Gobert** - Averages 15 points while being maybe the best defender in the league. It's very close between him and Jokic.  **(3) Nikola Jokic** - Arguably the best playmaking center of all-time. I don't rate him that much on defence though. It's very close between him and Gobert.  **(4) Karl Anthony Towns** -Excellent offensive force but he's a negative defender in one of the most crucial positions. He needs to improve on that front.  **(5) Nikola Vucevic** - Doesn't get the attention he deserves because of small market. He's a 20/10 guy who's a top defender.  **(6) Deandre Ayton** - This kid is a stud but people don't know it yet because he's bad at peeing.  **(7) Bam Adebayo** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(8) Clint Capela** - Kinda how I'd imagine Drummond to play on a good team.  **(9) Andre Drummond** - Has never had a good guard/roster to play with but has managed to impress regardless. I reckon he could take a major leap forward within the right system. I really hopes he goes to the Hawks.   **(10) Josef Nurkic** - Trailblazers fan will @ me if I omit him so Nurkic gets the #10 spot by default. Sorry Sabonis."
"A top 5 point guard this league, due to Kyrie and Steph being injured. He has been a top 20 player this year, in my opinion.  Point guards (this year): 1. Dame- 2. Russ- 3. Lowry 4. Trae 5. Kemba 6.

"After being up three games to one in the National Basketball Association Finals. Prior to the year two thousand and sixteen, no team in National Basketball Association history had ever blown a three games to one lead in the finals. The Golden State Warriors also did this while having the first ever KIA unanimous National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player, Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry, who had become the first player in National Basketball Association history to hit four hundred or more threes in a regular season. Truly mindblowing.  EDIT: Goddammit the thread got deleted as I was typing that up"
"- they were better with adams than with perkins. in what way? in the way of not being a complete liability on both ends. have you ever heard okc fans calling adams the worst starter in the nba or trying to trade him or blaming him for a series loss? no. but with perkins that's what happened  - GSW still had stephen curry and draymond green and iguodala. boogie never went down. klay played for 4.5 games. Lakers had kobe, but no other reliable player because pau was getting punked by KG. bynum and ariza would have provided defense/rim protection because guys like radmanovic and vujacic were getting torched whenever they were on the court. when you have to rely on farmar and vujacic and luke walton as your bench? that's absolutely comparable if not worse  - serious injuries are very common, like I said I just gave you a shit ton of examples. stop ignoring them. a 37 win team making the playoffs? that's not common at all.   - when did I say adams carried anything? I just said he was a better center for okc than perk. don't twist my words. you keep bringing up random shit, you brought up kanter locking up duncan. like what? who tf cares about kanter?  - you changed your argument because first you called okc trash, then you changed to ""werent that good"", so you changed your tune once i said okc had 50 wins and a scoring champ. bottom line: that okc team is one of the best 8th seeds in nba history, there's no way you can call them trash or not good  - yeah because the warriors were an all time stacked team. doesn't mean the clippers weren't a good 8th seed.  - also yeah that's why okc was so great with 2 mvp level players in russ and george. oh wait"
"He's a 31.6% career 3 pt shooter and he's a 32.2% shooter this year.  Whichever criteria you pick, Joel sucks at 3s.  But there is another difference that your ""1 year"" rule doesn't help with.  When somebody who has been a good shooter throughout their career, despite (for whatever reason) having a bad year or part of the year behind the arc, sets up at the 3 point line...they get respect.  It changes a defense.  Stephen Curry shot 24.3% this year from 3.  Do you think his defenders started leaving him to play help defense?  Steph Curry could be 45 years old standing 5 feet behind the 3 point line and still spread a defense.  Joel standing at the 3 point line doesn't spread a defense, which is a huge part of shooting decently from 3, and for big men pulling their rim defending counterparts away from the key, it's the main point.  If Rudy Gobert stays by the basket and let's Joel shoot 30% from 3, who cares?"
"Why are we even conjecturing? KD literally yelled at his agent and asked him why he let him ruin his life by joining GS. Obviously there's some regret if this transpired.  &gt; “I was up at 6 a.m. and he [Durant] calls me and says, ‘Yo, are you up?’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, what’s up?’ And he’s like [yelling], ‘Why the f— did you let me do this to my life?’""  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y"

Counter point: Wardell Stephen Curry
Wardell Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry
Steph is the most dadcore person in the league lmao I would sooner believe Popovich plays video games over Wardell Stephen Curry II
Say what you will about Harden being snubbed but I will duel you to the death if you think he deserved MVP over Stephen Curry.
"He didn’t, but if Stephen Curry was on that Thunder team they aren’t winning a championship."
"“Stephen Curry is the worst in games, he has no time for that. “ -Klay Thompson   Yes this a real quote lol"
"“Stephen Curry is the worst in games, he has no time for that. Although he likes to play and likes the competition, he has no time. “- Klay Thompson"
Fucking Alex Caruso and Tacko Fall lmao    AND Stephen Curry who’s played 4 fucking games hahaha
"Stephen Curry is an awful teammate? Y’dont know basketball.   I know the best season is Grizzlies history was a sweep in the conference finals, that’s gotta be tough. My condolences. But no need to be bitter towards legitimate NBA franchises"
Why are most Warriors fan down on Ben Simmons?  He will be a top 3 player in the league in the Warriors system with Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry.
"""Come play with me, Giannis Antetokounmpo. Do not go play with Victoria Oladeepo. Shoot, I meant to say Victor Oladipo. My bad. Anyway, come play with me, Giannis Antetokounmpo.""  \- Stephen Curry"
Stephen Curry can’t hit step back 3s at James Harden level.   And you even stated why. Look at the amount of attempts. Are these on normal defenders? Bigs? Just how contested are they?   No one can shoot step back 3s on the level of James Harden.
"Dude your team was playing without George Hill against a team missing Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Deangelo Russell and Kevon Looney. I think you might need to reassess the situation."
r/nba will go back to hating the Warriors next year.  PG - Stephen Curry  SG - Klay Thompson  C - Alen Smailagic  PF - Draymond Green  SF - Ben Simmons
Stephen Curry is 31.

So basically 15-16 Stephen Curry
"Tragic that our team mostly sucks besides a few players, and our franchise player has become “injury-prone”  I can’t speak for Kings fans, but passing on Luka Doncic for Marvin Bagley has to feel similar to when we choose Ricky Rubio &amp; Johnny Flynn over Stephen Curry."
"No because he isnt better than Stephen curry, lebron, Luka, harden, joel,jokic, PG. Kawhi,giannis and a few more"
Joe Lacob has entered the chat.  r/nba's biggest nightmare:  PG:  Stephen Curry  SG:  Klay Thompson  C:    Anthony Davis  SF:  Ben Simmons  PF:  Draymond Green  **  Downvote away!!  **
I’m actually surprised Stephen Curry didn’t hit this in 2016
"dude what, i just watched stephen curry be the sole offensive player on a finals team and still give the other team a run for their money. the guy is not human and with some extended time off he is going to come back and light the league on fire"

Shit. Russell Westbrook blows KD completely out of the water here. He dominates everyone not named LeBron in just about every single category. Aside from his abysmal TS%, Russ finishes: 2nd in PER, 1st in OREB%, 2nd best in TRB%, 1st in AST%(by FAR), 1st in STL%, 1st in USG%, 2nd in WS/48, 1st in OBPM, 2nd in DBPM, 2nd in BPM, and 2nd in VORP. In almost EVERY category, Russ is either 1st, or 2nd behind LeBron James. Nobody else even comes close to him in the advanced stats department. Pretty impressive for someone who only pads counting stats at the expense of his team.  &gt;Meanwhile, KD finished: last in PER, 2nd last in TS%, last in ORB%, 3rd in TRB%, last in AST%, last in STL%, tied for 2nd for USG%, last in WS/48, last in OBPM,  2nd last in DBPM, last in BPM, and last in VORP. Hmmm, not what I expected from someone who carried Russ every year. Abysmal showing from KD here.  &gt;So not only was Russ clearly better than KD in terms of counting stats, but he also dominated KD (and everyone else) when looking at their advanced metrics. But of course, stats don't tell the whole story. Let's take a deeper look at each series that year and how both of them performed.  How does this mainly use BPM?"
"&gt;more rings, won a ring without durant, broke the all time wins record without durant, beat durant and then durant needed to join Curry and made another finals without durant in 2019.  Jesus this is some ESPN Stephen A level shit. By most stats comparisons, KD is the better player - he's a better scorer, better defender, has 3x more all-nba first teams, averages 4 more ppg, 3 more rebounds per game, only 2 less assists, 3 more scoring titles, 2 finals MVPs to Stephs 0.  Could you argue Steph is the better player? Sure, he probably had more impact on the game re: legacy, definitely had a better peak season.   But to turn around and say   &gt;saying otherwise makes you a fucking fool  is an absolutely absurd statement. 90% of the stuff you listed are team accomplishments. Let's not forget that for the 3 years they played together, when it counted the most, in the finals, Steph was outclassed by KD."
"What? I definitely don't see best player in the league in him. Perennial All-Star (although he is in the West) maybe but best player - no. Hell, him being an All-Star may not be a given considering how loaded the guard position is in the West from young to established players. You've got James Harden and Stephen Curry as locks whenever healthy. Then you have up and comers like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Luka Dončić, DeAaron Fox, DeAngelo Russell and SGA. Also Russell Westbrook and Damian Lillard exist."
&gt; I grew up idolizing Stephen Curry
"Same thing happened to all budding superstars like Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Lebron James, Jeremy Lin, etc. He'll just have to find ways to adjust the physicality"
Stephen Wardell Curry
"It’s hard. Like extremely hard. You need have the stamina and durability to be that good on both ends. Disqualifying a shit ton just for not having the genes, not counting work ethic to just be an All-Star. Stephen Curry is insanely gifted but even he’s not THAT good.  On top of that it’s luck too. You have to be part of an organization invested in getting you the help you need to make it through the playoffs and hope there isn’t an organization consistently better at that. He may be Michael Jordan but there’s only so much he can do."
"In a straight 1on1 who wins, Ingram or Stephen Curry?  Before you bash me and say Curry will drop 15 on him without even trying, consider that Ingram is a SF that has height and weight advantage. Can't he just body Curry if he gets the ball?"
He seems to have that same likability good person type vibe as Stephen Curry
"&gt; Secondly, Zaza was on the Mavs the year I was talking about when he was 4th in the western frontcourt  OK, you are completely right. My mistake. Excuse me, I don't care about the all star weekend so I don't follow this stuff much but I should have checked before making that point about GSW.   &gt;Also, it makes PERFECT since why Luka is doing better when compared with Spanish born liga stars, he has the combined votes of Spain, Slovenia, and maybe other Balkan countries as well because of his Serbian heritage.  *Again he doesn't have any sizable voting from Spain.   Look, I'll put it as simply as this: Even if just only the Real Madrid supporters who like Doncic's tweets about Real Madrid and his ex-teammates and so forth, would vote for Doncic every day, just those and no other Spaniards, he would pass 2 million votes already.   Drop this idea about there being notable votes from Spain or Europe when Curry is at #4, Irving gets so much votes, Domantas Sabonis (ex-ACB player btw and his dad is a Real Madrid legend too) gets beaten by Alex Caruso handily and Gordon Hayward.   I'd guess more people from LA are voting on this than the entire continent of Europe.   *I didn't say Rubio and Marc Gasol would pass Doncic. So ""Luka doing better than them"" is irrelevant.  But look at the voting. 65k+ votes get players to the list. There are not that many people voting. You think there are many votes from Spain but also that those votes don't go to Rubio and Gasol enough for them to make the list at all. That's quite contradictory, isn't it?  You think there are sizable voting from Serbia yet Stephen Curry makes the list at #4 whilst Bogdan Bogdanovic doesn't and Jokic beats Carmelo fucking Anthony by 18k votes.  &gt;Think about who his fan base is, the youngest and most passionate group of international fans , many of which are nba fans, or probably following him in the nba at the least. They were pissed that he got snubbed in the all-star game last year and are back for revenge.  Are you trying to describe european basketball fans to me?   &gt; the youngest and most passionate group of international fans , many of which are nba fans,   Like is this saying most european basketball fans are nba fans?   &gt;They were pissed that he got snubbed in the all-star game last year and are back for revenge.  Who is ""they"" here?"
I mean it's not nearly as crazy an opinion as you're making it out to be.  Give this article a read:  https://www.si.com/nba/2019/05/29/draymond-green-warriors-raptors-2019-nba-finals-stephen-curry-kevin-durant
"Seth ""Stephen"" Curry."
"it means that because the defense runs to the opposite end of the court, thereby foregoing the offensive rebound, theres no contest for the rebound, thereby resulting in an uncontested defensive board for the player.   the possession was automatic **not** an extra possession, so yeah, kinda a useless stat for the most part--its not something that was particularly hard to work for  edit: and of course, because so many players are jacking up threes throughout a game, that results in long rebounds that depend entirely on your lucky positioning relative to the shooter, not under the rim, so the boards therefore arent something that you fight for like back in the day, but something that if youre lucky youll be rewarded with some fire stats. it's why someone like stephen curry, who doesn't have hops relative to other players, is sucha great rebounding guard: his team jacks up treys, and he's running around everywhere, increasing entropy, increasing likeliness for him to grab the long board and push the fast break"
"Stephen Curry is 4th without playing a single game, and Kyrie is 2nd before Kemba? What exactly are the fans voting for, cuteness?"
Im more surprissed that stephen curry and russell are there lmao
[Steve Kerr says Warriors will play Stephen Curry as soon as he's healthy: 'He's dying to play'](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/steve-kerr-says-warriors-will-play-stephen-curry-as-soon-as-hes-healthy-hes-dying-to-play/)
"&gt;	Stephen Curry is a superstar. Stephen Curry is a really good player. Did I flip flop my argument or can both statements be true?  Every superstar is a really good player... not every really good player is a superstar tho. Calling Kevin love a superstar and using steph curry as the basis of your argument of comparison is hilarious.   &gt;	Lol some players can be still be good when they get older and some can’t, I can’t believe you don’t understand this concept.  You said Kevin love is a superstar. Superstars should be able to be good when they are older. I can’t believe you don’t understand basketball.   &gt;	There’s a reason every player doesn’t a 22-season career like Vince Carter  Lmao this doesn’t even apply to your argument. Comparing a 40+ year old to 31 year old Kevin Love.   &gt;	Lol you’re entire counter argument has been about semantics and technicalities, most of which have been incorrect  How was I incorrect in saying that lebron was the lone all star in 2016? That’s literally a fact. You can’t just make up stuff and try to pass it off as fact. Do your research next time. It’s not hard.   &gt;	you’re not arguing Kyrie and Love weren’t superstars, you’re trying to argue about who got what all star selection in a specific year, not that those players aren’t incredibly talented.  I definitely never argued that Love was a superstar. Because I don’t think he was. You argued he was a superstar and then you flip flopped and changed it to him just being a really good player.   I didn’t say anything of them not being talented. I said lebron was the sole all star in 2016. That’s a fact. You can’t change history like you change your arguments.   &gt;	That’s the kind of argument from someone who DOESNT HAVE any substance in their argument   Nope, that would be someone who changes their argument in the middle of the conversation and expects not to be called out on it. Also it’s someone who tries to change facts and change history. You’re never gonna admit you were wrong about lebron being the sole all star. The irony is hilarious. Do better."
"&gt; Lmao now you’re trying to change your argument. There’s a big difference between “superstar” which is what you originally said, and “really good player” which is what your trying to flip flop too. Nice try tho. At least you acknowledged how flawed your logic was that you tried to sneak in a new argument.  Stephen Curry is a superstar. Stephen Curry is a really good player. Did I flip flop my argument or can both statements be true?  &gt; Chris Bosh was able to adjust his game back once lebron left tho, did he not get older? Shows how little you understand how basketball works.  Lol some players can be still be good when they get older and some can’t, I can’t believe you don’t understand this concept. To the level that you’re actually tryna y’all down to me about a concept you don’t understand. There’s a reason every player doesn’t a 22-season career like Vince Carter  &gt; Aww so you looked it up and got proven wrong again? You saw that lebron was the lone all star in 2016, which is exactly what I said, and now you’re making excuses? Lol common now. I wonder how your going to try to change your argument again just like you did with calling Love a superstar and then changed it to “really good player”.  Lol you’re entire counter argument has been about semantics and technicalities, most of which have been incorrect, rather than the substance of the argument themselves. For example, you’re not arguing Kyrie and Love weren’t superstars, you’re trying to argue about who got what all star selection in a specific year, not that those players aren’t incredibly talented. You’re not arguing that Kevin Love wasn’t the best PF in the league before he joined CLE, you’re arguing about specific wordage and trying to find contradiction in my specific language when there aren’t any.   That’s the kind of argument from someone who DOESNT HAVE any substance in their argument and basically restores to grammar nazism or semantic correctness, which I don’t care about. and is also no fun to argue with, so later, you’re never gonna admit you’re wrong, there’s no point in going on"

"Because in the NBA everyone works ridiculously hard on their shot.  Are you gonna jump to the conclusion that not a single person in this world who shoots basketballs for a living works as hard as Stephen Curry?  I think him being naturally more talented at shooting and then working super hard to make use of that is more plausible than there being every single other professional basketball player that practices shooting for a living and not one of them works as hard as Stephen Curry.  Also have you never ran into that guy that barely plays basketball but still shoots better than a bunch of people that practice way more than them? Talent is a thing man.  Are we also gonna argue that anyone can work as hard as Zion and have a 47"" vertical at 284 pounds? Or that anyone can be a chess grandmaster just be practicing enough? Anyone can be as smart as Albert Einstein just by studying enough? Talent/gifts are a thing."

"ya, thanks, stephen curry   /s"
"Stephen Curry is turning 32 next month and coming off a big surgery. Prime Chris Paul would easily be better than current Stephen Curry. If we're talking prime vs prime, it's a whole different story."
"[He wanted to be a Knick](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2872848-stephen-curry-wanted-knicks-not-warriors-to-pick-him-in-2009-nba-draft), and there's a great [If Then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A02gdSLeyqQ) on this hypothetical."
"This tweet is about Curry’s workout after he gave his interview today:   [During his post-practice shooting routine today, Stephen Curry made 87 out of 100 3-pointers, including 47 of his first 50. Not bad for someone who hasn't played an NBA game since late October.] (https://twitter.com/con_chron/status/1231339283073531904?s=21)"
"I'll link you [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/476lon/whats_a_divisive_topic_in_your_fanbase/d0atcay/) from Nuggets fan u/IdRatherBeLurking  &gt; It started with something seemingly innocent. During our 2013 playoff series against GSW, Andre Igudola decided to pray with Jackson and the Warriors team all series, instead of with our team. That's not something anyone holds against them.   &gt; After Game 5, Mark Jackson stated that [he believed the Nuggets were sending hitmen after Curry.](http://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/05/01/mark-jackson-warriors-nuggets-cheap-shots-dirty-plays-stephen-curry) [This play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w37GUK2uLY) was referenced. Jackson believed that we were playing dirty, not hard. he must have forgot about [this play.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5_JA4-7GrE)  &gt; Mark Jackson insinuated that he had a ""mole"" within the Nuggets team, that was telling him they were targeting Curry. [That mole was clearly identified as Iguodala](http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/12/1/5162790/andre-iguodala-mole-nuggets-warriors-george-karl-playoffs), who went to Golden State that off season.   &gt; To add to everything, Igoudala's cousin sat conveniently behind GSW owner Lacob during the series, [telling him how much Igoudala liked the Warriors organization](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24224429/lacob-iguodalas-cousin-made-it-clear-he-liked-warriors-during-playoffs).   &gt; Because of all this, there's a lot of hate for Iguodala within the Nuggets fanbase.  Basically, that playoff series against GS left a sour taste in their mouth"
"You could say that about every championship. Lebron didn't make Stephen Curry play bad in the 2016 Finals.  Dirk didn't make Lebron play bad in the 2011 Finals.  Come on, man, give credit where it's due. Chauncey won a championship, and Finals MVP.  He is another great point guard that won in the playoffs.  I only brought up the 2005 Finals game 7 to show it wasn't a fluke."
Are you dumb? Do you follow the NBA?   This is the part where you admit you have no fucking clue what you are talking about: https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stephen-curry-player-injuries  I like how you try to attack Embiid like he has anything to do with this.  Hush child.
"It’s a podcast hosted by Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. It’s really good. They had Curry, KD, KG, and Cousins as the last guests. All episodes are free on YouTube"
"Its really good. I never thought Matt Barnes of all people would be a good interviewer but he really allows the guests to speak for the majority of the time. And I think regardless if people like/dislike him and Stephen Jackson for their on court antics, there's a respect there from other nba players. Hes had some great podcasts with Kobe, Curry, KD, Stephen A Smith. I would highly recommend it."
I also remember Raymond Felton^TM blocking Stephen Curry down the stretch too. What a game.
"&gt; Y’all remember when KD shot like 57% TS in OKC and it magically goes up to 65% with GSW  yes, stephen curry is a better shooter than andre roberson and russell westbrook  shocking revelation  &gt;Y’all remember when KD got a wide open dunk in transition cause the Cavs defenders went to guard Steph in transition  oh wow a ONE PLAY sample size lmfaoooooooooo"
You're welcome.  - Stephen Curry

Timberwolves fan here. In the 09 draft We picked  Ricky Rubio at 5 and Jonny Flynn at 6… Stephen Curry was the 7th pick. We also picked Ty Lawson at 18. Jrue Holiday was the 17th pick and Jeff Teague the 18th. Sucks when you miss out on talent like this.
"I remember when Curry [“broke 2K”](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/2/28/11129304/stephen-curry-nba-2k-broken-warriors) because even if you’re a great shooter, you shouldn’t be casually hitting 40ft jumpers. There should be a drop off in accuracy when you hit a certain distance, no matter who you are. Yet.....Curry kept drilling those jumpers at a percentage that couldn’t be quantified in game because if they quantified it, then *every* “great shooter” would be casually hitting those jumpers in game when they actually can’t do it in real life."
ya just like the warriors were a lock for the postseason this year right? i forgot the great stephen curry couldnt lead yall past a 1-4 record to start but those blowouts to the thunder and suns must have been exhilarating. #dubnation.
same thing for stephen curry and then he did the same thing in the nba lmfao. nba GMS are sleeping.
"He should be take out back and killed. Praise be to our lord Stephen Curry, who's gravity keeps us anchored on this earthly abode."
People hate stephen curry. He’s got the most loyal fan base but it seems like the media and a good number of players hate him. I guess they’re not used to watching someone that isn’t an athletic freak of nature drop 30 bombs on them
Stephen Curry
Oh shit!!  OH SHIT!!  Your 2020 Golden State Warriors starting lineup:  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Joel Embiid  Draymond Green  Glen Robinson III
"Sigh. Warriors fan huh ?   Steph Curry TS% went from 60 to 66 in 2017. In terms of on off statistics, both players received a 4-7 jump in their three years together when playing on the floor together.   Stephen Curry had his best playoff performances with Kevin Durant and vice versa. This is why he left."
"Wait, peak Steph was unreliable against tough defenses?   So PEAK Steph, Stephen Curry at his absolute best, peak, pinnacle, apex was at best unreliable. Ok"
"I would go with this line up.   LeBron James, F, Los Angeles Lakers Bam Adebayo, C, Miami Heat Stephen Curry, G, Golden State Warriors Anthony Davis, F, Los Angeles Lakers Andre Drummond, C, Cleveland Cavaliers Kevin Durant, F, Brooklyn Nets Paul George, F, Los Angeles Clippers Draymond Green, F, Golden State Warriors James Harden, G, Houston Rockets Kawhi Leonard, F, Los Angeles Clippers Klay Thompson, G, Golden State Warriors Russell Westbrook, G, Houston Rockets"
Which player would you most want on your team in a NBA finals series?   LeBron James: 45.7%  Kawhi Leonard: 22.9%  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 20%  Kevin Durant: 5.7%  Luka Doncic: 2.9%  Stephen Curry: 2.9%   #washed
&gt;	Which player would you most want on your team in a Finals series?  &gt;	Stephen Curry: 2.9%  https://i.imgur.com/u4L50qN.jpg
Andre Iguodala has more Finals MVP’s than Stephen Curry
"Bro you’re full of shit. Just look at that bulls roster, it’s miles ahead of what the warriors have put out this year.  1	Jimmy Butler 2	Luol Deng 3	Joakim Noah 4	Mike Dunleavy 5	Derrick Rose 6	D.J. Augustin 7	Kirk Hinrich 8	Taj Gibson 9	Carlos Boozer  Those are all NBA players, many of which who can pass, shoot and defend at solid role player levels. Thibodea was also their coach, and got everyone to buy into a defense first game plan. Compare that to the warriors this year    2	D'Angelo Russell 3	Glenn Robinson 4	Draymond Green 5	Alec Burks 6	Stephen Curry 7	Damion Lee 8	Eric Paschall 9	Willie Cauley-Stein 10	Ky Bowman 11	Jordan Poole 12	Marquese Chriss  Russell, Chriss, Stein and paschall are the only players above g-league level that Draymond has played with this year. And all of them are miserable defenders. This is a terrible comparison that I can’t believe was even entertained."

"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2837508-giannis-antetokounmpo-net-worth-breaking-down-salary-shoe-contract-and-more  is it a new contract than this one? cause this one doesn't seem that inspiring. per this article the big dogs make more than 9 mil a year:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779254-stephen-curry-net-worth-breaking-down-his-salary-shoe-contract-and-more   Also, nike will throw 10 mill a year at him to keep someone else from signing him. That is very much in their wheelhouse.   &gt;Considering what Harden ($200 million), Kevin Durant (an estimated $300 million) and LeBron James (possibly more than $1 billion) are making on their shoe deals, does anyone believe Curry's deal is still for only $4 million a year?"
"&gt; “I mean, there’s no debate about it. When Steph’s finished he’s going to be top 10 all-time. If somebody could give me 10 players better than Steph Curry once he finishes his career the way he’s going, then they’re lying to themselves.”  [He also said that about Curry](https://957thegame.radio.com/articles/golden-state-warriors/kendrick-perkins-stephen-curry-top-10-player-all-time).  I think Perk shows potential as a color commentator for games, but he needs to tone down his hot taking BS a lot. He's not the worst hot take in sports talk (fuck you Rob Parker), but he's certainly up there."

"Kawhi will be one of the weirdest First ballot hall of famers because his career stats aren’t that much but he’s still one of 4 superstars of this decade (Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Stephen Curry). He’s a two-time defensive player of the year, two-time finals MVP but he’s only a 4 time all-star, his career stats aren’t has impressive as Kyrie Irving’s or Kemba Walker’s but he’s way more reliable than both of them or Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Really weird but eh, he’s still my favourite player."
Stephen Curry is the reason why the ratings are down
Stephen Curry is even dirtier is 2k.  Whenever I do MyLeague I always try to get him just because he’s so annoying.
Stephen Curry in shambles.

"&gt; as a timberwolves fan: like you said it doesn’t get worse than rubio &amp; flynn , especially when stephen curry jeff teague darren collinson jrue holiday literally any other fucking point guards were available.  The Joe Smith debacle was *way* more atrocious than that draft day decision. Literally lost picks by trying to sign a mid-tier player to a pair of cheap contracts followed by a big payday afterward."
"and i personally think kd's otherworldly scoring ability in one-on-one situations is more valuable in postseason play than anything stephen curry does. there is a reason kd was the one winning finals mvps, not steph. (along with the fact that kd is a better defender, ofc)"

"as a lakers fan: Waiting for kawhi leonard when we should’ve just went after other guys. waiting for darren collinson to sign after the deadline instead of making a trade for someone.  as a timberwolves fan: like you said it doesn’t get worse than rubio &amp; flynn , especially when stephen curry jeff teague darren collinson jrue holiday literally any other fucking point guards were available."
"I think you can just use basketball-reference for this.   Season finder → combined seasons (first to last) → put a minutes limit on it  http://bkref.com/tiny/UJRTC  I went with per 10 minutes just because they don't show more than the tenths digit, you can just divide by 10. Or to fine-tune it more and break the ties you could go per 36 of per 48 minutes.  Looks like with a minimum of 5,000 minutes played, we have:  1. **Michael Jordan** (0.787 points per minute) 2. **Joel Embiid** (0.782 points per minute) 3. **George Gervin** (0.780 points per minute) 4. **Kevin Durant** (0.733 points per minute) 5. **James Harden** (0.730 points per minute) 6. **Freeman Williams** (0.717 points per minute) 7. **LeBron James** (0.704 points per minute) 8. **John Drew** (0.701 points per minute) 9. **Dominique Wilkins** (0.700 points per minute) 10. **Anthony Davis** (0.694 points per minute) 11. **Kobe Bryant** (0.692 points per minute) 12. **David Thompson** (0.691 points per minute) 13. **Jerry West** (0.689 points per minute) 14. **Elgin Baylor** (0.684 points per minute) 15. **Stephen Curry** (0.684 points per minute) 16. **Shaquille O'Neal** (0.682 points per minute) 17. **Bob Pettit** (0.680 points per minute) 18. **Adrian Dantley** (0.679 points per minute) 19. **Walter Davis** (0.676 points per minute) 20. **Alex English** (0.673 points per minute)  Never heard of [Freeman Williams](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willifr01.html) before, crazy he's so far up there. Looks like he came in the league, scored a lot of buckets for two seasons mainly, then trailed off and just barely passed the minutes restriction I put on here."
The black Stephen Curry
"Giannis' Agent: ""And no player has been more loyal to his team than Stephen Curry, so he's heading California to join him!""  Zach Lowe: ""But Udonis Haslem has been with the Heat since 2003... wouldn't he technically be more loyal than Curry?""  Giannis: ""Hmmmm...""  ... and that, boys and girls, is how the Miami Heat won the next three titles. Good night."
"The problem is they do not have clear hierarchy.  Harrell is stat padding for a big contract and doesn't focus on defense.  Lou Williams is a defensive liability and often takes more shot than Kawhi and PG.  This puts a lot of defensive pressure on the two stars.  Add in Paul George health issues, this team is underachieving.  On the bright side, the Raptors looked like they had no chance to ring either until they were about to go down 0-3 to the Bucks, and Van Fleet turned into poorman's Stephen Curry . . .  The talent is there, whether it gels is another story.  But first they need to get healthy before the playoffs."
They're definitely in the discussion for that. Dell Curry-Stephen Curry is definitely worth mentioning
"We vtkwl I beg c00bcv4vgzv 68i &gt;I'm not talking about the actual real life players ([Le'Bryan Nash](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nashle01s5.htjml) or [JamesOnu Curry](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryja01.html).)g &gt; &gt;What if you took the best aspect/skills of the players that make up these names in their primes (for JamesOn Curry - **James** Harden, Lebr**on** James, Stephen **Curry** and for LeBryafn Nash - **c0Le**Bron James, Kobe **Bryan**t, Steve **Nash**). k &gt; &gt;Which fusion of these players would be better?"
Klay Thompson.   Stephen curry.  They can drive (esp curry) but the bulk of their points are from jumpers.       You don’t have to finish inside to be elite necessarily.     Most guys also don’t shoot the way those 2 do.   Guys who stick around in this league a long time change their game when their body changes due to age.
So this is the power of Stephen Curry.
"I mean, he just wasn't even the favorite for MVP at this time of the year. He was 3rd or worse in about every odds ranking you can find from january/february last year:  [7th in this sports book](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-mvp-odds-picks-vegas-legend-fading-giannis-antetokounmpo-backing-stephen-curry/)   [ behind Giannis and Harden here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2813894-2019-nba-mvp-odds-james-harden-favorite-after-dropping-44-on-warriors)  [9th from this casino] (https://www.fanduel.com/theduel/posts/6271941-james-harden-s-57-point-game-has-mvp-odds-skyrocketing)  if you can find me any actual odds that even had PG as the favorite, let alone a *lock* I'll be extremely surprised"

Show me on the list of NBA teams where Stephen Curry hurt you
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson (alternate: Chris Mullin), Rick Barry, Kevin Durant, Wilt Chamberlain"
"PG: Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II SG: Klay Alexander Thompson SF: Kevin Wayne Durant PF: Draymond Jamal Green Sr. C: Wilton Norman Chamberlain"
"1v1 comparisons are dumb, imagine Hakeem Olajuwon vs Stephen Curry. One dominates the other in their respective skills."
"FMVP is much harder, just ask Stephen Wardell Curry."
"""Stephen Curry will be re-evaluated during the offseason"""
But he’s the next Stephen Curry.
"Y’all laughing but this was a real story. Steph finally got contacts and immediately improved shooting.   &gt; “I started wearing contacts,” Curry told Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic. “No, I’m serious. It’s like the whole world has opened up.”  &gt; The sharpshooter says he's always had issues with his eyes, but he was able to overcome those difficulties.   &gt; “I had gotten so used to squinting for so long,” Curry added. “It was just normal.”  http://www.nba.com/article/2019/04/03/stephen-curry-contact-lenses-shooting-slump"
??? His true shooting is literally below average (by -2%) - that means every offensive possession CJ finishes is below league average efficiency.   And the context is his running mate has the gravity of Stephen curry and James Harden so he should be more efficient.
"Giannis is tied for 4th in NBA endorsement dollars at $20 mil for 2019-2020 (active players), he’s gonna do fine with endorsements regardless of which team he is on.  I combined the data from two recent Forbes articles about [top 10 highest paid players for 2019-2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/10/23/the-nbas-highest-paid-players-2019-20-lebron-james-scores-record-92-million/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=2763997863&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrSportsMoneyTwitter#223fcf8bdae6)  (salary+endorsements), and another on [top shoe contracts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/08/28/the-nbas-richest-shoe-deals-lebron-kobe-and-durant-are-still-no-match-for-michael-jordan/#76ff41b03d02), stripped out salary and reordered to get an approximation of how Giannis ranks. (This list doesn't not completely represent endorsement dollars, as the first article combines salary, so some older players who's salary has dipped and still have big endorsements might technically make the list, such as Derrick Rose who makes $11m from shoes).  &amp;#x200B;  1. LeBron James, $55 million ($32m shoes) 2. Stephen Curry, $45 million ($20m shoes) 3. Kevin Durant, $35 million ($26m shoes) 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo, $20 million ($10m shoes) 5. Kyrie Irving, $20 million ($11m shoes) 6. Russell Westbrook, $18 million ($12m shoes) 7. James Harden, $17 million ($14m shoes) 8. Klay Thompson, $15 million ($9m shoes) 9. Damian Lillard, $14 million ($10m shoes) 10. Zion Williamson, $13 million (full amount unknown, only shoes)"
"FVV transformed from g-league player into poorman's Stephen Curry in the middle of the playoffs.  And it seems like this transformation is permanent.  It was completely unreal and major props to the coach for sticking with him for so many bad games.   With hobbled Kawhi, they don't ring if FVV didn't turn into a star player."
"Trae is not arguably the best playmaker of a group that includes Stephen Curry and Chris Paul, stop it."
"If you go back in time and stop Stephen Curry, Ray Allen and Reggie Miller from being born then yeah Duncan Robinson has a shot"
"Yes, I have a dream that one day Stephen Curry will punish me for not bringing the books I borrowed, back in time."
"I wasn't lionizing Wade as way of saying he's better than Simmons although he was. I was trying to explain that Wade's greatness was **in spite** of his poor perimeter shooting. No one should aspire to shoot from outside like Wade. It's like aspiring to dunk like Stephen Curry.   Like go look at Wade's shooting by distance. Even in his prime, his shooting from 10-16 feet was only like 40%. A 40% 2pt shooter is as efficient as a 27% 3pt shooter."

Wardell Stephen Curry
"#Giannis Antetokounmpo is being marketed to overtake LeBron James as the NBA’s most famous player. But the ‘Greek Freak’ is more focused on the ‘essence’ of basketball.    Giannis Antetokounmpo could probably drive your SUV from the back seat. He might be able to simultaneously open your fridge and microwave. He can definitely touch the rim without leaving his feet.    The “Greek Freak” has a wingspan of 7 feet, 3 inches.    And yet those in his corner want to expand his reach.    “We want to be the world’s team,” Bucks president Peter Feigin said, “led by the world’s player.”    The basketball world will descend upon Chicago for NBA All-Star Weekend. There will be parties, promotional events, hospital visits, media sessions, a skills challenge, a slam dunk contest, a 3-point shooting extravaganza and even an actual All-Star Game.    Antetokounmpo could do without all of it … expect for the game.    He is so serious about basketball — even a defense-optional exhibition that doesn’t count in the standings — he debated conducting his pregame routine in Milwaukee before a drive down I-94 to the United Center.    “We had serious discussions,” agent Alex Saratsis said.    Antetokounmpo only relented once Saratsis, a Northwestern alumnus and Lincoln Park resident, promised he’d secure a quality gym in Chicago for Antetokounmpo’s Sunday afternoon sweat.    “And then he will go and play hard,” Saratsis said, “to the point where teammates have told him: Chill out.”    Antetokounmpo is so serious about basketball, he didn’t sound entirely thrilled about having received the most fan votes (more than 5.9 million) among Eastern Conference players. That tally made him team captain for the second straight year, requiring him to draft players.    “If I’m the captain, I’m the captain,” he said. “But by being the captain, you have more things to do and it takes away from the game. I don’t like things that take away from the game.”    And therein lies the conundrum for those pushing Antetokounmpo to overtake LeBron James as the sport’s most famous player: What if he doesn’t want to be the face of the NBA? Or he’s simply ambivalent?    “In five years he might say: I make ‘X’ amount from the Bucks, I make ‘Y’ amount from Nike; I’m good,” Saratsis said. “How much money does anyone need in a lifetime? For him it’s not about being a power broker. He doesn’t want a production company. He cares about family, people close to him and basketball.”  The Bucks (45-7 heading into Monday night’s game in Sacramento) have lost only once since Jan. 8. They held off the Celtics on a 40-point night from Kemba Walker. They beat the Bulls as Antetokounmpo scored his 10,000th career point and enjoyed his 18th career triple double (28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists). They beat the Hornets in Paris.    Seven days later they were back home at Fiserv Forum, the glistening House That Giannis Built, for a special occasion: Greek Night.    The Bucks distributed a bobblehead of Giannis and teammate Thanasis Antetokounmpo, the older brother Giannis hugged moments after the Bucks made him the 15th pick in the 2013 NBA draft. Thanasis wears 43 to mirror Giannis’ 34 jersey.    Coach Mike Budenholzer gave Thanasis his only start of the season, and he scored 62 seconds after the opening tip on a breakaway slam. He laid one in off a Giannis feed to give Milwaukee a 13-4 lead. The Bucks’ bench and sellout crowd went nuts.    But long story short, the Nuggets shot 22 of 46 (47.8%) on 3-pointers and stunned the Bucks 127-115. It made for a quiet scene in the Bucks locker room, a Friday night that felt more like a Monday morning.    Peppering Antetokounmpo with non-basketball questions seemed even sillier than usual.    Asked how he has adjusted to the spotlight, the NBA’s reigning MVP replied: “To be honest I try not to think about it. I know my name might be out there, but I’ve never cared about that and don’t now.”     Told of Giannis’ comment that the captain’s duties might detract from his play during the All-Star Game, Thanasis understood. Of course he did.    The brothers are so attached that when Saratsis presented them with two hotel room keys shortly after Giannis was drafted, they looked at him quizzically. They explained that they had never slept in separate rooms. Even adjoining hotel rooms didn’t provide enough closeness.    “(Giannis) is all about the essence,” Thanasis said. “How he practices will translate to the game.”    Though Antetokounmpo doesn’t seek fame, it finds him. He has the NBA’s second most popular jersey after James and ahead of Stephen Curry. He has more than 7.2 million Instagram followers, which ranks 11th in the NBA and first among international players.    Although Antetokounmpo plays in one of the NBA’s five smallest markets, Feigin said he could make the case that the 6-11 forward is actually the league’s most famous player.  Where else other than Greece?    “If you did a survey in Paris,” the Bucks’ executive replied cleverly, “he might win.”    Saratsis, his agent, said that given that Antetokounmpo’s parents are Nigerian, he “touches two continents. Europe has a massive immigrant population, and his story resonates with so many people. He has blazed a new trail with fans that are immigrants and have multinational parents.”    Antetokounmpo, 25, partnered with Nike in 2017 and last year became the first European-born player to have a signature Nike shoe — the Zoom Freak 1.    Don’t expect to see him doing ads for Binny’s or Majestic Star Casino while he’s in Chicago this weekend.    “We look at it as quality over quantity,” Feigin said. “What are the right spots? We want to market him as a global brand. It’s not ubiquity, it’s not everywhere, anyway, anyhow. How do we make things special?”    Antetokounmpo is scheduled to appear at Water Tower Place at 3 p.m. Saturday for a panel discussion with hip-hop artist Swoope, a fellow JBL ambassador. They will explore the intersection of basketball and music.    On Sunday he’ll be the focal point of Team Giannis, a captain who selected Walker, Joel Embiid, Pascal Siakam and Trae Young to round out his starting five. Last year Team Giannis lost 178-164 despite his game-high 38 points in 27 minutes.    Then he will return to his comfort zone of Milwaukee, a bright light in a city without all that many.    “I think he really enjoys life here,” veteran wing Kyle Korver said. “I don’t think he’s doing this well because he’s in a small market. I think he could flourish anywhere. But with his upbringing and how he thinks, he wants to keep the main things the main things — his family and the game.”    Teddy Greenstein   Note: fuck the censors."

Regardless I really want to see the starting 5 of Curry, Bron, Whi, KD and AD share the floor together."
“Stephen curry”
"There's a difference between Butler/Kat/+1 and Curry/Klay/Draymond as teammates.  The former are two b-list (at best) stars who aren't great offball, don't create as much spacing, didn't literally create the modern nba, and haven't won anything.  It's also important to note that on that 17-18 team Butler and Wiggins were 2a and 2b.  They had nearly the exact same usage rate and fga.    The Warriors system is far better than anything that the Timberwolves have ran in their entire history of Wiggins.  The bottom line is that there is little to no similarity between the 2017-18 situation and this with the Warriors.  Kerr is a far better coach.  Steph is a far better player.    Wiggins is in a role where he isn't asked to do too much.  I'm in no way saying Wiggins is going to do well.  It's just silly to compare playing for the trash Twolves and KAT/Jimmy who seemingly didn't even like him to playing with one of the greatest teammates ever in Stephen Curry and the Warriors."
"But if you have other guys at that same position that hampers development, is it really the better option? Ignoring Stephen Curry, the Wolves tried this with Flynn-Rubio and look at what happened.  If Charlotte had picked Damian Lillard a year after selecting Kemba and tried to develop both, would either have become the players they are now?"
"Dude, put down the bong. Lowry is a good player. Top 6-10 at this time probably. But just compared to the 2 guys you mention (Steph and Kyrie) he’s a distant 3rd in [every measurable stat](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kyle+Lowry&amp;player_id2_select=Kyle+Lowry&amp;player_id2=lowryky01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Kyrie+Irving&amp;player_id3_select=Kyrie+Irving&amp;player_id3=irvinky01&amp;idx=players)."

Stephen Curry - The Puny Curser
"Kawhi has never won MVP, Giannis will have 2 by the end of the season. That ties him with Bob Pettit, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry. He's only 2 away from LeBron James and Wilt Chamberlain. If he wins 4 MVPs he's in the GOAT conversation by default. He'll get some rings eventually, they all do, even if he decides he needs to jump teams to do it like LeBron and Durant."
"G: Stephen Curry - D'Angelo Russell  G: Klay Thompson - Monta Ellis  F: Kevin Durant - Andre Iguodala  F: Draymond Green - David Lee  C: DeMarcus Cousins - Jermaine O'Neal  Other notable players: Andrew Bogut, Andrew Wiggins, Shaun Livingston, Nate Robinson, Harrison Barnes"
**Realistic Tall Ball:** 🏀   PG: Damion Lee (6’5”) SG: Klay Thompson (6’6”) SF Wiggins (6’7”) PF: Looney (6’9”) C: Maqueese Chriss (6’9”) —* or Smailagic who’s 6’10 but works better with Chriss *  **Realistic Small Ball**: 🏀   PG: Ky Bowman ( 6’1”) SG: Stephen Curry (6’3”) SG: Jordan Poole ( 6’4”) PF: Paschall (6’6”) C: Draymond Green (6’6”)  Just depends on the team your playing but realistically your not putting Steph at SG in this line up etc; but it would work
"When I wrote this sentence, I really just meant it in a way that Trae Young is pushing the average distance of a three point shot deeper and deeper.   He is really shooting in from way further distances then Steph. But there isn't and probably won't be a better shooter in a while than Wardell Stephen Curry."
I'd be happy to die as long as I get to play with Lebron James and James Harden and Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and Kemba Walker and Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic and Damian Lillard and Russel Westbrook and Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry and Jaylen Brown and Jimmy Butler and Kendrick Nunn and Bam Adebayo and Domantas Sabonis and Derrick Rose and Paul George and Chris Paul and Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell and Ja Morant and Eric Gordon and Robert Covington and PJ Tucker and Zion Williamson and Lonzo Ball.  But most of all I'd love to play with Giannis Antauodakumpereee. He's my favorite player.

Until this young man named Stephen Curry came into the league and became the best 3P shooter of all time with the finesse to dribble anywhere on the court with ease with unbelievable passing and finishing around the basket.

Lebron James  Chris Paul  Healthy John Wall  Luka Doncic  Russell Westbrook  Trae Young  Nikola Jokic  Stephen Curry  Ben Simmons  James Harden
"Wardell comes from their dad, Wardell Stephen ""Dell"" Curry I. I can't find where it's from from there though  Adham I have no idea about either tbh  I also don't know when Steph started to use his middle name, either. I'd be curious about that. And also when he started shortening it (the announcers and media still often use Stephen for him too, of course)"
"I mean, it's Wardell Stephen Curry and Seth Adham Curry, so they aren't that weird tbh"
Dude how far was that? Stephen curry of the 40s?
If Steve Kerr married Stephen Curry his name would be Steve Curry.
Stephen Curry is a class act
People don’t get that. It’s like calling Stephen Curry trash for missing 60% of his 3 point attempts.
This is the ranking I could find [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/12/sports/basketball/stephen-curry-warriors-popcorn.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/12/sports/basketball/stephen-curry-warriors-popcorn.html)  Is there an updated one because the Wizards are around the middle
"From the article:  ""According to Article XXXIX, Section 5 in the CB, players lose 1/92.6 of their salary for every game missed as a result of a Force Majeure Event (""FME"") -- this refers to events or conditions that makes it impossible for the NBA to perform its obligation under the CBA.""  Essentially, that's roughly 1.08% of the salary per game... which, really isn't much in the long term. Let's use Stephen Curry as the example.  Steph makes $40,231,758 this season; that's roughly $490,631 per game.  The Warriors have 17 games left in their schedule, meaning Steph would be paid $8,340,727 over those final 17 games.  1/92th of $8,340,727 is... $90,660, about $10,000 less than Kevin Love just ensured to help the Cavs arena workers get paid.  It's not a big loss at all for these guys."
*Wardell Stephen Curry has been randomly coronavirus tested*
"Time will be kinder on his legacy. Hell look at this year people have already started to mentally learned to separate the OG Warriors from KD and are starting to realize the OG Warriors weren’t responsible for the unfairness of the KD Warriors and their accomplishments still count because they were here before KD. The whole 5 year run blurs together that’s why the word “dynasty” and the sentence “3 championships in 5 years” have started to become more prevalent.   Steph was here for all of it. People will know that. History books will adore Lebron James, and they will also be kind on his greatest adversary: Stephen Curry."
Damn bro I remember all the defenders who tightly followed Kobe Bryant from 30 feet out like he was Stephen Curry
I'd easily pick the guy who is having the best 3 point shooting season by a player not named Stephen Curry. There's lots of players who can do what Wes does. Robinson is the kind of guy that can get hot in a playoff game and hit 4 threes in a quarter to will a team to a win.
1. Stephen Curry  2. Klay Thompson  3. Victor Oladipo  4. Trae Young  5. Ja Morant  6. Kyrie Irving  7. Bam Adebayo  8. Draymond Green  9. Patrick Beverly(Purely for the antics)  10. Zion Williamson
Stephen Curry is a Golden State Warrior. And I’m a Knicks fan
"&amp;#x200B;  \[Dan Feldman\] ""I wonder what Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry think of Lacob's comments. Durant took a discount with Golden state that, rather than just open team-building mechanisms, transferred money to owenrship. Lacob reportedly considered offering Curry less than his full max - which again would have left more money with ownership rather than help with team building. And now Lacob is bragging about how much money the team makes?"""
STEPHEN CURRY NOOOOOOOOOOO WHAT DID YOU DOOOOOOOOOOOOO? ;(
"Lots.  First, after missing time due to a calf injury, Kevin Durant returned during the Finals and tore his Achilles tendon. That ruled him out for this season. Durant would then sign with the Brooklyn Nets in the offseason.  The following game, Klay Thompson looked to extend the series but tore his ACL after a botched landing.  So the Warriors are now down two of their stars, with one even leaving altogether. That still leaves two time MVP Stephen Curry and former DPoY Draymond Green. However, Curry injures his hand four games into the season, and the resultant surgery sidelined him for months.  With the Warriors lacking in star power and an inexperienced bench they've thus been one of the worst teams in the NBA."
Stephen Corono Curry
"Wait. You’re telling me inconsistent consistent cold spell can’t dribble in traffic Klay has a bigger positive effect on Stephen Curry, than Stephen has on Klay? Curry is basically the floor general icon personified"
Everyone is asking who Pablo is.... who the hell is Stephen Curry?

Looking like 2016 Finals Stephen Curry.
"Mate, you shitpost a lot.

"I'm saying you've got no evidence of an improvement. With no evidence, you default to what they were considered before the change.  The Warriors *do* have evidence that things aren't even close to as bad as they seem. Their names are Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green - and all of them will be back to playing regularly next season.  You need to work on your logic more - rhetorical questions are only effective if there's really only one answer."
"&gt;A large part of why steph became an mvp was because kerr gave him the keys to the offense and allowed him to shoot anywhere on the court. Do you think the thunder and westbrook would have let curry do that?   when you can shoot like Steph Curry, yes. Of course. He shot 45% from 3PT range when Mark Jackson was coach and Monta Ellis was the star, what reasonable coach would tell someone who shoots like Steph to shoot less? You said you lost all opportunity to have a rational conversation, but I guess that was me. I can't believe I actually have to explain to someone that a 3PT shot for a 45% 3PT shooter (2nd best in NBA HISTORY) is a good shot and there isnt a single coach on the planet would stop the best shooter in NBA history from shooting 3s  Even you're dumb enough to actually think Stephen Curry would be a bench player on any team, of course you're gonna be dumb enough to think KD is better than Curry, so there's really no point in conversing anymore"
Stephen Curry
"* Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Shaq * Tim Duncan * Bill Russell * Kobe Bryant * Wilt Chamberlain * Stephen Curry * Hakeem Olajuwon * Kevin Garnett * Kevin Durant * Dirk * Jerry West * Chuck * Wade  off the top of my head, these players are/were all better than Isiah Thomas"
"Man, speaking of Steph, I've needed to say this to someone who will understand and I think now is my chance: yes, Steph Curry will make more threes than anyone in history, but Steve Kerr is the greatest three point shooter of all time. As far as a percentage goes, Steve actually does top the career leader board - he shot .454 from three over the course of his regular seasons. The fact that he has produced Stephen Curry at #6 all time - and Steph's brother Seth, who takes just after him, is #2 all time - and Klay Thompson at #14 all time, shows that Steve's mastery of the three point shot is truly unparalleled by none.    The end."
Stephen Curry will be ranked higher all time than Kevin Durant when it's all said and done.
"Stephen Curry was drafted in 2009 by the warriors and didnt win a championship until 5 years later in 14-15.  People forget that the core of the warriors (Curry, Klay, Draymond) won a championship and followed that with the best regular season ever before Kevin Durant joined.  They were also all drafted by the organization"
"If you're gonna ignore context Stephen curry is 3-1 vs LeBron in the finals   How can he be the goat, l o l  Curry also has the same amount of rings in less attempts  What makes LeBron better I just don't see it ????"

"Bill Russell: Sadly, his influence was not sufficiently recognized for many years during his career, leading to the doomsaying after Cousy retired and Russell's distaste for Boston from that and the racially-motivated criticism he received from his home crowd and newspapers. The man was the first black head coach (while he was a player) and a prominent sportsman in the push for civil rights.  Oscar Robertson, who in addition to being a generational superstar of whom there is sadly a dearth of public game tape because he was on the lowly Royals for most of his career, sued the NBA to create the free agency system eight years after he first filed suit. I would argue he and his counterparts in other major sports (Curt Flood in the MLB, the players that sued the NFL to end the Rozelle Rule in the 70s and Plan B in 1992, Kingaby and Bosman in soccer, etc.) have had the biggest impact on the operations and culture surrounding their respective sports.  Michael Jordan: He permanently and almost single-handedly changed how the marketing of athletes works, and in doing so, made it possible for big name free agents to use marketing deals and sponsorships as a significant enough part of their income to affect what market they choose to play in. First, he became a hugely successful commercial pitch man for the world's biggest non-sports brands and spurred Nike far past its competitors. Then he became the model for building a personal brand centered around an athlete's image and charisma. Nobody has ever gotten as big as MJ since then, relative to the available audience pool. The creation of income streams off outside of a player's salary has been the largest financial shift for today's stars, and helps determine their choice of markets and teammates.  Stephen Curry: This is the only player whose influence is strictly on the court. Curry the man is not interesting beyond his really cute kids' podium antics and the time period that he just suddenly had an AAVE accent in his early teens. On the court, he verified to doubters that a player with sufficient shooting skill is just as difficult to defend against as a dominant low post scorer or elite scoring wing (except for Charles Barkley, who is mad that Matt Maloney shot the Rockets out of the '97 playoffs by going 0-6 from 3 in game 6 vs. the Jazz and has hated threes ever since). The 3-point explosion has had an effect on basketball very similar to Gus Dorais and Knute Rockne popularizing the forward pass in football in the 1910s; what was formerly a gimmick, specialty, or desperation move became a significant part of the sport's offense. The game opens up and the role of offense becomes more impactful than defense. I hope that Steph will get a rule change named after him when the NBA moves the 3-point line back someday, even if it's after he has retired.  If I were to extend this to a starting 5 instead of a Mt. Rushmore, I'd easily choose Elgin Baylor. While simultaneously proving that a black man could be the star of an integrated basketball team in a white market (Minneapolis) and a major city (LA), he showed an exciting and athletic style of play that defined the role of the scoring forward to this day. Go on YouTube and watch some of his fellow high-scoring small forwards from that era: Jack Twyman, Cliff Hagan, Paul Arizin, George Yardley. All Hall of Famers. They look like they're wearing cement shoes compared to Elgin as he hops over Cliff Hagan and Bob Pettit for rebounds in the 1959 West Finals. Cited by Dr. J and Kareem as major inspirations."
"Here’s mine in no particular order, but the first few are some “Legacy” players since I think it’s important to include the non modern day players that didn’t make the original list.  - Dominique Wilkins - Bob McAdoo - Adrian Dantley - Alex English  - Gary Payton - Jason Kidd - Kobe Bryant - Tim Duncan - Kevin Garnett - Dirk Nowitzki - Allen Iverson - LeBron James - Steve Nash - Dwayne Wade - Stephen Curry - Kevin Durant - Russell Westbrook - James Harden - Chris Paul - Kahwi Leonard - Dwight Howard - Tracy McGrady - Ray Allen - Anthony Davis - Carmelo Anthony  If the first four weren’t added (since they didn’t make the original but I think it’s whack that Dominique/McAdoo didn’t get in for 50) then I could also see some high profile names like Dennis Rodman, Yao Ming, Deron Williams, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Manu Ginobli, Kyrie Irving... I think though it’s really hard to remove any of the modern day players listed above (post-1997) when your factor in MVP’s, 1st Team All Pros/Defense, Titles, Stats...   I could definitely see Giannis getting in as the “Shaq” pick of the 75th Greatest Players list (Shaq got in the 50th Anniversary Team when many felt he did not deserve it yet as he had only been in the league 5 years at the time)."
"Steph actually does.  I'm more interested in what they actually do than what their skills theoretically allow them to do, after all if KD's ability to score/create against any player in the league at will is more important than Steph's skills we should see that ability reflected in their data.  Offensive impact can basically be broken down into the impact from your own scoring and helping your teammates score.  They're pretty much equal on scoring, and Steph has a significant edge in helping his teammates score.    Scoring is all about how many points you can score and how many possessions you use to score those points.  They're pretty much equals here, over their careers Steph averages 23.5 points on 18.8 true shot attempts (best easily calculable measure of possessions used)while KD averages 27.0 points on 22.1 TSA per game.  So KD is giving you 3.5 more points on 3.2 more possessions, a TS of 55.1% - pretty much league.  So most teams should be pretty much indifferent between the 3.5 more points KD gives and the 3.2 additional possessions he uses to get those points.    On the other hand, Steph is consistently one of the best in the league at improving his teammates' efficiency, and KD can't say the same.  Unfortunately it's harder to get the stats on this, so I don't have as comprehensive a breakdown as for scoring, but there are some articles and graphs that float around which demonstrate the gap and show how Steph is one of the best playmakers in the league.    See for example [this graph](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,f_auto,h_912,w_672/https%3A%2F%2Ffansided.com%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F03%2F04-Curry-PG-Teammate-TS.jpg) and [this graph] (https://fansided.com/files/2018/03/05-Curry-PG-Teammate-TS-vs-TS.jpg) in [this article](https://fansided.com/2018/03/26/nylon-calculus-evolution-stephen-curry-pure-point-guard/) or [this graph](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/morris-mvp-curry-0412-2.png?w=1150) in [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/)."
Stephen Curry
Stephen curry is up 3-1 on LeBron in the finals  And what 29-0 on the rockets?
"WS/48 is a near perfect indicator of who should have won MVP in a given year. Based on this among players receiving MVP votes in a given year, the following players should have been MVP while Lebron was in the league.  * 2004 - Kevin Garnett * 2005 - Dirk Nowitzki/Kevin Garnett (tie) * 2006 - Dirk Nowitzki * 2007 - Dirk Nowitzki * 2008 - Chris Paul * 2009 - Lebron James * 2010 - Lebron James * 2011 - Lebron James * 2012 - Lebron James * 2013 - Lebron James * 2014 - Kevin Durant * 2015 - Stephen Curry * 2016 - Stephen Curry * 2017 - Kevin Durant (or Kawhi Leonard if you dismiss Durant for missing too many games). * 2018 - James Harden  * 2019 -  Giannis Antekoumpo  Long story short, Lebron probably should have won Rose’s MVP, he was the best player and lost because the Heat were the hyped team and didn’t finish as the 1 seed. There are no other years Lebron should really hold claim to, although he had some solid second place finishes.  James Harden, another guy people whine about not winning multiple MVP only really deserved it the one year. Westbrook shouldn’t have won his, but Kawhi probably should have won that one for leading a 60+ win Spurs team.  Dirk got jobbed by Nash harder than any other player has gotten jobbed for MVPs, and Chris Paul lost out on his MVP to the Kobe Bryant career achievement award."
Listen I am not A Warriors hater I acknowledge the fact that you guys were a championship caliber team last year better than the Rockets that year and probably would’ve won if Klay didn’t get injured. I rooted for the Raptors by the way they are my second favorite team and despite that I could be objective.  Stephen Curry religiously get screwed I remember hearing that he had bruises all over his body the next sat after a finals against the cavs. Klay however it doesn’t really hunt for fouls I remember Steve Kerr saying after a big night for him(I think it was his 60 point game) say something along the lines of I’ve been trying to get Klay to seek out more contact for a while.  ￼

Replace the word black with everytime you mention asian and replace Lin's name with any black athlete. Ask yourself if you'd make the same comment.

I mean.. he needs to get a whole lot better at shooting to rival Stephen Curry's shooting. Curry makes 25% more three's per shot than Trae.
Stephen Curry   I hated him for literary no reason even before the thunder (i'm a thunder fan) lost to the warriors 4-3. Now I finally see what I amazing player he is.
"Travel aside, two things I still take away from this is:  1. It was fun as hell watching Steph and James Harden battle against each other to see who would lead the league in 3PM cause the way Harden was shooting, he almost caught the 402 record meanwhile Steph would’ve topped it and then some if he didn’t miss those 11 games (had a hell of a start to the 2018-19 szn too). James Harden ended with 378 triples meanwhile Stephen Curry ended with 354 at the end so it was still very historic.  and  2. Those Kings/Warriors games last season got my hopes up that there could be a possible playoff series because all 4 games between the two were SUPER close and it seemed that the fast pace/shooting of the Kings could keep up with the Warriors. It took some insane games from the big 3 in GS (Steph/Klay/KD) to beat them and it certainly would’ve been interesting to see how they would’ve fared in the postseason."
"&gt;Shaq and Penny  Young Shaq and Penny. Miller is overrated, I will take Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson without a doubt. Watch the 4th, 5th, and 6th best player in that teams and you see how watered down was the 90'."
Honestly true.. these large platform educated athletes should be using their reach to educate the young that look up to them.   I want to hear more from Kyrie about these global political affairs. Stephen Curry can spearhead our NASA program as well.

"Title of the thread:  &gt;""If Stephen Curry leads the Warriors to championships the next two seasons, where does it put him in the GOAT conversation?""  The person you responded to:  &gt; ""Not better then Durant till he has more finals Mvps than him""  How you responded:  &gt; 100000% better than Durant. Curry has shown he can win as the face of a franchise, Durant hasn't.  This is present tense, pardon me if I'm wrong, which I'm not, but you said he's *shown* he can win as the face of the franchise. This doesn't prove anything in a conversation about (title) ""leading"" teams to championships unless you'd be talking about 2015. That run is one of the most underwhelming runs I've seen, he did not face a single healthy team but you are acting like winning in his situation was that great a feat. It wasn't.   And it's not debatable, KD is the better player. He is also the ""greater"" player by most"
"Title of the thread:  ""*If Stephen Curry leads the Warriors to championships the next two seasons, where does it put him in the GOAT conversation?*""  The person I responded to:  *""Not better then Durant till he has more finals Mvps than him""*  We're talking about a hypothetical situation where Curry wins another ring or two. In this hypothetical Curry is clearly better, whether he wins some FMVPs or not.  In terms of present tense, it's debatable.   Durant could have been the undisputed better player if he succeeded on his own. He chose not to. He hurt his own legacy in the same way Canelo hurt his by ducking prime Golovkin. If you want to consider yourself one of the best then you have to compete against and overcome the best.   As it stands, Durant's regular-season resume is worse than Curry's and so is his playoff resume."
Stephen Curry had an 11pt finals game and nobody talks about it because KD single handily won that game.
At the time Stephs contract wasn't that weird.

"PG: 2015-16 Stephen Curry  SG: 1990-91 Michael Jordan  SF: 2012-13 LeBron James  PF: 1985-86 Larry Bird or 2003-04 Kevin Garnett (not sure who is better to put here)  C: 1999-00 Shaquille O’Neal  The gravity of Curry + the gravity of O’Neal with LeBron and Jordan operating the offense would be absolutely ridiculous. I think I would lean Garnett’s peak over Bird’s peak here personally but I’m pretty conflicted, both are great off-ball players with elite passing vision, but I think I prefer Garnett’s defense masking potential O’Neal deficiencies over the better scoring from Bird when I already have 4 of the greatest scorers ever."
"KD’s OKC stats show what his numbers look like when he’s not playing with Curry. You can also look at KD’s GSW stats when Curry is off the floor, it’s the same story. I’ve linked a 538 article and a Tom Haberstroh article discussing the on/off differences. GSW went 32-4 when Curry played without Durant (including the playoffs last season) which is a 73 win pace. GSW went 28-19 when Durant played without Curry which is a 48 win pace (7th or 8th seed in the west, there weren’t any WCF or finals games played in this sample like Curry’s sample).  From Tom Haerstroh’s article, of the 24 permutations of GSW’s 4 all-stars; any ineup w/o Curry played like a fringe playoff team at very best and all lineups were historically great w/ Curry.  4 of the lineup permutations:  Lineup	Net Rating	Minutes  Solo Steph, Plus-14.3, 216  Solo Klay, Plus-4.4, 402  Solo KD, Minus-0.5, 417  Solo Draymond, Minus-2.0, 209  538 on/off article: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/  Tom Haberstroh on/off article:  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/nba-insider-tom-haberstroh/steph-curry-warriors-breaking-point  Also, you provided no sources and it feels like you’re making things up."
"That’s exactly what it is. A shooter’s gravity is supposed to cause mistakes. You think “holy shit, it’s Stephen Curry, I have to prevent him from shooting a 3” that you do it even at the cost of a more important or correct defensive assignment."
"First of all, Steph was not the catalyst of this play. If anything KD is the one who got the block and initiated the transition.   Second of all, What you’re not realizing is if you do this For curry you have to do this for every single time Curry scores. Your lax definition of ‘gravity’ means anytime a player scores, It’s Bc of a teammate which is obviously Insane rhetoric.   Steph Shoots 60% of his shots wide open, If every time Steph gets wide open are you crediting his teammate for having gravity to help him get open?   Unless you can calculate all of KD’s shots directly off Curry’s gravity, You simply can’t make outlandish statements like these.   59% of Stephen Curry’s shots were wide open in these finals. How does curry get open so often despite defenses only paying attention to him?  The gravity rhetoric is clearly overblown by curry fanatics like Ben Taylor."
Stephen Curry was also a huge beneficiary of a GOAT scorer like Kevin Durant. Teams can’t load up on him the same way.  I simply don’t see how you can credit Curry for standing in the corner &amp; KD continuously hitting shot after shot over tough defenses.
This is crazy talk. People were trying to give Lebron finals MVP in 2015 even though his efficiency was terrible.  He got more MVP votes than Stephen Curry who averaged 26/6/5 on 59 TS% for fucks sake.
"I want better spacing, so:  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: LeBron James  PF; Dirk Nowitzki  C: Hakeem Olajuwon"
This was Davidson Stephen Curry a year before his final form as well.
 1. Steve Nash or Trae Young: Nash   2. Dirk Nowitzki or Nikola Jokic: Dirk   3. Kobe Bryant or Kawhi Leonard: Kawhi   4. Tim Duncan or Anthony Davis: 🙄 TD   5.

"Yeah OP, try reading the first paragraph of a story before posting it:  &gt;&gt; When I released the paperback edition of The Book of Basketball in 2009, I ranked Scottie Pippen 24th all time as a Level Four Hall of Fame Pyramid guy. On my 2020 list, he’s been passed by four players—Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Dirk Nowitzki and Kevin Durant—landing him at 28th. Here’s what I wrote about Scottie in my book."
Steve Nash  Nikola Jokic  Kawhi Leonard  Tim Duncan  Zion Williamson  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Chris Paul  LeBron James  James Harden  Stephen Curry
AD has never been a better basketball player than James Harden or Stephen Curry
"Well no cause Roy Hibbert isn’t a point guard. He’s not mobile like a point guard, he can’t dribble like a point guard, but Simmons and presumably a Roy Hibbert sized Stephen Curry would be able to do that."
"You really need some big men in there. I'd include Wilt and Kareem since they were impossible to defend in the post. Kareem was even respectable for his position at the free throw line. I kind of want to include Maravich because I feel like he would have dominated today. Even during his final, injury filled season, he made something like 10/15 3s. Imagine what Maravich could have done if he had 3 other All-nba level players along side him during the peak of his career.  I know you asked for 5, but I feel like there are 10-12 people who realistically have a very strong argument for top 5:  Michael Jordan Wilt Chamberlain Kareem Abdul Jabbar Kobe Bryant Kevin Durant LeBron James Pete Maravich Stephen Curry Larry Bird Rick Barry George Gervin James Harden  And from the outside looking in would be Jerry West, Julius Irving, Adrian Dantley, Alex English, Benard King, Tracy McGrady, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Jerry West, Carmelo Anthony, and Hakeem Olajuwon.  If I had to pick just 5, I'd personally go with:  Wilt since he was an unstoppable force for the most part.  Jordan because of his ability to attack the basket, his mid-range, and his free throw ability. Kareem because he had an unstoppable move, was good at the line for his position, and was a monster in the post.  Bird because of his all-around offensive game and his ability to burn you from outside and at the line(at an all-time clip given his volume).  Maravich because I think his career was short-changed given the talent around him and the era he played in. I genuinely think he could have been an all-time great instead of a HOFamer who deserved better if his career started in the 2010s. He's probably the weakest player on my list and I wouldn't mind switching him out with 5-7 other players since there's a lot of what-ifs surrounding him.   Kobe because he was basically a notch below Jordan at most things, but made up for it somewhat by being a better shooter from our side. Especially if you take away Jordan's inflated seasons.   I'm not sure if I missed anyone, but I think that covers all players in the general discussion for greatest scorers ever."

“Does Stephen Curry play for the Golden State Jazz?”
&gt; Curry's injury history is a broken hand.  That's not true - https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stephen-curry-player-injuries
I know how r/nba works but the answer is Stephen Curry.  It shouldn't be a debate. The man is the undisputed master of the most difficult skill in basketball. He also won the only undisputed MVP trophy off of pure skill.   What are we discussing here?
BANG! ***BAANG!***   OH WHAT A SHOT FROM STEPHEN CURRY!   WITH 6 TENTHS OF A SECOND REMAINING!   THE BRILLIANT SHOOTING OF STEPHEN CURRY CONTINUES!  I watch that clip like 10 times a year
The original Stephen Curry
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2714146-stephen-curry-on-friendship-with-kevin-durant-feel-like-im-on-a-dating-show  When I search for stuff on steph curry talking about the relationship with KD, this is the main thing that pops up. And some other articles of steph praising KD, or vice versa. Would you mind providing a source for your claim?"
Omri Casspi (four) and Stephen Curry (five) combined to hit nine three-pointers while recording 29 of the game's combined 31 points in the final 3 minutes of the second quarter.
Stephen curry pulled a 2011 Lebron.
"I disagree. Curry's first contract extension was notably below market rate as a result of his ankle injuries, and [even that cheap deal was called an overspend at the time.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1391383-stephen-curry-contract-extension-is-risky-business-for-golden-state-warriors)  He absolutely had the reputation of having glass ankles for a significant period of time, even if in retrospect that reputation was unfair."
"Ao at 1 point, he blew a 3-1 lead. He is now definitely the successor of Stephen Curry."

Not if you're Stephen Curry. Then it's virtually impossible to get a damn call.
Stephen Curry is better than Kevin Durant
Would you build a team around Stephen Curry or Durant?

"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2846989-stephen-curry-vs-magic-johnson-nbas-goat-pg-debate-is-closer-than-you-think  Stop being arrogant, there clearly are several arguments for why Curry is the best PG of all time. Magic still wins it, in my opinion, but to disregard Curry like that is asinine. And the article sums up pretty well why it could go both ways, even though Magic appears to have the lead."
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2640001-stephen-curry-responds-to-lebron-james-comments-on-stars-unanimous-mvp  article goes into lebron spec. and some other players. you should be able to find the videos off this.  as far as other players not liking steph, type it into google or youtube. pros are on video and articles speaking on it"
16-19 Stephen Curry  91-93 Mcihael Jordan  2016-2018 Lebron James  94-95 Hakeem  00-02 Shaq  Bench:  08-09 Chris Paul  06-10 Kobe Bryant  17-19 Kevin Durant  11 Dirk  70s Kareem
" The scariest part about KD in those 11 minutes is he was on a team with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond, and Iggy. All all-stars and a 2x MVP. No one but Lowry, Gasol and Kawhi was an all-star and no MVPs, nor championship players other than Kawhi as well.   Don’t get me wrong KD was cooking, but he wasn’t scary. What was scary was the cheat code TEAM being fully healthy. KD with Kyrie will not be “scary” they’ll be good but not “we’re going to lose” scary."
"Last names only for letters  C - Curry, Stephen  O - Oladipo, Victor  V - Vucevic, Nikola  I - Irving, Kyrie  D - Davis, Anthony  1 - Devin Booker  9 - Serge Ibaka"
"Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association."
He was a once in a generation player. It’d be like LeBron dying a couple years after retirement. Or Stephen Curry.. it’s just not supposed to happen that soon. Kobe felt invincible.
1. Magic Johnson 2. Stephen Curry 3. Oscar Robertson 4. John Stockton 5. Bob Cousy 6. Chris Paul 7. Isiah Thomas 8. Steve Nash 9. Walt Frazier 10. Jason Kidd  Westbrook is definitely better than a couple of those guys
"That video is pretty dumb. Gobert is obviously a better defender than Whiteside, but cherry picking Whiteside plays to show him making mistakes is really laughable.  Can’t wait to watch why Stephen Curry is a better shooter than Damian Lillard"
I’d rather Lebron win 0 more and Stephen Curry wins 3 more and Kawhi wins 2 more to make things more interesting.
"He’s only like a 6 time AS and 6x All-NBA. Karl Malone sitting here with 14 of both.   Stephen Curry could totally be at that ranking by the end of his career, but he’s only been doing it for a short while. Plus, only one of his rings could you say he was the definitive best player."
"&gt;Doesn’t fail the sniff test in my opinion. Lol. Hakeem is one of the best defensive players of all time, Stockton was obviously great at steals but became a revolving door in a lot of situations, in no universe would you call him a comparable defender to Hakeem. Steals rob your opponent of a possession and simultaneously gain your team an extra possession so u can understand why they are heavily weighted, but maybe the issue here is that steals/rim protection/guarding are totally different ways of contributing to your team defensively, and should not be lumped together as a singular ""rating."" Who do you want protecting the basket if someone like Lebron is coming down the floor? TD, Hakeem? Absolutely not John Stockton or Stephen Curry, I'll say that much."
The only reason he has rings is because of some little unknown ball players by the names of Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.
"Also, if you look at the 20 most dominant seasons ever (judging by to Wins Above Replacement), MJ is inescapable:  * Michael Jordan	- 1988	- 24.36  * Stephen Curry	- 2016	- 23.66  * Chris Paul	- 2009	- 23.57  * Michael Jordan	- 1989	- 23.08  * LeBron James	- 2009	- 22.80  * Michael Jordan	- 1991	- 22.75  * LeBron James	- 2010	- 21.81  * Michael Jordan	- 1990	- 21.75  * John Stockton	- 1989	- 21.01  * Michael Jordan	- 1996	- 20.97  * Michael Jordan	- 1993	- 20.29  * Kevin Garnett	- 2004	- 20.28  * Michael Jordan	- 1992	- 20.16  * David Robinson	- 1994	- 20.15  * John Stockton	- 1991	- 20.14  * James Harden	- 2019	- 20.06  * John Stockton	- 1992	- 19.99  * Stephen Curry	- 2015	- 19.91  * Kevin Garnett	- 2003	- 19.89"
"That’s an age and injury thing (as well as a steroid thing) more than it is a league wide trend towards slimming down.  Players literally play fewer minutes so they can run with bulkier bodies while they’re in.  We see people like Stephen Curry look skinny when they stand next to LeBron or Draymond, but the reality is even he is close to 200 lbs of lean muscle.  MJ got strong enough to take the pistons beating when he bulked up to 215 lbs at 6’6."
Stephen Curry! Klay Thompson! Kevin Durant! Draymond Green!........ oh.... and yeah Zara whatever
"Here’s a more fun one  &gt;	Trading Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson for anyone—even an all-time great point guard like Chris Paul—seems downright irresponsible now, but the Golden State Warriors almost did so in 2011.  &gt;	During an interview with UNINTERRUPTED, Paul, who was on the New Orleans Hornets at the time, confirmed he told the Warriors he would not sign an extension with them if they pulled the trigger on the trade   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2888994-chris-paul-confirms-he-rejected-2011-warriors-trade-involving-steph-curry-klay  IIRC Ekpe Udoh was was also a key piece of this trade"
stephen curry sends kawhi leonard through spin cycle  [https://youtu.be/mUF8MGH9Fh8](https://youtu.be/mUF8MGH9Fh8)
"This whole ""Curry is weak"" narrative is not only stupid considering what he's accomplished against the most athletic competition in the history of the NBA, [but also because it's been documented that he has ridiculous core and leg strength](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephen-curry-can-deadlift-400-pounds/)."
"Current: Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic  All-time: Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal"
There were a couple seasons where dray had more assists than curry and he has more total Assists in the playoffs. By your extremely flawed logic draymond is a better point guard than Stephen Curry. Curry changed how basketball/ point guard is played the “true point guard” is becoming extinct in the nba due to Steph. Guys like dame and Trae are the new standard at point guard because of how Steph changed the position. Lastly your point that Steph is top 3 when he is clearly the best shooter of all Time discussion is a joke.
Stephen Curry playoff averages from 2015-2019  • 27.2 PTS • 5.7 REB • 5.9 AST • 45.3% FG • 40.3% 3PT • 90.7% FT • 68-25 record • 5 Conference Titles • 3 NBA Titles • 0 FMVP
"This is kind of an odd take on it, but here are some of my favorite individual seasons ever from players:  1. Stephen Curry, 2015-16  2. Kawhi Leonard, 2015-16  3. Draymond Green, 2015-16  4. Tim Duncan, 2002-03  5. Ben Wallace, 2003-04  6. Kevin Garnett, 2003-04  7. Shawn Marion, 2002-03  8. Andre Iguodala, 2014-15  9. Gary Payton, 1995-96  10. Scottie Pippen, 1993-94  I feel like whenever I'm thinking of building a hypothetical team, these are the players I always think of first. These are players I've watched good amounts of game tape on and always keep coming back to. As you can tell, I like elite defense."
"For those wondering about this reference, in 2015 there was an ESPN article which mentioned that Curry could trap bar deadlift 400 lbs, which was the second-most on the Warriors after Festus Ezeli.  https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2015/story/_/id/13019137/2015-nba-playoffs-how-stephen-curry-put-ankle-issues-him"
You get Stephen Curry with a 40 inch vertical
"I can’t think of anything specific but a warriors cavs finals game would be good. The game plan the warriors have is the best of modern basketball, with slick passing and fire at will play. Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter ever, and makes some ridiculous shots. The plays are really fun to watch. On the other side, you have Kyrie, a master ball handler, and Lebron James, a physical specimen and one of the top 2 GOATs. I am not a fan of either team, but would recommend their matchups to experience modern b-ball for the first time."
Stephen Curry
"klay is home grown and loyal to his franchise and is also the second greatest shooter of all time behind stephen curry.  Let what that means sink in. and he holds post season records all by himself.   so no, not basically Klay. low effort"
"That says more to the bulls luck than anything. It took a) the warriors on a historic collapse and losing while up 3-1 in the finals, which had never happened before (unfortunately, they just happened to be playing the second best player of all time) and b) a severe string of injuries to basically every key player not named Stephen Curry. If either one of those things don’t happen, the warriors repeat.   If the same thing happened where Jordan randomly had pippen out for all of the finals and Rodman misses most of the games, I think we could say Jordan would’ve lost one of those finals as well."
Hmm let me try  deopwf frmiofer (Stephen Curry)  mfoeiof miemfw (LeBron James)  Andrei Kirilenko (Brook Lopez)  man i suck at this
My point was that he couldn’t lose an injured Kevin Love. Who has literally never in any other situation ever successfully guarded Stephen Curry.
"My own idea is kinda like this:  50s-60s: almost impossible to compare to any other era due to different rules, for example the strict dribbling rules didn't allow for fancy crossovers and jukes we see today. 70s-early 80s: comparable. Keep in mind the three pointer wasn't introduced to the NBA until 1979. This era set the modern standard for big men as formidable post defenders (Wes Unseld) were more common than ever before. Late 80s-early 2000s: comparable. Often considered the golden age of basketball due to the fierce competition, rough defense, and a swarm of NBA legends (Jordan, Bird, Magic, Hakeem...) Late 2000s-early 2010s: hybrid of today's game and the 80s-90s era so definitely comparable to today's game. Shooting 3s was gradually becoming a more popular scoring option (Ray Allen was Stephen Curry before Stephen Curry). Mid 2010s-current: The style of today's game is all about shooting 3s (Stephen Curry started this craze for sure) and scoring as fast as possible whereas teams of previous eras preferred to wind down the shot clock before. The playing style of traditional big men from previous eras is gone. Big men are attempting more 3s than ever. This is really the first time the league has been offense-oriented as opposed to defense."
Allen Iverson Brent Barry Chris Mullin Danny Ferry Eric Snow Fred Van Vleet Greg Monroe Harry Giles Isaac Bonga Jason Kidd Kurt Thomas  Lou Williams Michael Jordan  Nate Robinson Oscar Robertson Pau Gasol Quinn Cook Rasheed Wallace Stephen Curry Tim Thomas Udonis Haslem Vince Carter Wes Unseld Couldn’t think of one haha Yao Ming Zion Williamson
It would be fun if someone created a time machine to transport Stephen Curry to the 1990s to hustle Michael Jordan in shooting competitions.
"KD is the better scorer. Harden usually puts up slightly more points, but KD does it on slightly better efficiency (although Harden is also extremely efficient, KD is almost unrivaled in terms of efficiency with only Kareem and Curry being at that sort of level).  Just to put into perspective how insanely efficient Durant is:  Players to put up numbers better than 27 PTS/75 on +9 rTS%:  * Adrian Dantley: 1983-84 * Charles Barkley: 1990-91 * Amar'e Stoudemire: 2007-08 * LeBron James: 2012-13, 2013-14 * Stephen Curry: 2015-16, 2017-18 * Durant - 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17  Only five players other than Durant have ever done it, with only Curry and LeBron doing it twice, and Durant did it for FIVE STRAIGHT SEASONS!  Harden is the better passer and playmaker of the two, but in terms of just scoring, I have to give the edge to Durant."
"Malone only accounts for one stat: the assists. I don't know if anybody has ever actually counted how many of Stockton's assists went to Malone. Somebody in another sub-thread here suggested it was one-third. If you take away 1/3 of Stockton's assists that still leaves him in second place all time, which would make him a pretty great all-time passer if he never played a game with Malone (and assuming whoever you put in Malone's place never made a basket).  But Malone has nothing to do with Stockton being by far the best stealer in history, or an elite shooter. He was a better shooter than Isiah Thomas by a wide margin:  FG: .515 to .452  3FG: .384 to .290  FT: .826 to .759  When you [compare those four PGs you mentioned](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=John+Stockton&amp;player_id1_select=John+Stockton&amp;player_id1=stockjo01&amp;player_id2_hint=Magic+Johnson&amp;player_id2_select=Magic+Johnson&amp;player_id2=johnsma02&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;player_id3_hint=Isiah+Thomas&amp;player_id3_select=Isiah+Thomas&amp;player_id3=thomais01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;player_id4_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id4_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id4=curryst01&amp;idx=bbr__players), Stockton and Magic actually match up pretty well. They have near identical shooting numbers from the field and the line, though Stockton was significantly better from deep. Steph is in his own world as a three point and free throw shooter, but not nearly as good as Stockton overall from the field. He's also much younger. Let's see how his numbers hold up when he's played 300 more games to get to Magic's and Isiah's longevity. He'd have to more than double the number of games he's played in his career to match Stockton. That's a lot of mileage on those legs, and it'll get harder and harder to lift up for threes, so let's see how he does.  When you normalize the numbers to account for differences in minutes and possessions, Stockton rises further to the top. Per 100 possessions, Stockton averaged nearly 17 assists. Magic only averaged 14.5, and Isiah only 12.4. Stockton averaged 3.5 steals per 100 possessions and one of people's all-time picks for greatest defender, Gary Payton, only averaged 2.7.  And when you look at the more advanced stats like win shares, assist percentage, and value over replacement player, it's not even close. Stockton destroys them all.  You can crow about championships all you want. That's ultimately the reason you play every season, to win a title, so that's fair to an extent. But it's also not possible to compare across seasons or generations. Are you going to argue Steph Curry is a better point guard, or a better player, than Stockton because he won titles and Stockton didn't? Steph's teams were stacked. The late 90s Jazz won 62 and 64 games and made the Finals twice with half their roster being second rounders or undrafted. Outside of Stockton and Malone that Jazz team only had one other All-Star (Hornacek) and he only ever made one All-Star team his entire career. The 2018 Warriors had six All-Stars, all but one having made multiple All-Star teams."
"You're entirely wrong about the 1st part. Entirely.   Secondly, if I recall, cp3 and Harden got smacked by a KD less warriors. at houston. in a do or die game 6. with curry scoreless at the half.   ya'll folk on r/nba need to stop making excuses and start living in the real world. Harden, Cp3, Westbrook, etc are not the players you think they are. Internalize that: *they are not the players you **think** they are*  the fact remains in a 5v5 setting, who gets it done? stephen curry and klay thompson have proven time and time again with their backs against the wall what championship dna looks like, and that automatically ranks them higher than the likes of harden, cp3, westbrook, paul george"
"Magic Johnson, Stephen Curry and Oscar Robertson are often players that are considered top be the top 3 point guards of all time. Here are some point guards that are often considered to be on the ""Stockton"" tier. John completely blows those guys out of the water in the advanced stats department.

"Imo there is a bunch of players that should already be in the Hall of Fame (in no particular order): - Chris Webber - Shawn Kemp - Ben Wallace - Dikembe Mutombo  - Chauncey Billups - Tim Hardaway  - Mark Price - Kevin Johnson - Mark Jackson  - Toni Kukoc - Shawn Marion  And among recently retired or even active players (in no particular order): - LeBron James  - Dirk Nowitzki  - Kevin Durant  - Stephen Curry  - Dwyane Wade - Tony Parker - Manu Ginobili  - Pau Gasol - Chris Paul  - James Harden - Russell Westbrook  - Dwight Howard  - Carmelo Anthony  - Vince Carter  If Mitch Richmond is a member of the Hall of Fame, then the aforementioned players must also be enshrined there."

"&gt; KD is clearly the best offensive player in the nba though and I think the only people that would disagree are hardcore Curry and Harden stans. You guys can talk about gravity and stretching a defence all you like but if I have the ball and I NEED a bucket, there’s no question I’m giving it to KD over Steph, and that rang true when they both played together, Kevin was the first option  Is KD the better 1v1 player ? Of course, no question. Does that mean he’s the more valuable offensive player ? Of course not. If I need a bucket, I’m picking Jamal Crawford over Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook. Does that mean Jamal Crawford’s a better offensive player than CP3 or Westbrook ? Fuck no.  Use your head. There’s a reason the Cavs would double and trap Curry and run to him first on fast breaks while letting KD get George Hill on the block whenever he wanted. Why would the Cavs [throw multiple guys](https://www.google.com/amp/s/lebronwire.usatoday.com/2018/05/29/tyronn-lue-cleveland-cavaliers-throw-multiple-guys-stephen-curry-george-hill-golden-state-warriors-nba-finals/amp/) at Steph and let KD 1v1 whenever he wanted if KD is the bigger threat ??  Lol only hardcore Curry stans think Steph is more dangerous offensively than KD, yet THEIR FUCKING OPPONENTS SAID STEPH IS MORE OF A THREAT  &gt; Also, one series doesn’t define a player, especially not one that you bricked a wide open perfect look 3 to lose the series. Kawhi just averaged 30+ across the entire playoffs, going against MUCH better defensive teams, while locking down superstars on defence and pulling down nearly 10 boards a night. We’re talking about players in totality not just how much they score.  That’s just incorrect dude. The Raptors were the best playoff defensive team since the 00’s Pistons, the Magic and the 6ers were not “MUCH better defensive teams” lmao.   Also, you’re acting like Steph averaging 30 while being the absolute center of defensive attention is an outlier. Just the series before, he averaged 37 PPG on 67% TS% in a sweep of the WCF and just the series before that, he scored 33 in the 2nd half and closed out the Rockets at Houston w/o KD  Kawhi isn’t more of an offensive threat than Steph, even in that 2019 finals series where Kawhi was facing mostly single coverage and Steph was box and one’d, Steph still outplayed Kawhi offensively, i really don’t know how you could be arguing this  &gt; his size doesn’t allow him to do certain things DOES separate him from the very top guys like Bron, KD, and Kawhi.  We all know what you’re point is, we’re trying to explain to you why your point is wrong but you don’t seem to get it"
There's this guy named Stephen Curry you should watch some time.
You cannot tell me with a straight face that Tony Parker is better than Stephen Curry in this situation. FMVPs are kind of irrelevant as to who is the better player.
"From the 2010s guys I think the final resting places will be:  1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Chris Paul  Where that puts him all time? Probably ends up Top 15, given people have Durant ranked 14th right now.   I’m assuming he wins at least 1 championship for the Clippers in this. If he fails at that, he will be ranked below Durant and be in the 18-25 range."
"I absolutely agree.  Steph has been better than KD since his first MVP.  Certainly he has been better on offense, and in my opinion that gap is bigger than the defensive gap.   Offensive impact comes down to how well you score individually and how well you help your teammates score (either through assists, or screens, drawing double teams, etc.) As scorers they have been roughly equal, Steph's edge in efficiency is roughly as valuable as KD's edge in volume.  However, Steph has a substantial edge in how much he helps his teammates score.    Scoring is all about how many points you can score and how many possessions you use to score those points.  They're pretty much equals here, over their careers Steph averages 23.5 points on 18.8 true shot attempts (best easily calculable measure of possessions used) while KD averages 27.0 points on 22.1 TSA per game.  So KD is giving you 3.5 more points on 3.2 more possessions, a TS of 55.1% - pretty much league average.  So most teams should be pretty much indifferent between the 3.5 more points KD gives and the 3.2 additional possessions he uses to get those points.    Steph does a lot more to improve his teammates than KD.  He is consistently top (or among the top 3 or so with LeBron and Harden) in the league at improving his teammates efficiency.  KD is not.  Considering even the highest volume players of all time top out at around 40% usage, improving teammates' efficiency is (significantly) more important than scoring yourself.  See for example [this graph](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,f_auto,h_912,w_672/https%3A%2F%2Ffansided.com%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F03%2F04-Curry-PG-Teammate-TS.jpg) and [this graph] (https://fansided.com/files/2018/03/05-Curry-PG-Teammate-TS-vs-TS.jpg) in [this article](https://fansided.com/2018/03/26/nylon-calculus-evolution-stephen-curry-pure-point-guard/) or [this graph](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/morris-mvp-curry-0412-2.png?w=1150) in [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/)."
"There’s a really huge gap between being paid like Stephen Curry and Draymond (double digits). If you’re putting up star numbers and helping lead your team to wins you’re gonna expect higher salaries. And it’s completely relevant considering there’s a luxury tax. Owners have to make levels between contracts. This is really undervaluing the importance of money to NBA players. If they had a chance at say, the supermax, as opposed to being a second option, I absolutely think they’d take the supermax."
"Mostly eye test tbh. For what it's worth, the [advanced stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;player_id2_select=Damian+Lillard&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=lillada01&amp;idx=bbr__players) seem to be pretty universally in Curry's favor in the regular season and even more so in the playoffs"
"It's one of the many factors you should look at. No, the best player doesn't win it every season, but if you look at it on a macro level instead of year-to-year:  Kareem: 6x MVP  Bill Russell and MJ: 5x MVP  Wilt and LeBron: 4x MVP  Moses, Larry, and Magic: 3x MVP  Bob Pettit, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, Stephen Curry: 2x MVP  The best players seem to get it more often."
"Point guards I would take over Westbrook.  Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Oscar Robertson, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Allen Iverson, Stephen Curry, Isiah Thomas, Jerry West, Chris Paul.  Hard to be top 20 when you are looking at maybe being top the 10th best point guard all time.  // I wanted to add Gary Payton to the list but that is a stretch."
"Maybe Kerr was lying to cover for somebody or something, but it sounds like it was an organizational decision  &gt; This brings up the question: why didn't Steve want this for the Warriors ""last dance?"" &gt;  &gt; Simple. He didn't view the 2018-19 season as their last.  &gt;  &gt; ""You think about our situation with the Warriors, and we didn't have a final season,"" Kerr said. ""We're trying to keep this thing going. A lot of our players are still here, and we're trying to rev it back up, so there was no sense of finality. If anything, we're trying to avoid that."" &gt;  &gt; Kevin Durant's (then) upcoming free agency was the main topic of discussion during the 2018-19 season. Unlike the Bulls, Durant hadn't yet made his decision and the Warriors still had their original Big Three: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. &gt;  &gt; With Chicago, owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause made it known they had decided to part ways with head coach, Phil Jackson, before the season began. Jordan also said he wouldn't play for any coach other than Jackson. Krause felt that the Bulls were too old and decided it was time to rebuild.  &gt;  &gt; ""Having everybody in, inviting the world in and inviting cameras in and saying, 'Hey, we want to capture the final days of this run,' it's like you're violating a principle of the sanctity of the locker room,"" Kerr continued. ""So it never occurred to me, nor does it now, to do anything of the sort for our team.""  https://957thegame.radio.com/articles/golden-state-warriors/kerr-didnt-allow-warriors-edition-of-the-last-dance"

"Even when Klay &amp; Durant weren't on the floor though, his other teammates become more efficient. Every single one, and by record amounts. Obviously when Klay and KD were on, it was usually more extreme, but a lot of that is just on Curry. Here's a good read about it if you want to check it out in more detail.   [https://fansided.com/2018/03/26/nylon-calculus-evolution-stephen-curry-pure-point-guard/](https://fansided.com/2018/03/26/nylon-calculus-evolution-stephen-curry-pure-point-guard/)"
"[ESPN article with videos, from December of 2015](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14269158/how-stephen-curry-wrecks-defenses-touching-ball)"
"I think you have to start with the Warriors as your base. Steph, Klay, and Draymond are a championship caliber core that have fallen on hard times.  From there you have to define playoff contention.   Right now in the West, if the season were to actually play out fully, Pelicans have a 60% chance, Blazers 14%, Grizzlies 15%, and Kings 9%.  We can consider these teams in contention. There will likely be a play-in tournament to get into the playoffs. So 7-10 will play-in, so everyone with a solid chance of getting to the 10th seed is in contention.  Spurs/Wizards are both at 2% probability of making the playoffs and everyone else is below 1% or already eliminated. So I would say Spurs/Wizards don’t count as in contention but the other teams do, which takes the Pelicans off the board.  So if I have Steph/Klay as my base, I want role players that can fit around that core. I think the Bulls fit that the best.  * PG - Stephen Curry/Coby White/Kris Dunn * SG - Klay Thompson/Zach Lavine * SF - Otto Porter/Andrew Wiggins * PF - Draymond Green/Thaddeus Young/Eric Paschall * C - Lauro Markannen/Wendell Carter  I would roll with the following 12-man lineup and I would make Steve Kerr the coach. I would say this is the be the best Warriors team of all time."

"And that view makes zero logical sense, it's purely a sequential matter. If I have a cup of water filled to the brim, then I add a drop of water and it spills, is that single drop the bigger reason why the cup overflows? No it just pushed it over the hump. Not saying Iggy is equivalent to a drop of water but I'm illustrating how the sequential effect works.   Lebron had 31% shooting in game 2 and 41% shooting game 3. His shooting splits were already horrible but people took the final result, took Iggy being a great defender, and said Lebron averaged 35% because of Iggy. How many of Iggy or even Klay's shots are doubled? How many of Iggy's shots are even contested??? How many traps are set for them? That is absolutely farcical reasoning that would get people fired in any line of work if they presented that conclusion.  If you had to give up one players performance in the finals, do people really rather take out stephen fucking curry before andre iguodala in those finals? If Steph is the one who gets promoted to the starting line-up in game 3 do we not think it's the exact same effect? If Steph didn't play games 1-3 do people actually think the warriors even come within 20 points of winning a single game?  This sort of thing (including players not named curry) makes me so angry that I pretty much just watch the game/highlights/stats and go on with my day without looking at any other 'news source' unless i get told it's a good article.   And the shitty thing is it's the same in almost every facet of life. Zero knowledge, zero analysis, zero objectivity, zero responsibility to inform themselves, just opinion, platitudes, tribalism, and an air of i know it all. People say the analysis doesn't grab views and that's the exact fucking problem   We can do better. We should do better. We are what we consume, including the information and thoughts we share. We can provide the hilarious entertainment Chuck and Shaq provides etc without dumbing down everything at an exponential pace. Without nuance we produce dumb opinions, create division and perpetuate problems."
Steph and Giannis: I’ve decided to team up with (Stephen Curry) (Giannis Antetounmpo)...... to start a foundation......  I had this dream last night and I can’t remember the exact name of the foundation. Just two good guys doing charity work.
we are now entitled to Stephen Curry
 &gt; Stephen Curry in 15   No. 24 | 8 | 4 | 2.  Shooting 49%| 44% | 91%    And his advanced stats makes it so much better. His stat lines were not underwhelming for an MVP
"If we look at the leaderboard of True Shooting in NBA history, Durant Ranks 12th, however there are a handful of lob-catching and at-the-rim finishing role players in that mix, so let's narrow that down to people who averaged more than 10 FGA per game over their careers. That puts Durant 6th:  1. Stephen Curry (.623 TS) 2. Artis Gilmore (.623 TS) 3. Karl-Anthony Towns (.622 TS) 4. Adrian Dantley (.617 TS) 5. Reggie Miller (.614 TS) 6. Kevin Durant (.613 TS)  If we adjust that for what we as modern fans consider great shooters and make the requirement to attempt a minimum of 3+ 3PA per game over their career (picked a number that would keep typical 'great shooter' favourites in contention), and allow some players with under 10 FGA to accommodate for exceptional role players, KD slides up to 4th place.  The top 10 looks like this:  1. Stephen Curry (.623 TS) 2. Karl-Anthony Towns (.622 TS) 3. Reggie Miller (.614 TS) 4. Kevin Durant (.613 TS) 5. James Harden (.610 TS) 6. Brent Barry (.607 TS) \[*6.9 FGA*\] 7. Steve Nash (.605 TS) 8. JJ Redick (.602 TS) \[*9.7 FGA*\] 9. Kyle Korver (.602 TS) \[*7.6 FGA*\] 10. Kawhi Leonard (.597 TS)  There are obviously more factors to being a 'great shooter' than just stats though, so this isn't a conversation-ending or final list by any means. What other qualities make a shooter great to you?"
"Among the 140 players all-time with 15,000+ points, KD ranks 5th in TS%.   It's Artis Gilmore (.643), Stephen Curry (.623), Adrian Dantley (.617), Reggie Miller (.614), and Kevin Durant (.613).   If you up it to 20,000+ points, KD is third behind Dantley and Miller.   Once KD (most likely) gets to 25,000 points, only Miller will be in front of him if KD is able to keep around the same efficiency.  On a side note, it's crazy how Adrian Dantley has 23,177 career points and a .617 career TS%, yet isn't really talked about at all."
"You're overrating the hot hand. The most optimistic take I've seen is 12 percentage points among the 26 college players used in a study, ~8 percentage points for semi-pro players shooting in a gym, and 4 percentage points for four years of the nba 3-point shooting contest.   A 20% jump in shooting on any significant volume, even for a good shooter on a ""hot hand"" night is a very fringe case, and even in those scenarios, try replacing the 3PA with two FTA and the points usually change very little.   For example: in 2018-19, Stephen Curry had 10 games where he shot 60% or better from 3-point range. He made 74 of 113 three-pointers over that period of time, resulting in 222 points. If he were fouled on each of those attempts and shot two FTs, at his career rate of 90.6%, he gets ~205 points.   That's a difference of 17 points in 113 possessions, or an edge of 0.15 PPP, even against one of the best-shooting, highest-volume players."
"Well if i had to rank the players it would go  Stephen Curry Kevin Garnett Paul Pierce Klay Thompson  But as a compliment to each other, you would have to go Steph and Klay."
"""Father of Stephen Curry"""
"&gt; you are writing about the back to back DPOY  In a league/era that is valuing defense less and less as the years go by and where people have turned the award into just putting a name on a sheet.  Remember Kobe's all-defense teams in his later years? I love Kobe's intensity as much as the other guy, but come on.    He's objectively gotten run off the court in the last two playoff series he's played in. Bogut was so good for the Warriors because he could play a role that Gobert cannot (and probably can never) play, a pseudo-point center if you will. He's uncomfortable with the ball in his hands and that would automatically make him a liability to the Warriors who constantly rely on ball movement.   &gt;Not to mention, the greatest shooting backcourt in the history of the game (when healthy) is enough to make GS contenders,   I agree with this. Stephen Curry is my second favorite player, their basketball is not only fun to watch but incredibly efficient. I don't think they need to make any big changes/trade the pick in the first place when I personally love James Wiseman as a prospect."
"If you're going to point out the dip in true shooting, it's true that it went down relative to the regular season. Now let's compare 58.5% true shooting with others. Per [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ts_pct_career_p.html) Lebron has a postseason career average 57.88% TS, Ray Allen has a postseason career average of exactly 58.54% TS. Chris Paul, 57.91%.   You say ""absolutely not a good finals for a superstar in the mid/late 2010's"" and yet there are only four players in the league who have better averages than 58.5%: Kawhi Leonard, **Stephen curry**, Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard, and Tristan Thompson. And we know Dwight isn't who he used to be as of mid/late 2010's, and Tristan Thompson is low volume/not first option. So there are quite literally two players who you can say average better efficiency than Steph's worst finals performance..  if you're saying that a disappointing finals series by a great player means the equivalent of what was previously considered the greatest shooter of all time's average, then..I don't know what to say."

"Virtually every detail from the 2016 Finals. Ten years ago, LeBron was technically still in his first stint with the Cavaliers, so imagine trying to tell someone that:  1. LeBron left the Cavs to form a LBJ-Wade-Bosh super team in Miami, basically building their own custom roster from the ground up.  2. Small school sensation Stephen Curry turns out to be the greatest shooter in NBA history.  3. The Warriors break the single season record for wins, topping the '96 Bulls.  4. LeBron *comes back* to Cleveland and leads them to the Finals in 2015, averaging 36, 13, and 9.   5. Imagine telling someone back then that Cleveland and Golden State would meet in four straight finals *after* LeBron James chose to leave in 2010.   6. The Warriors win three rings.  7. The one ring the Warriors lost came during their record-breaking season, where LeBron leads an inexplicable 3-1 comeback and seals a Game 7 ring for the Cavs with a series-saving last minute chasedown block (while averaging 30, 11, and 9).   8. J.R. Smith celebrates shirtless for days on end.   9. Some guy on the streets of Cleveland eats poop.   10. The Warriors respond by signing Kevin Durant.   Nothing about this timeline isn't insane, just as it pertains to the Warriors and Cavs alone. I don't think I would have believed a single second of it back then."
"Stephen Curry would win a ring before Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Dwight Howard and Kevin Durant"
"Work ethic. All time great players are often just made of different stuff. Tracy McGrady was every bit as talented as Kobe, but didn’t work nearly as hard. Someone like Tyreke Evans won ROY in a class with Stephen Curry and James Harden, but he never improved while they became MVPs. That has more to do with the players themselves than the situations they were drafted to."

"I still don't follow your logic. Equal opportunity is the issue, not a glass ceiling. There being a lack of equal opportunity doesn't mean everyone is held back, it means many are held back. Stephen Curry grew up with Ayesha and Dell as his parents. His life is significantly different than the average person so he wouldn't sit there and go 'nah man, there's equal opportunity!'. Have you never heard a story of someone prevailing through difficulties in life or being a success story with extenuating circumstances?  Care to actually provide some studies that support what you're saying instead of the word of a small sample of people?"

"i watch basketball too and thats the reason im on this sub, because i like basketball, and yes he did have a quick first step but that doesnt mean he had excellent athleticism. Teams in the begging didnt now who he was so he took advantage of it. as soon as teams started to scout him he would have games where he would cost his team the ball game because he would turn the ball over, or have bad shot selections.   he also was never a very good defender because he was not athletic enough to gaurd  average point guards and especially elite ones.   easily one of the most overrated basketball players to come along in the past decade.   He is out of the league now because he was just barely hanging from it, and not that he has comeback from a minor injury, he has lost all his confidence. Confidence that any man should have in order to survive in the league. Just look at derrick rose, russell westbrook, stephen curry , paul george all still in the league from far worse injuries and are still playing at a high level. its because they never gave up and battled through their injuries to still be able to play in the league. something the lin didnt have.   this is my argument if you choose to disagree with me, thats your prerogative"
"As a Warriors fan during the pre-KD Warriors, there was much more hate on the team than people would like to admit. I'll admit that I have tunnel vision from being annoyed by the haters, but there was still massive amounts of hate regardless. Every great team is susceptible to it, to be fair. Some of the most common criticisms/complaints about the Warriors include: Draymond Green is an overrated technical-prone loose cannon who intentionally kicks players in the balls, the Warriors constantly use moving screens, they didn't deserve their 2015 title and they benefited from multiple players injuries, Stephen Curry is a system player who could be replaced by Kyrie/Dame, and of course, ""the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead"". A lot of the hate came from Cavs homers and trolls, but people genuinely took some of these points seriously to discredit the Warriors. From around midway into the 2014-15 season until the day KD joined the Warriors, people loved to parrot these narratives over and over again."
"End of 2011-2012 when they tanked for the 7th pick of the draft instead of conveying it to Utah. Jazz fans were not happy about it lol.  Then in the 2012-2013 season Nuggets and Clippers fans developed a dislike.  2014-2015 regular season brought in Rockets fans because of Curry winning the MVP over Harden and then Cavs fans were brought in during the championship series. Also, some general animus rising due to a couple possible flops by Green and Barnes in the first round series with the Pelicans (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33o3fi/absolutely_shameless_flop_from_draymond_includes/ ). For the record, as a biased Warrior fan, the other replay angle shows elbow contact with the face imo. But that's a digression.  2015 offseason and then 2015-2016 was when it exploded. Imo, there was a uniqueness to the Warrior/Curry hate that season because it was bigger than the Warriors, it was about protecting a basketball philosophy. If you paid attention back then, a common saying was ""a jumpshooting team can't win a championship"" (compare that to now when people say the Lakers might not have enough shooting to win a championship). The perception of the Warriors was that they challenged the conventional wisdom of basketball. So there was an extra level of resentment that was about an order the Warriors were supposedly threatening rather than the Warriors themselves. And when you combine that with Irving and Love getting injured in the Finals, the easiest way to cope or make sense of a possibly paradigm-shifting championship was to consider it a fluke.  And so you saw some comments over the summer from guys like Doc Rivers and Ty Lawson. But then the Warriors started destroying everybody en route to 73-9, and you started hearing from a ton of past players from Stephen Jackson to Cedric Ceballos about how their team would have crushed those Warriors. And then you had the Warriors themselves embracing the villain role if you recall Joe Lacob's ""light years ahead"" comment or Draymond's flying limbs in the playoffs. So when they blew the 3-1 lead, there was a massive release of the Warriors hatred that had been building for awhile. What's funny to me is how much of the hatred took the form of ""no one criticizes Golden Boy Curry even though [insert Golden Boy Curry criticism]"".  Unfortunately for those people, they only had a few weeks until KD joined. I think part of the reason that caused such a big reaction was because normally when a polarizing team loses a series, you have a lot more time to bask in their defeat. Don't get me wrong, people basked in it (as I recall all too clearly lol), but it didn't feel as satisfying knowing KD was going to be there because it felt more temporary.  I'm sure people remember the KD years so I don't have to get into that.  To be clear, there was plenty of love for the Warriors during that time as with all champions, I'm just describing the hate timeline."
[Kevin Durant to agent after leaving OKC: 'Why the fuck did you let me do this to my life?'](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y)
"That Dubs team was so bad.  They only had Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green as their all-stars.  /s"
"If Stephen Curry can win an MVP (unanimously!) by elevating a playoff team to historic levels, Giannis Antetokounmpo can win DPOY by turning a good defensive team into by far the best defense in the league."
I wouldn’t say they “fell off” the next year but the following players had very marginal differences at best from their peak season:  Shaquille O’Neal  Tim Duncan  Kevin Garnett  Dirk Nowitzki  Charles Barkley  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Magic Johnson  Chris Paul  Dwyane Wade  Steve Nash  Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jerry West  Oscar Robertson  Reggie Miller  Scottie Pippen  James Harden  Klay/Dray  Paul Pierce  Bob McAdoo  Dwight Howard  Paul George  Walt Frazier  Sidney Moncrief  Willis Reed
8 years /=/ 15 minutes. And sure it’s not much compared to before it. But draymond got drafted to a team that already had Stephen curry on it and before drays rookie contract was up the warriors were winning a lot. I’m basically just saying comparing booker and drags situations is stupid
"""Yesteday Stephen Curry, playing from San Francisco, shot 7-10 3PT and 15-18FG. Good effort to bring a win to the Warriors against the *reads notes* Charlotte Hornets"""
"TRADITIONAL POINT GUARDS ONLY.  If you ain't pass first, get the fuck out of the league RUSSELL WESTBROOK AND DAMIAN LILLARD AND STEPHEN CURRY"
"Anthony Tolliver was undrafted in 2007, spent a few seasons in and out of the D-League and had been able to stick around at the NBA level since 2010.        Monta Ellis who at one point was considered on the level of Stephen Curry as far as trade talks, and even after had a good few fringe all-star scoring seasons. I'm not sure the fit when he got to the Pacers was right to begin with, but I didn't expect he would practically fall off a cliff immediately after.       Honorable mention to Seth Curry who I thought was in danger of falling into the ""novelty brother of a star"" player trap (see Marquis Teague, Taylor Griffin, Mychel Thompson), especially when he started his career off with the Warriors D-league team.  Credit to him for putting the work in, going to a third season of summer league and entrenching himself as a very solid rotation player in the league in his own right."
Stephen Curry somehow skyfucks the league even more from three.   Kyrie Irving will literally be opponents breaking ankles on his drives.
"I would say because single players can make such a huge difference in basketball, it would make sense to define eras by a few players.  1960s - Bill Russell/Wilt Chamberlain/Jerry West/Oscar Roberson  1970s - Kareem Abdul Jabbar/Bill Walton/Walt Frazier/Dr. Julius Erving  1980s - Magic Johnson/Larry Bird/Isiah Thomas/Moses Malone  1990s - Michael Jordan/Hakeem Olajuwon/Scottie Pippen/Shaq  2000s - Shaq/Kobe Bryant/Tim Duncan/Allen Iverson  2010s - Lebron James/Stephen Curry/Kawhi Leonard/Kevin Durant  2020s - Giannis/Luka Doncic/AD/RJ Barrett"
Steph's actual name is Wardell Stephen Curry II. Seth Curry's actual first name really is Seth though.
"Trae's numbers are nearly identical to Harden's numbers throughout his entire tenure with Houston. I seriously don't know why half the people on reddit claim Trae will never amount to anything, and the other half compare Trae to Steph. Trae is Harden with less defence and better passing. If a front office can build properly around him they have a franchise cornerstone on their hands. Just look at these shooting number profiles:  Harden in Houston (2012-2020):  * **29.6** \- 6.0 - 7.7 on **44/36/86** (61% TS) on **20** FGA, **9** 3PA, **10** FTA  Trae Young (2019-2020):  * **29.6** \- 4.3 - 9.3 on **44/36/86** (59% TS) on **21** FGA, **10** 3PA, **9** FTA  James Harden (2019-2020)  * **34.4** \- 6.4 - 7.4 on **44/35/86** (62% TS) on **23** FGA, **13** 3PA, **12** FTA  *Stephen Curry* *(2012-2020)*  * *25.6 - 4.7 - 6.9 on 48/43/91 (63% TS) on 18 FGA,* *9 3PA, 4.5 FTA*"
Fine. Lebron James and Stephen Curry are not about to get suspended in the NBA finals
Stephen Curry has literally the same qualities
"Kevin Huerter?    Seriously Trae is way more similar to Harden than he is to Steph.  &amp;#x200B;  Harden in Houston (2012-2020):  **29.6** \- 6.0 - 7.7 on **44/36/86** (61% TS) on **20** FGA, **9** 3PA, **10** FTA  Trae Young (2019-2020):  **29.6** \- 4.3 - 9.3 on **44/36/86** (59% TS) on **21** FGA, **10** 3PA, **9** FTA  James Harden (2019-2020)  **34.4** \- 6.4 - 7.4 on **44/35/86** (62% TS) on **23** FGA, **13** 3PA, **12** FTA  *Stephen Curry* *(2012-2020)*  *25.6 - 4.7 - 6.9 on 48/43/91 (63% TS) on 18 FGA,* *9 3PA, 4.5 FTA*"
That Stephen Curry doesn't show up in the playoffs and that he is a playoff choker.   This is so easily disproven its laughable
"My instinctive answer is that this doesn't make sense to me, because any player worth mentioning as an ""almost-GOAT"" will be called the GOAT at least every now and then. I have ABSOLUTELY heard people like Magic, Hakeem and Kareem be called that at least once.  But upon further thought the answer is clear to me: Wardell Stephen Curry II.  Because his skillset changed the game so much and is so different than what we think of in a conventional superstar, he's almost on a different axis. In medieval times, you wouldn't necessarily call the Best Archer in the World the mightiest warrior or whatever. Dunno if that analogy makes sense. I've been watching too much Game of Zones."
"Of course he doesn’t, he’s a big man who are easily doubled in the NBA because they lead to the most basic rotations. He’s still unguardable  and him being assisted doesn’t change that, off ball movement is a skill. Stephen Curry is likely highly assisted, and hes unguardable."
"Not to sound disingenuous, but the importance of Draymond's suspension is a little overblown. There's no way to know the Cavs don't win if Draymond wasn't suspended. The Ray Allen shot, on the other hand, we know that if he misses that shot, they lose, so I'd go with Ray.  If we're being honest, the biggest impact of the 2016 Finals was Stephen Curry underperforming."
You guys want to paint the picture that the stats are so unreliable that someone with a 25% open shot rate will suddenly morph into 50% in actuality. Which is ridiculous.   You just want to gas Stephen Curry. Warriors fans can’t give credit to KD

"Superstar: Very few of them. Very popular, MVP candidates if everything goes their way, All-NBA candidates. Can carry a team. Will always be blamed for a loss.   LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard   Star: Need good players around them to be in contention. Popular, All-Stars. May be blamed for a loss.   Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Pascal Siakam, Dame, Jokic, Lowry, Kemba, etc.   Great player: A lot of players fall into this category. The top of them are borderline all-stars. Very inconsistent or have glaring flaws. Can put up good numbers on a bad team, but are role players on a good team. Can be blamed for a loss, generally won’t.   Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, Jamal Murray, Dlo, Zach LaVine, John Collins, Enes Kanter, Andrew Wiggins, Lonzo Ball, etc   Role players: Do their job and that’s it. Not in All-star contention. Most of the league is this. Can start or come of the bench. Will never be blamed for a loss.   Theis, Chris Boucher, Josh Richardson, Myers Leonard, Terry Rozier, Kuzma, JaMychal Green, etc"
Steve Kerr/Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry!
"I actually had to come back to this post because I realized how ridiculous this whole conversation was.   Harden had All Time Great spacing as well. Curry and Klay being there obviously provide that, but do people not realize that even they can’t compete with an actual 5 out? Durant had two non shooters on the court at all times. Harden had 1 and often times, none.   And this is important when we are discussing isolation scorers. To excuse a 10% TS difference with “muh muh Stephen Curry” is completely ridiculous   This sub is so stupid right now I can’t believe that this was a discussion."

Stephen Curry and Heremy Lin are like the two most Christian players I remember
"And these casual fans watching Harden on Instagram and hating him, calling him foul baiting, selfish ball hog. He's a generational talent like Stephen Curry, and like Curry's quick release long range threes, he has made Stepbacks a norm (though step backs existed before, but Harden do it in his unique way, and has almost perfected it)"

Melo has just hit 2 3s.    Not even Stephen Curry is expected to hit ALL his 3s
I have to find the article or link. But I think Phil Jackson mentioned how good Mahmoud was during an interview. He was asked by the reporter if he had ever seen someone score the way Steph Curry could. I believe this was around 2016.  Edit: found it. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2620432-phil-jackson-compares-stephen-curry-to-mahmoud-abdul-rauf
Your so focused on LeBron that you forgot about all the other  players bitching out and saying no comment. Now that's a pussy move. At least LeBron had the balls to come out and say what he felt. I still remember James Harden and Stephen Curry were not educated enough to comment on the situation lmao that's a thousand times worse.
Then Ben Simmons must be a transcendent player considering Lonzo is Stephen Curry with a 40 INCH VERTICAL!!!
Why don't they trade for Stephen Curry?

Warriors would be close to the top   * Stephen Curry  * Wilt Chamberlain * Draymond Green  * Klay Thompson  * Jason Richardson  * Penny Hardway
How? My position has always been the same. Playing 6 games isn't enough to say you were the teams best player for that year. Stephen Curry had no impact on the Warriors record this year.

"I'll copy a comment I made a few days ago on this topic:  ""Overall consensus on this site is quite anti-Bbalbreakdown, considering most of the threads I have read about his videos.  The main complaint people have is that his videos have turned from analytical and in-depth (from around 2009 to 2016) to clickbaity and run-of-the-mill. Once his channel grew and he had a lot of subscribers, he started introducing ads and he started using loud and annoying music that makes his videos appear more epic and dramatic. What that tries to mask is the fact that instead of the game analysis, with examples, set play analysis, weekly court call, statistical analysis (combined with film analysis) and so on, the things that made him THE best basketball-related Youtuber back in the day, he has turned to basic commentary on highlights and making simple, low-level statements that don't really mean anything.  He has turned from a Thinking Basketball type channel into almost a First Take talking head, because he realized that the best way to grow his channel is to appeal to the lowest common denominator: instead of his videos being geared towards a deeper, true understanding of basketball (as opposed to the generalized nonsense that people like Skip and Stephen A were spouting out back in the day), he started making videos for the average fan, videos which don't actually have any real value.  It's not that he doesn't put out great content anymore. His playoff analysis last year was mostly good, for example. But those videos are few and far between. Compare his last few videos to the ones he made about the 2012 NBA Finals, or the 2015 NBA Finals (""Why Matthew Dellevedova is outplaying Steph Curry"", ""Why the Cavs are terrible with LeBron on the bench""), or even the 2016 NBA Finals (""What happened to Steph Curry in the NBA Finals""). The difference is staggering. He doesn't do analysis of old, classic NBA games anymore, since he realized that he doesn't get as many views on them from very casual fans. He doesn't do in-depth team analysis based on Synergy stats and so on, since, again, he doesn't get the same involvement from people who have a marginal understanding of basketball.  There are other complaints he faces, mainly that he is stubborn in his opinions, he prefers a specific style of basketball and that he's a ""hater"", but those aren't good complaints in my view since he's always been that way. He was never a fan of Kobe or Westbrook or Pau Gasol or Scott Brooks or even Mo Williams back in the day. That's just how he is."""
Backlash comes from repeatedly stating unpopular views.  I think curry streamed a talk with an astronaut afterwards and tried to educate himself in public.  Desean Jackson got less heat than stephen jackson because desean showed signs of educating himself. Did Desean change his beliefs? No idea.  I've swear I heard kyrie defend his position multiple times even after people said he was trolling.   I think kyrie was one of the earliest athletes to talk about flat earth. He also was a surprise because he was known for being a good speaker.
the santa cruz warriors with 6 games from stephen curry and draymond green and 5 of klay thompson. if they didn't want such a shitty bench maybe they shouldn't have signed kevin durant
"Stephen Curry no question and if anyone thinks differently they're just wrong. Curry has a higher career 3pt% of 43.5%, Allen and Miller are only 40%, and that's with Curry having far more 3PA than those 2, and higher difficulty of shots. Shots off the dribble, from the logo, with defenders in his face, 30 foot stepbacks, on ball, off ball, Curry does it all. Ray Allen and Reggie Miller mostly played off-ball catch and shoot style like Klay Thompson. Curry's assisted 3pt% has been in the 60-70%, his MVP seasons were actually below 60% at 58% and 55%. Allen and Miller's 3's were 80-90% assisted, especially later in Allen's career where he won championships.   And to people who say ""Oh Reggie Miller would have taken and made the same amount of 3s as Steph in today's era"", if they were Soo much better than Curry at shooting, why didn't the game change in their time? If Reggie Miller was so good at it, people would have saw that and the league would already have changed to the 3pt era but it didn't, because Curry is so much better than them only he was able to change the league like that. It was Curry who used the 3pt shot as a weapon to win championships and build a dynasty, that is what makes him the greatest shooter of all time."
&gt;I think that Stephen Curry is the best player of all time for sure
"I know right, they just can’t accept that Stephen Curry is a good player."

Stephen Curry- drafted 2009. Thibs joined wolves as coach 2016? Was he part of the wolves draft process in between his Celtics and Bulls gigs?
"I'm completely on the Jordan side but this isn't the best argument. It could just mean he played on better teams or played weaker opponents. Or both.  When you simply the game to just team success people can easily poke holes in your argument.  Someone could say ""Stephen  Curry didn't need a game 7 to win a title and has a better finals record does that make him better than Lebron too?""."

"Jesus Christ.   I already PROVIDED the YEARS that Durants OFFENSIVE ON OFF out classed Steph. You are literally linking and using on off statistics to prove a player better than another.   You used advanced analytic impact stats that I already critiqued! You have NOT ONCE even acknowledge my fair critique on them ! When I mentioned the players that perform better than Klay on these same statistics, you again ignored it. When I mentioned how these stats are influenced by LINEUPS, you AGAIN, ignored it.   Durant is better, has been better, won TWO FINALS MVP OVER HIM, has MORE ACCOLADES, and was COMPLETELY 10x the player Stephen Curry was prior to 2015. And was still better in 15 despite his foot injury if we compare it to his 2014 season.   No one in their RIGHT MIND would rank Curry’s 2015 MVP season over KDs 2014. Literally no one. Yet that’s what you are trying to convince me, along with the bullshit about Curry being a better defender. Stop guy."
You spammed advanced analytics that you didn’t understand and tried to convince me that Stephen Curry was now a better defensive player than Kevin Durant because on/off told you so.   Did you think I was actually going to continue and take you serious??
"He *thinks* he plays in OKC, but clearly he's not sure. Probably got confused since Thunder is the Warriors old mascot.

"Klay Thompson's career high is 3.5 3's per game.   To put that in perspective...Stephen Curry has equaled or surpassed that 6 times in his career while simultaneously being more efficient and more heavily defended by opposing defenses.   Yea, you really can't make an argument that Klay is in Steph's league."
"&gt;not Warriors level for sure but absolutely a decent lineup surrounding an all-nba player.  You don't understand the idiocy of this statement do you? Not only was that lineup not even close to Warriors level, you're completely ignoring how Stephen Curry is unanimously considered an all-time great despite the even more stacked talent around him. How can you knock Harden for having ""great"" teams while also acknowledging his teams weren't up to par with competition?"
Stephen Curry has mamba mentality tho
Free Vanvleet swears he is Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry would laugh at that shot that's how bad that shot was
"[during the all star game a few years ago they were shooting some 3s for charity and invited curry on to the court to make some half court shots for charity, Steph goes 0/5. This gave birth to the meme that he hates charity](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-stephen-curry-had-the-all-star-stage-and-it-got-awkward-really-fast/)"
"Our best player was 37 years old and its not like the Spurs were sitting in the lottery all those years Miami was going to the finals, apart from the 2011 upset the Spurs were playing deep into the playoffs every year too.  Wade just fell off a cliff and I'd take that team in their finals form over any finals team in NBA history (no bias of course). 2014 Patty Thrills &gt; any version of Stephen Curry imho."
"Just googled it. Says 6’5. Luka Doncic, 6’7. Stephen curry. A mere 6’3. There’s no excuses here"

"Yeah I would have liked for Coach Bud to run some plays for giannis. He can't be the main ball handler versus a team that has the personnel to stop him. Versus the magic they tried a similar thing in limiting his transition scoring and walling up, but he still averaged 31 against them. This time he can't get to the paint at will (except for game 4 where he dropped 19 before getting injured) against the Heat. Run  some PNRs, get him closer to the basket, do something instead of trying to make him run through 4 Heat Jerseys at the top of the key. You want to hide your player's weaknesses. Harden has to do at least something when he gets doubled instead of standing near the NBA logo until his teammates burp up a shot. You don't have to be stephen curry offball but at least get in position for a catch and shoot three or cut to the basket."
"THat's just a completely different offense than what Houston runs.  The rest of the team needs to learn how to take advantage of a 4on3 after the pass out, instead of continuing to sit behind the 3P line.  This is a coaching issue more than a Harden issue.  [Look at how GS takes advantage of doubles on Curry.  It has nothing to do with Curry moving off ball.  The buckets are created by the other guys immediately playing 4on3](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2014/4/20/5632978/golden-state-warriors-playoffs-clippers-film-room-stephen-curry)"
"Honestly, I watched the videos on this [page](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2014/4/20/5632978/golden-state-warriors-playoffs-clippers-film-room-stephen-curry) and most of the time curry passes out of the double he just stands there afterwards (and curry is one of the best off ball movers in the game)."
"Stephen Curry gets defended the same way moron, he still gets buckets . Harden is not the only superstar to get doubled."
Looks almost like a repeat of the Durant situation.  Everything is lining up for the Warriors.  Matching salaries with Wiggins and lots of good assets to offer.  Joey Lightyears may strike again. They are going to trot out:  * Stephen Curry * Klay Thompson * Marquese Chriss * Draymond Green * Giannis Antetokounmpo
Kyries gotten insanely close to a 50/40/90 year and u mentioned kyrie only averaging 24+ ppg twice in his career and drose has only done once. And I agree with Stephen curry and maybe cp3 being more efficient than kyrie but kyle lowry and damian Lillard? Really? Those 2 are volume shooters that's 1 and incredibly streaky. And comparing klay to jimmy is nothing like comparing kyrie to Derrick rose. You act as if Kyries ONLY great attribute is shooting. Kyrie is much more crafty than drose and his finish ability rivals derrick roses. Kyries become crazy underrated this past year cuz he acts like a bitch 🤣🤣 but people are seriously starting to forget how great of basketball player he is.
&gt; He's not a great isolation threat  You have no idea why you are talking about. Currys isolation efficieny is almost dead even with kd.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-will-miss-kevin-durants-lethal-iso-game-but-history-shows-stephen-curry-can-dominate-in-same-way/

Stephen Curry can teach him how to avoid ankle injuries 😏
It is kind of scary if you think about it.  Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry providing all that spacing for Giannis.  How do you even defend the Greek Curry PnR?
Will the Warriors be better with Giannis than with KD?  We could be looking at a GSW starting lineup of:  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Draymond Green  Klay Thompson  Stephen Curry  Marc Gasol  Looks pretty scary on paper.

The reality is that Irving wasn’t just good this season, and he wasn’t just great. He was historic as he tallied averages of 23.8 points per game and a career-best 6.9 assists per game while shooting 48.7 percent from the floor and 40.1 percent from long range.  Yes, he was the only player to reach the numbers outlined above this season, but that’s only the tip of this statistical iceberg. There is far more gravity to this story. Let’s walk up the ladder of significance.  There are now two names in the Boston Celtics history book that have recorded a 23-6-48-40 season. One is Irving. The other is Larry Bird, who accomplished the feat four times.  There are only four names in the NBA’s history book that have recorded such a season. One is Irving. The others are Bird (four times), Stephen Curry (three times) and LeBron James (one time).”"

"Matt Moore had a good article on this and this quote at the end stuck out to me    Preface: ““Bud believes in his system,” one league executive told The Action Network. “Coaches have to believe in their system in order to implement it, but then it becomes this anchor they’ve tied themselves to.””  Here the two big parts   1) “Some guys define how they play vs. the way they play, and those teams often times have more playoff success”  2) “I once asked George Karl if he’d rather win by adapting his style to the demands of consensus or lose playing his way. He told me he’d rather lose by playing his way.  It was a sign of how much he believed in his ideas and philosophies. Karl won 1,175 games as an NBA coach with a 59% winning percentage and a NBA Finals appearance.  He told me that before his first playoff series against Stephen Curry and the Golden Warriors in 2013.  The Nuggets lost as a favorite in six games”"

Wow. Og is better than stephen curry.
"Unlikely that he will.  If the Bucks get the broom treatment, it is not out of the realm of possibility.

Ask Steve Kerr just how invaluable and instrumental Steve Nash has been in the Warriors dynasty. Ask Stephen Curry. Ask Jerry freaking West.   Kerr also had no HC experience FYI.
Thats what you get when you don't go by Steve. Stephen Curry is gonna realize this later in life.
"So he has inarguably top 5 longevity ever and a top 15 peak ever but he’s only “top 15?” How does that work? The early 90s wasn’t even his peak as a player. He generally underperformed in the postseason quite often, especially in the early 90s. In the mid-late 90s he added range to his jumper and it made him a more complete offensive player and generally a better postseason performer. Posting just regular season PPG and RPG barely means anything. I don’t think anyone argues that 1987 was Michael Jordan’s peak, so I don’t see why the early 90s would be Karl’s peak. I can list 15+ players that have equal or close equal peaks to Malone, in no particular order:  1. 1990-91 Michael Jordan 2. 2008-09 LeBron James 3. 1992-93 Hakeem Olajuwon 4. 1999-00 Shaquille O’Neal 5. 1976-77 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 6. 2003-04 Kevin Garnett 7. 1966-67 Wilt Chamberlain 8. 1961-62 Bill Russell 9. 2015-16 Stephen Curry 10. 1985-86 Larry Bird 11. 1986-87 Magic Johnson 12. 1965-66 Jerry West 13. 1963-64 Oscar Robertson 14. 2007-08 Kobe Bryant 15. 2008-09 Dwyane Wade 16. 2006-07 Steve Nash 17. 1976-77 Bill Walton 18. 1990-91 David Robinson 19. 2016-17 Kevin Durant 20. 2016-17 Kawhi Leonard 21. 2002-03 Tim Duncan 22. 2010-11 Dirk Nowitzki 23. 1975-76 Julius Erving 24. 2014-15 Chris Paul 25. 2002-03 Tracy McGrady 26. 1989-90 Charles Barkley 27. 1982-83 Moses Malone 28. 1989-90 Patrick Ewing  Karl Malone may be better than some of these players but I don’t see how he is definitively better than 13+ of these guys all at their peaks.

"Yea and Raymond Felton is basically Stephen Curry minus the skill, and pretty much everything else"
"&gt;And TP was injured in both 2013-2014 finals  Idk where you are you getting your facts but TP was healthy in both and was the lead scorer in 14 finals for the spurs and second in 13 finals to old tim duncan for the spurs.   &gt;Irving is like a guaranteed 25-30ppg scorer, he outplayed Stephen Curry in the 2016 finals when they came back.  I think its hilarious how you stopped mentioning Kevin Love when it came time to mention people's finals play but yeah ""Stacked"". So now you are asking if I want Old Tim Duncan, Manu, and TP or Kyrie. Like I said previously every day of the week.   &gt;SA was 1st, 2nd round &amp; out before Kahwi  This is my original point if any of those three guys could join a team that makes it to the 2nd round without them they would turn them into championship team which Kawhi did. I just dont think it proved he is the best player especially when you take into it the finals injury luck.   Like I said in my original comment, Kawhi has his chance to prove it this year and so far in these playoffs he has."
Comparing the skill set of players like Russell and Wilt to players of today is clearly impossible.   But I easily don’t think in terms of skill there is a “huge difference” between someone like Kobe and someone like Durant. Or even someone like Magic and Stephen Curry. Or prime KG and Duncan.

"Irving is like a guaranteed 25-30ppg scorer, he outplayed Stephen Curry in the 2016 finals when they came back.  You'd really trade him for a Duncan-Manu combo that only plays 20-30mpg?  You're going to have to play large spans without them.  And TP was injured in both 2013-2014 finals against the Heat leading to Kawhis breakout, SA was incredibly average before Kahwi took over &amp; turned them into what you saw in 2014, nearly did it in 2013 too.    SA was 1st, 2nd round &amp; out before Kahwi, with devastating losses like to the 8th seed Grizz &amp; a badly aged core capable of playing 2 1/2 quarters a game.  Also Lionel Hollins, Alvin Gentry, Carlisle, Rivers, &amp; Billy Donovan have all ran circles around Pop before.  In fact Lionel Hollins specifically targeted the Spurs when they upset them as the 8th seed.  Pop treated the MJ of our generation like a Bruce Bowen lol think about that."
"The Nuggets are a good team, just not a championship caliber team though they still have a lot of potential so the future is bright for you guys in Denver. The NBA is pretty simple really compared to other sports leagues. The league is split up into two conferences, the western conference and the eastern conference. Which teams are which are pretty explanatory but if you ever need to check you can always just google it. But for reference the western-most Eastern Conference team is the Milwaukee Bucks and the eastern-most Western Conference team is either the Memphis Grizzles or the New Orleans Pelicans. There's 30 teams in the NBA, 15 in each conference. 29 of the teams are in the continental United States but 1 team, the Raptors, play in Toronto. The season is normally 82 games long, and only the top 8 teams of each conference make it to the playoffs. Basketball just like any other American sport has an all-star game which is actually stretched out to an all star weekend and involves the dunk contest, 3 point contest, a skills challenge, a celebrity game, and sort of lesser version of the all-star game for young rising stars (and also obviously a traditional all-star game). The playoffs are in 4 rounds. There is a 1st round, 2nd round or semi-conference finals, the conference finals (3rd round), and then the NBA finals. Each series is best of 7, so a team has to win 4 games to move on to the next round. If a team wins a series 4-0 that's called a sweep, and if a series is won 4-1 that's called a gentlemen's sweep. There are two different mvp awards, the regular season mvp and the finals mvp. The regular season mvp is given to the person who performed the best that season though the award is often biased to players on the top teams in the league. The finals mvp is awarded to the best performing player on the winning team, and though this is rare it can also be given to a player on the losing team under extraordinary circumstances. Though I have a feeling something like that will never happen again. The consensus two best teams at the moment are actually both from Los Angeles, they're the Lakers and the Clippers. The Bucks are often considered the 3rd best team, mostly because of their star Giannis Antetokounmpo who is on his way to being the best player in the league if he isn't it already. And he has the potential to be the most dominant player of all time. The other candidate for best in the league are Kawhi Leonard, who won a championship last year with the Raptors and was finals mvp, and LeBron James, a man who's easily a top 5 player in NBA history. Some would even say the greatest player of all time (GOAT), though I wouldn't. Another key fact about Lebron is that he's older then most NBA players. He's in his 17th season and is 35 years old which doesn't sound like much but that's pretty old for an NBA player. He's certainly not in his prime anymore but the fact that he's still arguable the best player in the league at an age where most NBA players would be retired is insane. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry would also be on the list of best players in the league if they weren't injured. So barring injuries the top 5 players in league (not in any particular order) are LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard , Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant. With an honorable mention to James Harden, who I would put at number 6, though some would disagree. I already wrote an essay so I'll leave it as this. Lmk if have any questions!"

Stephen Curry. He literally changed the game and had a heavy influence on the next generation of stars yet he is treated as a 2nd tier star by fans who seem to have forgotten about him.
32 made 3 pointers in a playoff series against OKC in 2016. Curry had 32 and Klay Thompson had 30. Both broke the previous record of 28 made-pointers.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2643340-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-break-nba-playoff-record-for-most-3s-in-a-series  Mitchell &amp; Murray each currently have 31 made 3-pointers.
"If you think the only argument Curry stans have is “he shoot good,” (and don’t get me wrong, he’s one of the best we’ve ever seen), then I suggest learning some more about it. He was [arguably the most important player on the all-time great KD teams](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/) — he’s an incredible facilitator, one of the most relentless off-ball threats the league has ever seen (watch what he does when he doesn’t have the ball on a possession), and, because we have to get into it sometime, a three-time champ. That’s a function of the pieces put around him, to be sure, but by all accounts he allows himself to he coached like a bench player and has very little ego w.r.t. teammates.   CP3 is the prototype of the classic point guard, but he’s not a revelation like Curry was (and is)."
Won't need to if he joins Stephen Curry or Luka Doncic.
"Though you’re wrong, I appreciate you not even saying 30’s name here. Because Chris Paul and Stephen Curry don’t even belong in the same sentence."
Dude seriously.. people act like Stephen Curry missed significant time every season when it was really just in the 2011-2012 season.

"Stephen ""Burger Murray"" Curry"
Jamal “Stephen Curry” Murray
This game brought to you by Stephen Curry
Stephen Curry was master-class at this.
When Jamal Murray looks like prime Stephen Curry you know there's something wrong with the defense
"Are you referring to two time MVP, three time champion, Stephen Curry? Hopefully Luka someday will get out of the first round..."
"Do you think that Luka would be cool being the 2nd option? Most of the time when super teams are formed the existing members had already proven they can win a championship as the first option, ex: Dwayne Wade and Stephen Curry."
"Also Wolves execs: “I’m telling you, Jonny Flynn was better than Stephen Curry when we drafted him...”"
"Lmfao the Blazers are fun, but you will never win with a point guard as your best player unless your name is Stephen Curry, and even he needed to be hidden on defense and surrounded by great complementary pieces.   Lillard isn’t as good, and in honestly extremely overrated. He had an absolutely stellar performance against OKC in 2019, but has been pretty terrible otherwise in the playoffs. Besides that series win, they have won a total of 5 playoff wins in the last 4 seasons and 4 of them were against Denver last year.   I don’t understand why people ever thought this series was going 7. The Lakers went up 6 in game 1, and they were playing absolutely awful offensively and Lillard had to enter robot mode."
"Actually he went through:  Round 1: Nikola Vucevic   Round 2: Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons   ECF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton   Finals: Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson   It’s still 8 players, but he wasn’t the only all-star on his team"
"Did i not type it in clear enough English? Wardell Stephen Curry still has question marks surrounding him on whether or not he can lead his team to a title....in my opinion. 2015, his team beat a Cavs team without Love or Irving. They lost in 2016 against a healthy Cavs team. 2017 and 2018, they had KD...who imo did a majority of the carrying in their 2 championship series (also took home two finals MVPs as proof). KD is gone now, which means Curry has time to prove to me that he can carry a team over the top because i'm still not convinced."
"At least the Kings only whiffed once. Imagine having two lottery picks, drafting two point guards in a row, and neither one is Stephen Curry."
Stephen Curry  Ray Allen  Kevin Durant  Chris Bosh  Tim Duncan
what about stephen curry with a 40 inch vertical?
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, David West &gt; Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Mario Chalmers, Udonis Haslem....Joel Anthony, Mike Miller????   Like it’s not even close lmao"
The guy who beat Lebron the most in the final? Stephen Curry.
"I hate Durant more than anybody. That little skinny crackhead twig (seriously that's why he doesn't have any stupid tatts on his arm because YOU CAN'T PUT TATTOOS ON TWIGS)...Durant called out Lebron in 2010 for leaving his crappy, poorly managed Cavs roster to play with his best friends, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Lebron didn't join Boston's big 3 for an even easier championship. That 2009-2010 Heat finished 5th in the standings, not 1st with the all-time best regular season record of 73 wins including having just won a championship the season prior. So after chastising Lebron, Durant does the SAME EXACT THING BUT A WHOLE LOT WORSE by joining a championship team and riding off the coat tails of that championship-built team to get two very easy rings. Then, being the sensitive little prick that he is, Durant gets in a little skirmish with Draymond who calls him out, just being honest. And Durant already has his mind made up that he wants to leave Golden State because his feelings are hurt, even though the far important player Curry didn't even get a chance to persuade him.  Steph Curry is the ultimate consummate professional and teammate. He sacrificed his game a bit to welcome Durant. Curry will always have more rings than Durant, you can bet your mind on that. That Nets team looks incredibly chaotic. No real defensive players, just two major egos in Durant and Kyrie who will likely hate each other after a season or two. Neither is a leader. How they think that both of them coming from prolonged injuries past their prime will result in a functional formidable team is beyond me. Both have lots to prove. Kyrie is an evader, he left Boston like a coward after claiming they would so much better in the playoffs because they had him in 2019. Durant is lucky he had Curry and Klay. Otherwise, he'd never been Lebron James as shown when he had his own team in the 2012 NBA Finals. Durant is a bus rider and he'll probably cry about it on Twitter as Stephen Jackson most sensitive of all time. He's a hypocrite and a fake superstar."
"Tier 1: Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard  Tier 2: James Harden, Nikola Jokic, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo  Tier 3: Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Jayson Tatum  Players in each tier are in in no order"

"In a post-game chat with Green, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, Bryant encouraged the Warriors' stars to continue charging toward a place in NBA lore, according to Baxter Holmes of ESPN.com:  ""You guys have got to go ahead and make history,"" Bryant told Curry.  ""I got to chase you,"" Curry replied, a response that Bryant said he too would have used.  ""Damn right,"" Bryant told Curry. ""Absolutely.

"Doesn’t even like Lebron that much, but defends like a fanboy and continues to provide more excuses.   With Phil and Pippen, they weren’t even accomplished till they started winning with Jordan. LeBron has to join an accomplished franchise with a player who had a chip already along with another franchise player. Tell me, who was Phil and Pippen before they started winning? You only knew Jordan and his teammates because they won, for LeBron, you gotta give him excuses and trash his teammates to validate your points, forgetting he played with All-Stars.  And old stars? Magic was 31 when he retired, Isiah was 30 when he lost to Jordan in 91. If they’re considered old then Stephen Curry, James Harden and Kevin Durant must be old and retiring as well. I think by old teams, you were referring to the Spurs and Boston Celtics.  Yeah he won 2016, but then they lost the motivation suddenly to stay on top right? Being the juggernaut team that everyone targeted was so easy for him after winning right? I remember Jordan doing that 3 times in a row... twice I might add."
"Stephen A is 100% correct here.  Like Steph Curry ended up in the absolute perfect era for 3s, Lebron ended up in the absolute perfect era when the league downsized."
"The Heat were running the pick and roll defense the Kerr used with Curry on LeBron from 2017. LeBron got better at attacking it in the 2018 Finals (especially in Game 1), he had to learn the weak points. The Warriors threw a lot at him (for those of you who think Kerr is just along for the ride) so he’s seen it all by now.  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2017/5/30/15716160/nba-2017-playoffs-analysis-the-new-way-stephen-curry-defends-lebron-james  Original article seems to be gone but a brief excerpt is here.

"Kerr is smart, but he was gifted Stephen curry entering his prime, Solid 18-20ppg Klay, Draymond before the Triple Singles, and the Ability to get durant from Draymond's ""Convincing"""
"&gt;That OKC game where he pulled up from almost half court to splash a three with Mike Breen's classic ""BANG BAANG"" is what I'll always think of when I think Stephen Curry  Don't forget Enes Kanters reaction"
"Good post! This is the same strategy the Warriors started to employ with Steph Curry after losing in 2016, probably where they adapted it from.  https://www.letsgowarriors.com/p/the-new-way-stephen-curry-defends  Of course the problem is that Lebron spent two finals seeing that defensive scheme!"
"Stephen Curry with the SHOT, that’s some wet ass perimetershooting"
"Yeah I'd believe you if you look at NBA AND ABA ranking, Michael Jordan sits at #33 and Tony Parker #35, if they were up there in the top 20 I'd believe you Dwade sits at #19 and Lebron has 1098 more turnovers and counting.  Stephen Curry ranks at #95 Vince Carter at #51 and Miami's own Goran Dragic at #154.  Lebron surpassed Kobe by 514 turnovers, if you divide that over the total years Lebron has played (16 years) that's 32 more turnovers per year than Kobe did.. Its 2.5 turnovers more than Kobe per game (82 matches per season)."
"""If""?  Bro they have fucking Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson"
"Before everyone chimes in with reasons why they think NBA popularity is declining let's get the facts. Harris recently did a poll asking why NBA fans are less interested than they used to be. Here are the results:  &gt; By Kurt Badenhausen | Forbes  &gt; Basketball fans are souring on the NBA’s support of teams and players bringing politics onto the court, tossing an assist to President Donald Trump in his attacks on the league.  &gt; “People are tired of watching the highly political @NBA. Basketball ratings are WAY down, and they won’t be coming back. I hope football and baseball are watching and learning because the same thing will be happening to them. Stand tall for our Country and our Flag!!!” Trump tweeted to his 86 million followers yesterday.  &gt; A new Harris Poll backs Trump’s critique of the NBA, with 39% of sports fans saying they are watching fewer games. And the chief reason why? Politics. The longtime polling agency surveyed nearly 2,000 people over the weekend and gave people ten options to choose from on why they are watching less basketball.  &gt; **“The league has become too political” was the clear choice for the decline, with 38% of respondents. “Boring without fans” captured 28% of the vote while the NBA’s association with China caused 19% of sports fans to turn the dial**, another nod to a league Trump labeled a “political organization” last week after players boycotted games in response to a police officer shooting Jacob Blake seven times in the back in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  &gt; NBA ratings are in fact down overall through the first round of the playoffs compared with last year, but it’s hardly an apples-to-apples comparison. Summer TV viewership typically lags springtime watching, when the playoffs are normally aired. This year, the overall numbers are skewed by the need to air games during the day to accommodate a playoff calendar that has been condensed because of the pandemic. Ratings are up over last year’s playoffs for the games that have aired in prime time.  &gt; “While the data shows the league’s political leanings will undoubtedly cause some not to watch, the NBA is balancing the issue of racial injustice, supporting its players and completing a successful finish to the season,” says John Gerzema, the Harris Poll CEO. “The basketball bubble has kept the league immune from cases of (Covid) infection but not immune from the impact politics can have on ratings and public sentiment.”  &gt; Trump and the NBA’s star players have been at odds since he took office in 2017. It’s a tradition for teams that win championships to visit the White House, but the Golden State Warriors, who won the 2017 NBA Finals, followed the lead of their star Stephen Curry and refused to visit. Trump quickly withdrew the invitation after the slight. LeBron James has called Trump a “bum,” and Trump targeted James after the four-time MVP appeared on CNN discussing the opening of his charter school.  &gt; The responses on why people are watching fewer games tilted based on party affiliation, not surprisingly. Fifty-seven percent of Republicans choose “too political” and 36% selected China as reasons they watched fewer games; the corresponding figures among Democrats were 22% and 8%. (Respondents could select more than one answer.)  &gt; Harris also found the NBA is more partisan than any other sport. Only 34% of Republicans say they “actively follow” the NBA, compared with 48% of Democrats. The gap of 14 percentage points is the largest of any sport. For comparison, 54% of Democrats actively follow the NFL versus 51% of Republicans.  https://theharrispoll.com/poll-38-of-sports-fans-say-nba-is-too-political-as-reason-they-are-watching-less/"
"So you’re literally proving my point LMAO. He is singled out for things that aren’t associated with what’s going on the court DESPITE us discussing ... what’s going on on the court. This is basketball.   I’ve already refuted it. It doesn’t matter how he got to the team or what he said. It’s about his play on the court being downplayed because of his team being dominant. The simple fact of the matter is 1.) there are dominant teams every year. And 2.) he played EXTREMELY well from a basketball perspective. You are trying to relate “hardest road” quotes and him joining the Warriors as a way to downplay the basketball portion of the argument.   Lying about stats won’t help you.  **Stephen Curry open shot frequency 17 Finals- 57.%. LeBron James open shot frequency - 52%**  So not only have you proven to me you don’t know basketball, you add the cherry on top by literally lying about statistics that are easily available to anyone.   So no, again, Durant took less open shots as he usually does in comparison to any superstars on any team.   But after getting exposed for literally lying about stats, I doubt I’ll get another response from you. Next time do some research.   Avoiding logical what ifs as a way to strip context out of ball is stupid. Whatever team came out the West was going to be more talented than the weaker eastern conference and you know that.   Do some research."
Here are some other current notable players and their last 100 playoff games:  Kevin Durant: **29.5 - 7.6 - 4.3** \- 1.0 - 1.2 (59.8% TS)  Stephen Curry: **26.9 - 5.6 - 6.1** \- 1.6 - 0.3 (61.5% TS)  James Harden: **26.5 - 5.6 - 6.5** \- 1.8 - 0.5 (57.8% TS)  Kawhi Leonard: **22.7 - 8.1 - 3.1** \- 1.9 - 0.7 (61.4% TS)  Russell Westbrook: **25.1 - 7.1 - 7.8** \- 1.9 - 0.3 (50.7% TS)
"This is always ridiculous. Call Jimmy the ""star"" on a team, and make Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh his side kicks, and you think he couldn't win? Make Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love his side kicks, and you think he can't win? Make Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson side kicks, and you think he can't win?   This criticism is always stupid. Put a Top 10 player like Jimmy with other Top 10 players like some of the other Top 10 players get to do, and you will probably win a championship with him."

"the clippers do not improve in that trade, doesn't solve their ballhandling problem without them making other moves, kawhi doesnt not have the gravity of stephen curry that allows thompson to be effective without ever having to dribble the ball"
Sure. Also Stephen Marbury and Eddy Curry to complete the recipe of success.
Stephen curry
"Nope, any superstar level player is gonna look great playing next to the two greatest shooters of all time. Stephen curry, like lebron, has a certain gravity on the offensive end. Curry draws the defenses attention so much that other offensive players are better when he’s on the floor. Then you add in another great shooter like Klay, who also draws the defense, scoring for any superstar becomes a walk in the park. If you’re gonna say that KD was better than lebron at any point because of his play on the warriors, then I’d expect you to believe that AD is the 1st or 2nd best player in the world right now, which obviously isn’t the case"

"&gt; I’m not saying I agree with the other guy but when did this revisionist history say that Steph and Klay were injured?

Playing through injury doesn't mean they weren't effected by them smh, and they were clearly off in the Finals showing wear.   &gt; Also Draymond hit the technical limit which is why he was suspended so there was no petitioning about it.   It was upgraded outside the game and Lebron did petition the NBA to do so, and of course they did because they wanted to make sure the series was interesting and to prop up Lebron.  &gt; [“LeBron probably made the call,” one Warrior said of the decision announced by the NBA office on Sunday. &gt; Another asked, and then answered, his question: “What do you think would have happened if the players involved were reversed? I think we all know.”](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-lebron-probably-made-call-green-suspension)  &gt;-[""I don't know what should happen. It's not my call.

It wasn't and the league gave him huge help throughout with reffing and suspending Draymond on that weak foul that was upgraded. That was some serious bullshit, and no I'm no Warriors fan."
"Ehh I see this a lot (in general, not just for Curry) but I'm not sure if there's any real backing to it.  I think everyone's game relies on their athleticism. Athleticism isn't just explosive dunks, but things like speed, quickness, stamina, endurance, etc.  Being a half second slower can be a huge difference regardless of how fast you were before.  He's not going to fall off a cliff, but I don't think it's a guarantee we'll see back-to-back MVP Stephen Curry next season and going forward."
Why wouldn’t the golden state warriors with Stephen Curry want a top 3 PG in the league

Kellerman saying he’d rather Andre Iguodala take the last shots over Stephen Curry in 2019.
"I think a lack of a facilitator might be more of a problem for them, Kyrie played best with a all time great facilitator Lebron james and Kd also played with a great facilitator like stephen curry. This worked because lebron and curry let them both just focus on scoring. Kyrie is more of a sg on offense so in boston when he ran point they struggled on offense at times and kd has never ran point ever. They might struggle with creating for others on the team which lead to a stagnant offense like the clippers this year."
"I don't know why we wouldn't? I've been a die hard warriors fan for 20 years (32), Lacob is the best thing to ever happen to this team with the exception of Stephen Curry and even then I still might take Lacob.  &amp;#x200B;  Having an owner whose priority is winning is an absolutely wonderful thing to have in a team.  &amp;#x200B;  It sucks that fans, like myself and others, probably got priced out of seeing them in person, but I'll take getting priced out if it means I can watch a contender every year."
Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry are showing why Lakers need to improve backcourt
"Steph didn't dominate anything in the 2010s.   Lebron has since 2010-11 season:  * 9 NBA finals * 3 NBA titles * 2x MVP * 3x Finals MVPs * 10 All-NBA teams (9 1st team, 1 3rd team) * 3x all defense * 1 assists title  Averaged:  26.5 PPG, 7.7 assist 7.7 rebounds, 1.5 SPG and .7 blocks on 60.6 TS%  Stephen Curry has:  * 5 NBA Finals * 3 NBA titles * 0 Finals MVP * 1 scoring title * 1 steals title * 6 All-NBA (3 1st, 2nd, 1 3rd)  23.4 PPG, 6.5 assists, 4.5 rb, 1.6 stls and .3 blocks on 62% TS%  Lebron has just as many titles and didn't need to recruit Durant to keep winning.  He also dominated statistically in conventional and advanced stats."
It still works if you change the title “After G4 of the 18’ Finals Stephen Curry tells Lebron it’s going to be his league in a little while.”
"Right, but at least it's Wardell Stephen Curry. Not comparable"

"Who do you think is the best player in the league is, and why is it Stephen Curry?"
"It’s unfair to use the Curry/KD had more help argument.  They were originally successful because of Stephen Curry.  Their strength in numbers is a line the warriors use but in reality their bench has been their biggest weakness.   Also, a lot of the guys such as Ezeli, Mo Speights, Ian Clark, Brandon Rush, Quinn Cook, Varejao, Jordan Bell, Jerebko etc are guys who vanished right after playing with the warriors.  What teams do those guys play for?   Yes, they had talent but don’t get it twisted.  It starts and ends with Stephen Curry.   (Side note: I love when people say Draymond, Iguodala, and Klay are great role players but change their narrative when they want to say how stacked the warriors were...then they become legit all stars)  Smh"
But you support a failed billionaire? Who pays 70k a year for haircut ? Or opens Casinos after the one before fails ? Or go golfing while the country is in the middle of pandemic. Pandemic he is done nothing to remove or it least lower the cases ? But no when Stephen Curry says something like this you can’t support him and call him a baby ?  I’m not American but I never been disappointed in country I used to want to visit
Stephen Curry plays for the golden state warriors
"Out of the young guys, Luka, Tatum, and Herro probably have the best chances.  Giannis and AD are both great candidates for guys in the middle of their career. They’re both entering the age where the all time greats started winning their championships.  Out of older guys, it could be the decade of Stephen Curry or James Harden. Their games will age well, and if Curry especially manages stay healthy, he could dominate a lot of the next decade, although I’d be worried about the decline of Klay and Draymond bringing him down in the second half of the decade.  I’d also say, we can’t count on Lebron having the best decade. Tom Brady wasn’t supposed to have as good of a 2010s as he ended up having, and could see the same with Lebron this decade."

"Agreed. But reaching finals means nothing on it's own, as the 73-9 team found out.  I agree that LeBron has reached the finals consistently. But reaching the finals isn't enough. During your peak, another player has had as many rings as you(Stephen Curry). That's not good for the Goat.   Anyways, I agree people who say reaching the finals and not winning is worse than not even reaching the finals. But simply reaching the finals is not enough. You have to win it all. The 73-9 team isn't considered the greatest team of all time for one simple reason. LeBron was the one who knocked them off their perch. Reaching the finals and losing shouldn't be floated about, imo."
"Bazemore got Steph to sign with Under Armour so he's already a legend for that, plus he has gotten paid so much as a bench guy in a career where he's usually the 9th man.

Here were his top 10:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Reggie Miller 3. Larry Bird (solid offensive rebounder, best in terms of touch passes off screens and other off ball passes, also good off ball scorer) 4. Ray Allen 5. Klay Thompson 6. RIP Hamilton 7. Peja Stojakovic 8. JJ Redick 9. Anthony Davis (primarily due to lob threat) 10. Dirk Nowitzki (especially younger Dirk)"

Not really a fun of RW and Harden."
"Wouldn't say horrible but I'm sort of leaning towards the idea that he's a bust. People try to change the definition of a bust too much, especially if said bust is a solid player. But to me, a bust is someone who had extremely high expectations and didn't live up to those expectations.   And given that Lonzo was getting Stephen Curry and Jason Kidd comparisons while being touted as the Lakers' future, he is a bust. He averaged 12-6-7 on 52 TS% this season for God's sake."

"you can say all this shit about range but Damian Lillard shoots 37% from 3 and Stephen Curry shoots 44% from 3. Do you realize how big of a difference that is? Curry is also a better playmaker. When he was playing on-ball as often as Lillard he averaged 8-8.5 assists per game. He also moves without the ball constantly putting so much pressure on the defense, which Damian Lillard does not do. Curry is also a better finisher at the rim (64% vs. 57%) despite not being as athletic. He's also a better ball handler and rebounder.   But The main difference was never the range it was the offball movement. You double lillard get the ball out of his hands. You double curry and the shit still never ends. Then they gotta chase him around all these ball screens and all of a sudden there's a wide open dude at the basket."
"All it took was Kevin Durant rupturing his achilles, Klay Thompson tearing his ACL, and Stephen Curry breaking his hand."
"Since 1991, only 20 players have made an All NBA team in the same season they won a championship. Jimmy would join that group if he did so. A championship would immortalize him as one of the all time greats to ever play the game. So many players can't win a championship as a prime guy, and doing so would be huge for Jimmy's legacy.   * Kawhi Leonard * Kevin Durant * Stephen Curry * Draymond Green * Lebron James * Klay Thompson * Tony Parker * Dwyane Wade * Dirk Nowitzki * Kobe Bryant * Pau Gasol * Kevin Garnett * Paul Pierce * Tim Duncan * Shaquille O'neal * Ben Wallace * Michael Jordan * Scottie Pippen * Hakeem Olujawon * Clyde Drexler"

"Jamal is playing god like right now, of course he’s not better than Stephen Curry, but that doesn’t mean he can’t win against us, from a more neutral analytical point I find unlike that the Lakers lose 3 straight, just too much star power to handle 3 straight games, but the Nuggets showed their strength, unlikely? Yes! Impossible? Hell no."
"If Stephen Curry can get 12 points in 19 secs ^^^in ^^^2k , yall can do it as well Heat!"
If that's the case then they win IMO:   PG: Steve Nash  SG: Steph Curry  SF: Steve Francis  PF: Stephon Marbury  C: Stephen Jackson  6: Stephon Marbury  7: Steven Adams  &amp;#x200B;  This team scores like 200 PPG ^(and gives up 199 ppg.)
"Absolutely nailed it. IMO this is why Lebron’s 2016 ring is sooooo overrated. Beating Stephen “playoff brick layer” Curry who turns into Danny fucking Phantom choking on a god damn golf cart every time he’s in the finals proves absolutely nothing lol. I mean should we really expect this “goat” (in reality he’s top five at best and he’s more a sheep than anything hehe) to lose to the first verse in Eminem’s “lose yourself”? (Arms a sweaty, knees weak, palms are heavy, there vomit on his sweater already=Curry’s finals resumé)"
"The last time they won? Stephen Curry, Dame Lillard, John Wall, Goran Dragic, Kyrie Irving, Isaiah Thomas, Chris Paul, Brandon Knight, Kemba Walker, Ty Lawson, Kyle Lowry all scored more than him. For passing, he was 21st in the league. The reason they won in the playoffs was because of Kawhi coming out, and a solid effort from the rest of the team, and extraordinary support off the bench."
Stephen St. Curry
Stephen St. Curry sounds fire
Stephen St (Saint) Curry actually rolls off the tongue very smoothly.
&gt; StEphan StCurry  I like the way this becomes Stephen Saint Curry.   Which is pretty much how we GS fans think about him anyway.
"Weak take.  They faced each other a total of 35 times in NBA games. Stephen Curry has a 21-14 winning record over LeBron James, including a 15-7 record in Playoffs."
You count on what's worked for you for half a decade now which is Draymond in the playoffs when in shape being a generational defensive player who can also protect the rim at a high level despite being 6'5 which is what other teams like Houston dont have.   Kevon Looney/Draymond Green/Klay Thompson/Jrue Holiday/Stephen Curry vs Markieff Morris/Anthony Davis/LeBron James/KCP/Danny Green or whomever. Is it a guarantee itll work no of course not nothing is in life. But you take your chances and more importantly you dont build an entire team around trying to matchup with one team in particular that's how you end up with the shit show Philly did.
"Okay but was Trae Young shooting anywhere close to Stephen Curry’s percentages when he was in college? Hell no. Still, the Trae Young is a less accurate Stephen Curry was a widely accepted comparison in basketball circles. Ball may not be as accurate as Trae Young but the way in which they shoot 3’s is similar, thus making the comparison valid."
"Steph Curry is the best shooter in the history of basketball. He's able to shoot from half court in game at an efficient level.  WNBA players can't even shoot with an NBA 3 point line.  And Steph Curry did not make the league a global product. Players like Dr J, KAJ, Clyde the Glide and Michael Jordan made the league exciting and incredibly popular because of their insane athleticism.   Kyrie Irving is an incredible athlete and acrobat. He has a 32 inch vertical. The average vertical for female college players in 2004 was 19. A WNBA player will never be able to finish at the rim like Kyrie because they are too short and don't have a high enough vertical. You will never see a player like Kyrie in the WNBA because his ability to finish at the rim requires his above average vertical and the strength and conditioning do this all game long.   Stephen Curry's popularity is a testament to his insane skill, he is a generational talent.   It also worth nothing that Curry is not popular just because of shooting, he has some of the best handles in the NBA. WNBA players will never be able to dribble as well as Curry because women, on average, have much smaller hands and have less stamina, which is very important for doing flashy dribble moves across a 38+ minute game.  There has not been a WNBA player as skilled as Stephen Curry, and there probably never will be.  The WNBA can't rely on a magical shooting and dribbling phenom to make the league popular.   The fact is, that there are more dunks in a single NBA game than in the history of the WNBA.   “I think it would bring a whole different aspect to the game and  bring viewership as well and show the athleticism of our women,” she  told *For The Win* at Nike’s Innovation Summit on Wednesday. “We  do every single thing on that court that the men do, other than the  dunking. And, obviously, there is a handful of athletes who can dunk.”  “But when look at other sports like volleyball, their net’s lower,”  she continued. “Golf, their tees are closer. It goes on and on. Tennis,  they play \[fewer\] sets. Why not lower our rim and let every single  player player in the league play above the rim like the NBA can?”  \- Elena Delle Donne, 5x WNBA All Star, 1x WNBA MVP"
"Yup. Like change of pace has always been looked at as a skill. But the simple fact of the matter is, no repetition can make your body move like a James Harden.   Even shooting. I’m sure there is a human/NBA player/former NBA player on Earth who has taken more shots than Stephen Curry, yet can’t shoot like him. I remember Iguodola said something about how Curry’s hand eye coordination is other worldly, and how he’s watched Curry literally sit down and just hit bullseyes on a dart board over and over again."
"Playing it with friends, nba live on xbox, Stephen Curry highlight machine, it escalates like that.  Really enjoy the shift towards three points and seeing chuck look like a fool making fun of jumpshooting teams."
"I think a good indicator for casual fans is jersey sales. This was the list for top jersey sales in 2020:   LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers   Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks   Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers   Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks   Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors   Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets   Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers   Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers   Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat   Kemba Walker, Boston Celtics   Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets   Russell Westbrook, Houston Rockets   Nikola Jokić, Denver Nuggets   Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies   Literally none of these are inefficient scorers that don’t do much else."
"Stephen Curry is going to go down as the greatest shooter of all time, even if someone breaks his records.   Klay Thompson is the most underrated player of all time."
"Michael Jordan was the ultimate example of the two motion shot.  His ""air time"" was a combination of his jumping ability, his coordination, and his two motion shot, which gave the illusion that he jumped, waited for his defender to fall, then shot an uncontested shot.  He had to be very strong to pull this off efficiently, since he wasn't using his legs at all for the shot.  Any momentum created by his legs had gone by the time he let off his shot.  He could also shoot in one motion and would from the three point line, but that wasn't his specialty.  At the other end of the spectrum, Stephen Curry is the ultimate example of the one motion shot.  He gets so much power from his legs that he can shoot efficiently from thirty feet, thirty-five feet, forty feet, or just over the half court line.  He's usually not going to out jump his defender but his quick release and the fact that he can shoot from anywhere makes up for that.  Also the strict no-touching rules that apply to perimeter defense in this era means the defenders can't guard him too closely at that distance from the basket."
"What? You didn't mention playing style at all.  But totally, skinny SMALL two-guards [*never*](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/stephen-curry/) make it. [Nope, never.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/iversal01.html) [ Not even once.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01.html)"
Some of the greatest shooters of all time:  Steve Kerr  Steve Nash  Steve Novak  Stephen Curry
"If Kevin Durant never joined the Warriors, Stephen Curry would've been known as the greatest scorer of all time.  Steph would've had at least 5 more seasons where he performed like his unanimous MVP season and the seasons after that, he'd still be amazing."
are you saying you think that Ben simmons has the same value as Stephen Curry?  As you in actually believe that the Golden State Warriors would trade Curry for Simmons and think it's a good deal?

Stephen Curry &gt; Magic Johnson
And rookie Stephen Curry
Here's my team: Stephen Curry (ai)  Kevin Durant (lbj)  Scottie Pippen (mj)  Kareem Abdul Jabbar (Shaq)  Kawhi Leonard (Kobe Bryant)

"Im assuming hes talkin primes? Top 3 best primes ever is MJ, lebron, Shaq. Kobe and jordan both attacking w/Shaq in the paint and Lebron passing to them is unbeatable.  I would trade out Iverson for Stephen Curry though."

"Yeah, and Loyola lost by 30. Now imagine it's LeBron James and not an 18-year-old Stephen Curry."
Stephen Curry and Trae Young
Stephen Curry wishes.
"It won’t be easy, but think Stephen curry witj Davidson. Not a special team or literally would not be in the tournament. A skinny shooter changed that bc he was just elite level. Now you take lebron athleticism, you take his skills, his iq, you take his willingness to read the defense hit the open man fast. They will get wide open shots, the defense would be challenging but that’s what ya zone is for to make them shoot further out and close the middle thus somewhat at least cutting into any athletic 1-1 match ups. Anything can happen but hard to bet against lebron James in this case, were not talking about replacing him with Isiah Thomas or Avery Bradley or something. Someone really elite"
I think stephen curry is up there with some of the best passers in the league.
Klay Thompson  Stephen Curry  Luka Doncic  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis  Tyler Herro  Damian Lillard
Luka Doncic  Tracy McGrady  Kobe Bryant  Stephen Curry  Allen Iverson
"The media overhyped Lavar Ball saying Lonzo was better than Stephen Curry. I mean, it was just a proud Dad overblowing his sons ability. Nothing weird about that to be honest. But the media made a huge story about it for some reason."
"This one reporter harmed Cleveland more than Steve Kerr, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant *combined*"
"You're arguing with yourself about semantics. This is so painful and not even a basketball conversation. It's evident that you're a Steph Curry stan but I'm wondering to myself if you have legitimate cognitive development issues at this point.  **Here's what I said:**  &gt;Athleticism can be the difference-maker in youth ball or the average run, but in the NBA, it doesn't compensate for lack of BBIQ or a well-rounded skill-set....What does it matter if you have a 40+ inch vertical if you can't get a clear lane to the hoop? Of course, it helps to be elite athletically, but athleticism can only get you so far in the NBA.  I then went on to suggest that Steph Curry could have the best endurance in the league but contended that he wasn't the fastest player in the league.  **At what point did I say:**  1. That Stephen Curry wasn't athletic: *""people are not less athletic for having a different skillset.""* 2. That Stephen Curry was slow: *""People run the finals of the 100m dash at the Olympics more than a tenth of a second behind the leader, it doesn't make them slow.""* 3. That combine stats were a better indicator of basketball talent? As you can see, my original point was that it actually **wasn't**, and yet here you go: *""How people actually perform in the games is the better metric, not the 0.1 second 30m speed difference at a track meet ten years ago.""* 4. That Stephen Curry was a ""scrub?"" I went as far to single Steph Curry out for his elite BBIQ, incredibly well-rounded skill set, and having some of the best endurance in the NBA, and yet, here you go with your weird insecure projections and conjecture: ""*Acting like he's a scrub or something, those numbers are still really impressive. The guy's an athlete.""*  You provided one poorly designed Twitter stat as a metric of Steph Curry being ""the fastest player in the NBA"" and I objected. If you want to look at the average speed in the NBA, of players who have played more than 40 games, he's not even in the Top-80. Like what are you even on here?  My point was that elite athleticism is not a bottleneck for elite basketball players. At no point did I suggest Stephen Curry wasn't athletic.  As you continue to post on this sub, and presumably continue to create arguments about Steph Curry (??) and get yourself all worked up with yourself (???)  here's an analysis that looks at speed over the past five years: [https://www.thespax.com/nba/speed-and-distance-traveled-in-the-nba/](https://www.thespax.com/nba/speed-and-distance-traveled-in-the-nba/)"
"Now it really depends what you mean here. Because that ""No way most superstars miss that shot. "" seems to suggest 100%, which is.. well quite demonstrably wrong.  But assuming you phrased it weirdly but were referring to person who you replied and meant that no way most superstars are more likely to miss that shot than make it.. then you might be just about correct if most superstars include basically following: Curry (52.5% 1 year ago) [https://goldengatesports.com/2019/09/02/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-open/#:\~:text=Nobody%20could%20consider%20even%20helping,shots%2C%20which%20is%20just%20astronomical](https://goldengatesports.com/2019/09/02/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-open/#:~:text=Nobody%20could%20consider%20even%20helping,shots%2C%20which%20is%20just%20astronomical)  or from past season's stats JJ Redick (57.7%), Joe Harris (53.9%) and Bojan Bogdanovic (50.5%).  However most superstars in this case shouldn't include names like Paul George (48.5%), KAT (46.8%), Lillard (42.6%), Booker (39.8%) or even Mr Lebron James (38.5%).  In fact I couldn't find single superstar that could reliably do it over 50% and even many sharpshooters did not quite make it (Robinson and Herro both around 45%)"
"Cousy and Havlicek would defs have made the HoF regardless, agreed  &gt;Heinsohn  is a nice player but was only a 6 time all star, so he likely isn't making the HOF without rings (e.g. LMA is a 7-time All-Star but only has [51% chance of making the HOF](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html))  &gt;Sanders  is a 0 time all star, most certainly not making the HoF without his 8 rings  &gt;Clyde  is a 4-time All-star, again not enough to make HoF without being on Russell's team  ---  EDIT: Here are some other stats regarding Russell's impact on the team:  - **At the height of their dynasty, the Celtics were comically dominant. From 1962-65, their average margin-of-victory (MOV) was over 8 points per game. During the same time span, only two other teams even eclipsed 4 points per game – the ’64 Royals and the ’64 Warriors. And all of Boston’s separation was created by its historic defense, anchored by Russell: https://backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Russell-era-rDRtg-for-Bos.png**  - *""Russell didn’t join the team until partway through his rookie season, and before hopping aboard, Boston looked like an improved club (playing at a 58-win pace for 19 full-strength games). Still, what transpired in the ensuing years cannot be attributed to teammates or a defense-first strategy. Boston platooned different players around Russell while he anchored the greatest defensive dynasty in NBA history. At its height (1960-1966), Russell played 43 to 45 minutes per game while only Sam Jones topped 35 per game (once, in 1965). During the 1963 season, no other Celtic played over 31 minutes per contest. To put Boston’s defensive dominance into perspective, let’s zoom out and revisit the above graph, but this time using all defensive seasons since 1955:* ***https://backpicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bos-Russell-D-vs-all-teams.png""***  - *Despite a smattering of famous names, the offenses were never anything to write home about. In ’55 and ’56, Cousy, the sharp-shooting Sharman and the hyper-efficient Easy Ed Macauley powered attacks that were 2 to 3 points ahead of the league. With Russell in for Macauley in ’57, Boston’s offense dipped to around average, where it would hover until 1960.8 In ’61, Sharman trailed off in his final season, Cousy slowed further and defensive notables like KC Jones and Tom Sanders saw more time. During the heart of the ’60s, the Celtics finished about 3 points worse than the league in offensive efficiency based on our best estimations.*  - Russell didn’t miss much time in his career, so WOWY numbers are hard to come by. Journalists and teammates always claimed that the Celtics fell apart without him; **Boston was a 35-win team (-1.9 SRS) in 28 games he missed from 1958-69, and for the other 915 games of his career they played at a 59-win pace (6.4 SRS)**. This is a tiny piece of evidence – the years are spread out, teams change, and so on — but it echoes the same story as Russell’s other value signals. **For instance, when his teammates missed time, Boston rarely missed a beat. In 1958, Bob Cousy sat for seven games and the Celtics played far better without him. In ’59 and ’60, Sharman, Cousy and Tom Heinsohn missed a few games each, and the machine kept on ticking. In ’61, Sharman missed 18 games and the Celtics were (again) better without him. In ’62, Cousy missed five and, yes, the Celtics were better without him (portending his retirement years).** But Russell missed four games in 1962 and Boston’s differential fell by 22 points. Four games is infinitesimally small, but all of these stories point in the same direction. It was only when Russell was hampered by injury (in the 1958 Finals) that the Celtics fell short of a title — the single time a Russell team failed to win in a 12-year span dating back to college. **This trend would hold throughout most of Russell’s career. In ’66, Sam Jones missed eight games and Boston’s performance didn’t budge. Jones missed 11 more contests in ’69 and the team was about 2 points worse without him. All told, as the roster cycled around Russell, his impact seemed to remain.** A more detailed calculation of his game-level value has Russell at the top of the impact-heap in his era, while similar studies have him behind only Jerry West and Oscar Robertson (who both had the fortune of playing on dominant teams during the most watered-down years in NBA history).    #[source](https://backpicks.com/2018/04/02/backpicks-goat-3-bill-russell/)   Just name-dropping HoFers isn't quite enough; Russell's impact-metrics all paint the same picture: Those dynastic Celtics teams' success were largely due to his presence, much like [how the Warriors' success runs through Steph](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/) (though on the opposite side of the ball)"
"Ok your site link was actually very helpful thank you, I will definitely be using this in the future. I used it to find some stats of my own to prove some of the points I made. You say Philly's offence with Embiid and Simmons on the court was best in the league, but in 17/18 Harden and CP3's same on/off ORTG was 122.2 in 907 minutes and Stephen Curry and Klay's ORTG was 123.35 so they still weren't the best offence of the season if you want to use duo on/off stats to do that.  My point is that you could put basically any point guard onto that team and they would succeed, they succeeded despite Simmons and Embiid not fitting together. You would have done better with any point guard who can shoot, it would only serve to open up the offence more for Embiid and it would space the floor for Redick to get more open shots.   You say playtype data is ""cherrypicked"" yet use on/off TS% without recognising the flaws in that stat. If you compare the TS% of Simmons and CP3 you would think they are both just as good shooters and equally efficient and valuable which is clearly not true. You also use the TS% for Embiid with Simmons on/off the floor (which is giving me slightly different numbers to you but does show a 1/2% increase with Simmons on the floor) but neglect to mention that he scores -4.3 pts per 100 possessions less with Simmons on the floor over the last 3 seasons. So of course his TS% will increase because he is taking less shots overall with Simmons in the game, which is a bad thing because it means shots are being taken away from Embiid.  Yes that is how you should build an NBA offence, shot creation and 3pt shooting are incredibly valuable and no team has won a ring in the last 10 years without having their main ball handler be able shoot from outside of 8ft. You had the absolute best possible pieces to make up for Simmon's inability to shoot outside of the paint and it still wasn't enough. If you want to win a ring you need your primary ball handler to be a threat from at least the midrange let alone the 3pt line. Giannis and Westbrook have faced the same issues in the playoffs where they cannot just bulldoze their way to the rim every time in the half court.    Embiid is supposed to be the focal point of your offence of course the +/- favours him, but Butler is your best playoff performer in that series. His per game stats all improved from the regular season whilst Embiid's and Simmon's both dropped. Embiid averaged 17.6/8.7/3.3 on 37/34/83 splits an absolutely awful series compared to his regular season averages of 27.5/13.6/3.7 on 48/30/80 splits. Butler averaged 22/7/5.6 on 44/28/88 splits which is an improvement from his regular season 18.2/5.3/4 on 46/34/87 splits. How on earth you could think Embiid was better in that series is beyond me no matter what the +/- data is."
"Yes actually. They already admitted they didn't want to give it to Stephen Curry. ""We were split with 3 votes to Curry, 4 to Iguodala, and 4 to Lebron. We didn't want to give it to a player on the losing team, so we combined and decided to give it to Iguodala since it fit the small ball narrative.""  Say what you want - whether it was conspiring against Steph or Lebron, it was still conspiring. The clear best player on the winning team - who went off when the series was tied - didn't get a single vote. I was surprised yo say the least. But remember - they have media analysts and journalists making the votes. All up to their narrative"
"Look I know bob knight is a very good coach but I just plain don't agree with that last statement. Curry in college made good nba point guard passes. But as good a passer as ever played in college? Nope. Dude isn't Magic or Nash. If you even bother to look at the draft profile you immediately see the difference in how they talk about passing between curry and nash or magic. As evidence. https://www.nbadraft.net/players/stephen-curry/ http://www.ibiblio.org/craig/draft/1996_draft/scout/pg.html#Nash  You're not going to convince me that curry's passing is great. Especially for a starting point guard in the NBA. He isn't top 10 in the NBA currently as far as passing goes. Much less an all time passer. You don't ever say his passing is his greatest strength. It's a positive asset, not a negative at all. Just not ""great"". It feels like people are doing the old UFC ""underrated ground game"" lately with popular players abilities in the nba. Kyle lowry is a better passer of the basketball than Curry as it comes to current NBA point guards."

"I agree 100%. SB Nation put out an article before game 6 of that series where they went through games 1-5 and tried to see if anything malicious was going on. They made some great points   “These series of plays are the logical extension of that. Were they dirty? I'd say the ankle trip that Jackson referred to probably is, while the rest are somewhere between coincidental and on purpose”  “I don't think it's fair to say that they had this gameplan because they are bad people that want Curry to suffer. They had this gameplan because they were facing elimination, had been torched for three games straight by Curry and were willing to pull out all the stops to make sure that didn't happen again”  “We must also consider that it's in Jackson's best long-term interest for the Nuggets' actions to be seen as dirty. His comments come from a reasonable place, but they were also calculated as heck. It is wrong for us to accept them at face value without considering the obvious benefit they have for his team”  https://www.sbnation.com/2013/5/1/4288556/denver-nuggets-dirty-stephen-curry-mark-jackson"
"“It seems likely this ""mole"" accusation originates from Mark Jackson accusing Karl of sending ""hit men"" to play Stephen Curry physical during the series. Iguodala didn't agree with the tactics and it's likely he expressed this to Jarrett Jack during Game 5, according to Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News“"
"Honestly, his game is more than statistics. Look at the team he was on. He was not asked to score. He had Stephen Fucking Curry and Klay lighting it up. He was asked to defend. He still was a key player on an all-time great team and played his role to perfection. Trying to look through the lense of stats just smacks of blog boi ism."
"So if I am making a list, it would basically be:  Giannis Antetokounmpo (depending on how you feel about re-signing him, given his contract)  Luka Doncic (possibly the best 20y ever to play, still a rookie, and you get his RFA rights after that, so I think you have to take 7-ish years of him over LeBron at his current age)  Anthony Davis (they are both on the Lakers so not possible, but if another team had him, maybe given his youth vs. LeBron)  Stephen Curry (when healthy, maybe the best offensive player in the league and best shooter of all time)  Kawhi Leonard (has beaten LeBron in the finals before, is younger, better defender, better iso game)  That would be my entire list and the key issue here is LeBron's age, otherwise even most of those I would trade for LeBron. I think the worst one to trade for LeBron would be Luka, purely because of his already being an MVP-caliber player at age 20.  Edit: if my goal is to win the finals this year only, the only player I might rank above LeBron is Kawhi. My list is based on long-term value."

"Sure. So, let's clear things up first. Nuggets fans have taken Karl's comments as Iggy giving plays and other important information to the Warriors to help tip the series. This, simply isn't true.  The information being given is that the George Karl and the Nuggets were making an attempt to target Curry's ankles and potentailly injury him. Something the Saints got bans and suspensions for in the NFL.  Furthermore, George Karl never actually called Iguadola a mole. That's the Denver reporter setting up the question that way. And people think it's something far worse than what happened. The comments were about the ankle targeting specifically. He did not deny the ankle targeting, but instead he said Iguadola is the one who gave the information, and that Mark Jackson is bush league:  &gt;Krieger: Do you think Andre Iguodala was Mark Jackson’s “mole”? &gt;Karl: No question.  &gt;Krieger: Does that bug you?  &gt;Karl: I just think that’s media hype. I mean, that series was not a physical series. Everybody wants to be more aggressive with the guy kicking your ass, so . . . .  &gt;Krieger: The media didn’t say it. Jackson said it.  &gt;Karl: I thought Mark had a lot of tricks in that series that were bush- . . . I don’t know. I don’t know what they were. Almost high-schoolish. They were beneath the NBA level. And they might have worked. They might have motivated his young team in a good way. You know, he’d announce a starting lineup and start another guy. C’mon, man. You think we’re not ready for that?  &gt;[Source](https://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/11/29/george-karl-rips-mark-jackson-andre-iguodala-mole)  Tim Kawakami, of the Mercury News, at the time explained what happened:  &gt;Iguodala had told Warriors guard Jarrett Jack he was opposed to being extra tough on injured Golden State guard Stephen Curry &gt;[Source](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/12/23/5239064/andre-iguodala-mole-george-karl-mark-jackson)  Iguadola also talked about that interaction with Jarrett Jack himself, his comments:  Mark Jackson said that someone from the Nuggets told him he wasn’t on board with this. Was that you?  -IGUODALA: No, I don’t think that was the case. We’re on the court and maybe Jarrett Jack said, ‘y’all are playing dirty.’ I responded, saying, “I don’t play dirty.’ But I don’t think anybody on our team was playing dirty. We were just playing a little more physical.  &gt;[Source](http://blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/2013/11/30/warriors-update-the-iguodalageorge-karlmark-jackson-triangle-the-gsws-strong-early-season-schedule/)  Another quote by SB writer Drew Garrison:  &gt;This all traces back to Karl telling his team he wants them to play Curry physical, Iguodala not agreeing with the tactic and passing it along to Jack, who then let Jackson know what was said to him. This is a little dicey and teeters on the ""he said, she said"" fence, but it's interesting nonetheless.  &gt;[Source](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/12/1/5162790/andre-iguodala-mole-nuggets-warriors-george-karl-playoffs)  Also, an important fact Nuggets fans ignore from that series:  &gt;Whatever the case may be, this didn't affect Iguodala's on-court performance in the series. He averaged 18 points (50 percent from the field, 48 percent from beyond the arc), eight rebounds, 5.3 assists and two steals in Denver's six games against the Warriors. All of his playoff statistics were better than his regular season aside from averaging .1 assists fewer in the six-game series.  &gt;(Same source prior.)  Throughout those sources, you will seem theories that fall along the lies of Jackson was probably being hyperbolic or lying about his claims (falls in line with his track record), and George Karl was being butt-hurt (falls in line with his track record).  Of course, that's speculation, but that scenario is not only the same speculation that Iggy threw the series and gave up plays like talked about in r/nuggets, but Occam's razor would preference the former speculation.   I can also get more sources if you like, because I know NBC Sports had a few articles themselves related to this from previous conversations with Nuggets fans about this."

Stephen Curry at 45.3% on 7.5+ 3PA in fucking 12/13. Truly a pioneer.
These are the best completed seasons in NBA history by 3P% of players who attempted at least 7.5 threes per game.      - Stephen Curry at 45.4% in 2015/16   - Stephen Curry at 45.3% in 12/13   - Stephen Curry at 44.3% in 14/15   - Stephen Curry at 43.7% in 18/19      Duncan Robinson is at 43.8% this year
Tell a opposition I ain’t never worried keep the 30 on me like I’m Stephen Curry
rockets more warriors less because stephen curry is better than james harden.

"Wilt's peak volume scoring regular season was 1961-62 (I'm not going to mention the flaws in his offensive game that season, why it wasn't even his best season, et cetera). During that season, he scored 28.7 PTS/75 on +5.7 rTS. Here are regular seasons where people scored more PTS/75 on better rTS (with Wilt's 1961-62 season for listed for reference):  |Player|Season|PTS/75|rTS| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Wilt Chamberlain|1961-62|28.7 PTS/75|\+5.7 rTS| |Stephen Curry|2018-19|28.8 PTS/75 |\+8.4 rTS  | |James Harden|2016-17|28.8 PTS/75 |\+6.0 rTS  | |Adrian Dantley|1985-86|28.8 PTS/75 |\+8.8 rTS  | |Kawhi Leonard|2016-17|29.2 PTS/75 |\+5.7 rTS  | |Karl Malone|1997-98|29.2 PTS/75 |\+7.3 rTS  | |Ricky Pierce|1990-91|29.3 PTS/75 |\+7.1 rTS  | |Kevin Durant|2015-16|29.3 PTS/75 |\+9.3 rTS  | |Yao Ming|2006-07|29.4 PTS/75 |\+6.0 rTS| |Shaquille O'Neal|2001-02|29.4 PTS/75 |\+7.0 rTS| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|2018-89|29.5 PTS/75 |\+8.7 rTS| |Kevin Durant|2009-10|29.6 PTS/75 |\+6.4 rTS  | |Shaquille O'Neal|1998-99|29.7 PTS/75 |\+7.3 rTS  | |Stephen Curry|2017-18|29.9 PTS/75 |\+11.9 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1988-89|30.0 PTS/75 |\+7.7 rTS  | |LeBron James|2009-10|30.0 PTS/75 |\+6.1 rTS  | |Karl Malone|1996-97|30.0 PTS/75|\+6.4 rTS  | |Shaquille O'Neal|1997-98|30.1 PTS/75 |\+6.3 rTS  | |Karl Malone|1989-90|30.5 PTS/75 |\+8.9 rTS  | |Kevin Durant|2013-14|31.4 PTS/75 |\+9.4 rTS  | |James Harden|2017-18|31.7 PTS/75 |\+6.3 rTS  | |Isaiah Thomas|2016-17|31.8 PTS/75 |\+7.2 rTS  | |Stephen Curry|2015-16|31.9 PTS/75 |\+12.8 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1990-91|32.0 PTS/75 |\+7.1 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1989-90|32.0 PTS/75 |\+6.9 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1987-88|32.7 PTS/75 |\+6.5 rTS  | |James Harden |2018-19|36.2 PTS/75|\+5.9 rTS  |  This is purely judging them based on scoring. People will bring up the argument that Wilt played 48.5 MPG, but I think that speaks more to his endurance and physical shape than his scoring ability.  If you want to discuss post-season scoring, where most players tend to have a more difficult time, Wilt still wouldn't be the best (Jordan for one is definitely better, and there's quite a few more you could add to the list)."

"“Their offense was much better with Kerr running through Curry”  Again, Out of the three years, The warriors had the best offensive rating in the regular season in guess which year? 2019. The year that they played through KD on offense https://imgur.com/a/hX5QDjt.   The KD-centric warriors last regular season ran the best offense in league history (Prior to Dallas this year).......So no, The warriors running through Curry wasn’t better at all. Don’t lie.  “It doesn’t seem like Draymond and KD played more minutes together”   Expect they did.......KD and Draymond played their highest % of minutes together of the 3 years when you allocate for % of minutes played.  “From what I saw it’s clear Cavs prioritized Curry”  Again....Based on what? Stephen curry attempted 18 more shots than Kevin Durant in the 2018 finals. Why did the Cavs defense let Curry shoot 18 more times (many of them open) if they prioritized him over KD.....A lot of those shots were open for curry too.....  Again, Teams guarding curry more is just a myth, All the data and the film just doesn’t support it. KD was actually guarded more in the most of their series in the half court.  “There’s more to offense than Scoring”  Yes, And KD leveled up as a passer and Is not behind Curry in that aspect. I’d actually argue he’s a better passer. KD has a massive scoring edge as well making him the bette offensive player. Defensively it’s not close. All offensive metrics point to KD in the playoffs."
"He’s better 5v5 because he opens up more opportunities for his teammates and creates easy baskets. He also controls the flow of a game better. There is a reason his plus minus and ORTG are absurdly high. KD will score at will but him shooting fadeaway midrange jumpers isn’t getting Looney an easy layup.  This is most obvious in the TS% chart:  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-stephen-curry-mvp/   When Steph’s off the floor, everyone’s TS drastically dips, vs a much smaller decrease for KD."
1. Luka Doncic  2. Stephen Curry  3. Zion Williamson
"Stephen Curry did NOT revolutionize the NBA  Not trying to hate here, but what exactly did Steph Curry do to ""revolutionize"" the NBA?  You can say he inspired teams to take more 3's....i guess, but the analytics movement (a la Rockets) played a big part in that as well.  It's not like the NBA changed any rules because of him. If anything I think teams try to copy the Warriors style of play as a team, they just don't have a trio of shooters like Steph, Klay &amp; KD.  It's not like Steph invented the 3 point shot or forced the NBA to move the 3 point line back. You can say he's by far the best shooter ever, and he is, but that's not the same as changing how the sport is played.."

"&gt; Thanks for showing everyone you know nothing about basketball.  lol  &gt; Have you seen the lakers roster? What amazing role players do they have? Lol. Lakers are playing well because of lebron. He makes them look good.  Thank you for showing everyone your blatant lack of reading comprehension.   Where did I say they have amazing role players right now? Regardless of the fact that I consider Dwight Howard and Danny Green good players.   Remember on the Heat and Cavs, where role players/vets would take discounts to play with him because of the chance at a title and the fact that he would buff their stats?  &gt; Warriors have the best shooter in history coming back. They have an excellent 3&amp;D player in Klay coming back. Draymond is draymond and can do lots of different things. They have assets to bring in another star player.  Like I said, Stephen Curry is equal to LeBron in terms of impact IMO; which is a huge fucking compliment.   AD is better on both sides of the ball than Klay, who is going to take time to get into his groove off of the injury.   Draymond Green is a phenomenal defender and a good playmaker, but he's not what's going to put the Warriors over the Lakers.   The assets they have are not going to net them a star player in my opinion, but like I said; let's see it play out before we make any definitive statements."
We're going to see Stephen Curry levels of value contracts over the next 2-3 years. The players that got those huge contracts in 15-16 that sucked are laughing all the way to the bank.
"I hate to say it but this is a bad idea. It could go south VERY quickly. For every Lebron and Giannis and Steph Curry, there are also Dwight Howards and Stephen Jacksons in the NBA. It only takes one guy saying something crazy to derail the whole thing, and all of a sudden we’re talking about how some role player believes cops are covid zionists or some crazy shit."
Because  Stephen curry and all the other warriors are doing that without being confined in the bubble
YouTube Stephen curry deep 3s and you'll find plenty of videos. You posted a high lights video in a discussion about deep 3s. Unrelated.
Reminds me of Stephen Curry before being drafted. And after being drafted.
"In the last year the answer is Stephen Curry. Overall it’s James Harden. Curry’s disrespect comes from people forgetting what the guy does when he calls his own number, the man changed the league! Harden’s disrespect comes from how he chooses to approach the game just doesn’t endear him to the fans. I didn’t appreciate his greatness until I started betting on the Rockets LOL."

"Having Zion, an all star in BI, Stephen Curry with a 40 inch vertical, and the previous owner of longest playoff run; all that in a conference where 12 teams are competing for 8 spots."

"This is so stupid. I’m getting truly tired of this narrative.   For one, the “MASSIVE TS DIFFERENCE!!” was a whopping 1 total percentage point higher than his last year in OKC.   Kevin Durant in OKC 2016 -  Open shot frequency - 27%  Kevin Durant in GSW 2017 (his highest TS GSW year)   Open shot frequency - 22%  Now, am I saying Curry didn’t help Durant? No, of course he did. And the numbers show in the playoffs. Good players ALWAYS help other good players, especially when it comes to spacing and pressure. Klay included. But to pretend like Curry is the sole reason for Durants jump in TS is almost OBJECTIVELY wrong.   Look at KDs 2017 Finals performance. It’s almost legendary statistically. He was at the same level in terms of TS... when STEPH wasn’t on the court. And his open shot frequency was an abysmal 27%.  And statistically speaking, Curry TS rose in the playoffs as well with Durant. Using on/off, both players were their best when they were together.   One person wrote an article called “Mr. Unreliable” about Durant, and got massive backlash. He was never “known” as that. This is coming from an OKC fan, Durant was never known to be a lesser version of himself in the playoffs just because his TS dropped a couple points. That’s literally not true. It’s hilarious when people bring up the spacing of GSW, but ignore the spacing of OKC. OKC spacing wasn’t normal either, it was on the other side of the spectrum of GSW. It was that bad and he still performed.   Durant in GSW is the best version of Durant. The Finals performances show that.  He got better a player and stats show that. They also show that Curry made him better, and vice versa. Curry IS THE SYSTEM, he impacted that team like no one else could. But please stop diminishing Durants contributions just to give more credit to Stephen Curry.   *And one last thing: Doc Rivers also called KD the most unstoppable player in basketball last year as they threw every sort of double and triple team they could at him. Pat Bev and Lou also said “we tried everything.” It’s not impossible to double Durant when Curry is on the court, that narrative isn’t true either."
Just off of memory I think minesota drafted two pgs and both weren’t Stephen curry. Flynn and rubio
"Plus we had a cleanse of no sports, so not everyone will come back to watch after having the cycle of constant sports watching broken.  Also no Stephen Curry and the NBA putting fat Zion on most national TV games can’t be good for ratings."
The people clearly didnt watch the game Iggy got the fmvp because he tamed the beast that is lebron in critical moments.  This was also before stephen curry turned into what he is today.
"Not a Warriors fan, but i can imagine most are feeling pretty great about Monta Ellis being traded away so that one Stephen Curry could have the keys"
This is why people need to understand what Stephen Curry has been doing the past 5 years is basically unprecedented  What other guys do u know at his size have had the impact and dominance Curry's been able to have?
[Stephen Curry worked him over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzszeBrAj5s).
"I really don't like the inefficiency of James Harden. And it is not like Kobe Bryant's inefficiency but can lead his team to wins and championships. And Kobe plays great defense!!!  Harden lives and dies on his step back three. If he goes off night, they are in trouble.  Stephen Curry is a lot better shooter than Harden. But steph does not take as many attempts as harden is taking."
"How is this a yikes? Curry is the better player and who I’d take in the playoffs. Instead of commenting something without any substance, try proving me wrong. What Stephen Curry playoff game was more impressive than what Luka Doncic just did? Take teams, stats, context, clutch, without his running mate into account."
"Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Luka Doncic."

"Wardell Stephen Curry II. His dad goes by ""Dell"" Curry."
"Of course, but it’s the fact that you’re saying a player that averaged 25/9 on insane shooting splits with a worst team as a rookie (and only did better his second year) can’t be as good. He’s literally following the Stephen Curry mold and has surpassed what even Curry did early on in his career.   Trae is generational as well, he only gets the hate because Luka is absurd too. When Trae gets a better team around him like Luka has, you’ll start noticing how good of a talent he actually is. People treat Trae like he’s some crappy volume shooter that can’t replicate his stats on a good team. The Hawks get the pass imo."
"&gt;He is on the same level of them. The stats say it, the footage says it and he has been the best player in the playoffs so far  Dude you're so fucking full of shit. The stats do not say it, and the footage of 4 playoff games doesn't solidify shit. You should probably go back and look at how dominant Stephen Curry / Kevin Durant were prior to their injury years for FULL playoff runs.  The fact that you are arguing about efficiency / volume is comical. They are all around the same volume actually, but he is **MUCH** worse than two of the players around his volume regarding efficiency. Harden has 6 more shot attempts per game by the way and assumes the same star role."
"Hey you fucking clown, do you not remember your exact words being that he's better than Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden and Steph Curry? There's actually tons of statistical evidence that proves he isn't you fucking autist.  I have a tip for you to actually comprehend how you're wrong but I have a feeling your mental disorder will still lead you to believe you are correct for some reason.  &amp;#x200B;  Step 1) Click on Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden etc's basketball reference for career statistical breakdown  Step 2) Look at stats  Step 3) Compare them with Luka's stats  Step 4) Realize you are wrong  &amp;#x200B;  **Kevin Durant - 49% FG / 38% from 3 / 88% From FT / 54% EFG**  Luka - 44.5% FG / 32% from 3 / 73% from FT / 51% EFG  &amp;#x200B;  **Stephen Curry - 47% FG / 43% from 3 / 90% from FT / 58% EFG**  Luka - 44.5% FG / 32% from 3 / 73% from FT / 51% EFG  &amp;#x200B;  **James Harden -** 44.3% FG **/ 36% from 3 / 85% FT / 52.7% EFG**  Luka - **44.5% FG** / 32% from 3 / 73% from FT / 51% EFG  &amp;#x200B;  Here you go dumbass. Here's statistical evidence which literally proves you wrong. Bold text = stats go to the winner in the category. Luka won in a single Category out of 12 when comparing him to 3 players by a whopping .2 percent. Now shut the fuck up and go take your medication."
"Locks are: Lebron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Pau Gasol, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antekoumpo, Marc Gasol, Carmelo Anthony, and Luka Doncic.  Guys that probably get in are Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Derrick Rose.  Guys that might get in are Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Al Horford, and Andre Iguodala.  Everyone else is too early in their career to get a good idea, or isn’t really on a good path for the hall of fame."

"You are reading that trade backwards via hindsight, that trade was about giving Ellis a way out of a dead team with no talent. Bogut was a washed injury case.

"I feel like you’d be forgetting Luka isn’t American. Steven Adams in 2016 said Stephen Curry and klay Thompson we’re running around like Little monkeys and no one cared because he’s a foreign player and they don’t bring the same baggage as someone whose grown up learning about racial taboos. Now Steven Adams is Australian which in fact actually does have similar slurs, but he was given a pass anyways. Luka is even further removed in that his first language isn’t even English. If he ever did use that word (dude seems smart enough not to), it shouldn’t care the same weight it would if JJ Reddick said it.  Edit: Adams isn’t Australian, he’s from New Zealand.
