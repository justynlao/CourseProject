Russell Westbrook is Eric Bledsoe thinking he’s Steph Curry
Eric Bledsoe is a poor mans Russell Westbrook.
'They're gonna call a technical on Russell Westbrook for delay of game'
"My favorite on/off luck stat.  In the 2017 first round OKC vs HOU series, Russell Westbrook played 39 minutes per game and was +15 overall.  After getting blown out in game 1, he posted a positive plus/minus in each of the next four games and was better than +10 in three of them.  In the 46 minutes he sat, the Thunder went -58.  In the deciding fifth game, Russ was +12 in 42 minutes and they lost by 6.  Poor lil guy"
"I don't think he's carrying a higher load,  I take a look at usage rate and know, you should try it sometimes. Luka is UNDENIABLY carrying a significantly higher offensive load while he's on the floor.   Turnovers aren't purely a passing stat and again it doesn't say anything about passer ability on top of that I said TEND to produce more turnovers. Players like Jason Kidd or Russell Westbrook exist as well my man."
We look to Russell Westbrook...
"Met Russell Westbrook a day after his triple 20 game (at a museum out of all places). I complemented him on the game and said how amazing it was to watch. He thanked me and then I asked him for a pic to which he obliged, and then afterwards he gave me a fist bump and he had to go. Very chill and humble and respectful. Definitely seemed much nicer than the vibe the media gives him. Would love to hangout with him again given the chance."
"Met a ton.  Gary Trent Jr. - Humble, well-spoken, respectable guy.  DeAndre Ayton - told my 5’7 point guard “I’ll eat you, bitch” definitely talented, but didn’t seem very humble and I wasn’t a fan, quite frankly.  Mitch Richmond - Amazing dude. Threw me a lob in a dunk contest and I missed it off the back iron and I’ll never ever forgive myself for that  Russell Westbrook - solid, solid dude. Insanely generous to his inner circle. I have insane respect for him.  Eric Bledsoe - I have the latest W in a game of FIFA 2010 so hey I may not have made it to the league but a win is a win baby. He’s another really solid dude out of Alabama, love his game but as a person he’s funny as hell  Kobe Bryant - completely ignored me when I asked for an autograph, acted like I wasn’t even there. Honestly I don’t blame him whatsoever, I was a 12 year old kid and probably super annoying when he was just trying to enjoy his Pei Wei.  Klay Thompson - My favorite story. Guarded him in a tournament game &amp; he was so fucking good. He almost did the nastiest dunk ever bar none on the kid playing center but the kid took a charge and the ball bounced off of the back iron and soared to the roof of the stadium. He is the most impressive player in the league to me because his jump shooting was NOTHING in high school like it is now, which shows just how hard he worked on improving his craft. Again, the utmost respect to that man.  Thats it. Only person I didn’t really like was Ayton but I get defensive over my players so I’m sure it’s understandable"
Russell “No friends but Spalding” Westbrook
You gonna say Russell Westbrook or Allen Iverson  aren’t decent either despite the fact that they’re two of the most inefficient players ever ???

"This has gone much better than my attempt lol    All-Star Game: Most Unlikable Edition  In light of Russell Westbrook getting mad at the guy in Minnesota I thought I’d list the NBAs most unlikable, but talented players. Condescending, narcissistic maybe, but hey they’re good so figure them out or someone else will.  This is obviously subjective based off their interviews and what I’ve seen. I imagine there will be some better answers don't expect me to defend. I’m also not going into criminal records, just character/how they treat media.   Edit: My b had wolves in east  East:  Kyrie Irving (the guy is just unhappy)  KD (makes fake twitter accounts, ruined nba balance)  Jimmy Butler (if half abusing/yelling gets u pumped then a great teammate)   Kanter is unlikable enough to be less talented  Ben Simmons (bro shoot a 3 u just seem lazy after being #1 pick)  &amp;#x200B;  West:  Westbrook (mad at everyone)  Harden (seriously how are these two on the same team. Other teammates can not enjoy playing there)  Anthony Davis (if I were a NO fan I’d be pissed)  Chris Paul (there’s a reason R.W. and him were traded for one another. More like CP3-6 weeks out)  Draymond Green (not needed but KD anyone?)  Bonus: KAT (not as easy of a choice and could just be me, but immature/spoiled. Wolves should be better)  (I'd say Grayson Allen but not good enough)"
"That’s true. Not to mention the Lakers bench would be DEEP. As for second, I’d say Warriors, Spurs, Bulls, Celtics, 76ers, or Thunder/Sonics or Rockets would all have a good chance at second.   Bulls: DRose/Jordan/Scottie/Rodman/Gilmore  Spurs: Parker/Gervin/Kawhi/Duncan/Robinson  Celtics: Cousy or Kyrie/Pierce/Bird/Garnett or McHale/Russell  76ers: Iverson/Iggy/Erving/Barkley/M Malone  Thunder: Payton/Westbrook or Harden/KD/Kemp/Sikma  Rockets: Westbrook/Harden/TMac/Horry/Olajuwon"
cool. from the absolute bottom of my heart fuck russell westbrook
damian lillard is the player russell westbrook thinks he is
I need a healthy Blazers vs Houston in the playoffs because I so badly need Dame to send Russell Westbrook home
"Russell ""6th man at best"" Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook: *what what you talking about*
Sound like Russell Westbrook
"No, he said “this all goes back to the all star debate” but it doesn’t. The guy I’m responding to is wrong. Talking about whether Russell westbrook has become a top 10 player again and then saying booker is better, which that guy implied, has nothing to do with the all star debate. I didn’t mention anything about the all star debate and you responded to me talking only about the all star thing. It’s like a game of telephone and now I’m stuck in a conversation I don’t give a fuck about. I don’t care about the all star shit you can go cry somewhere else lol. I understand though, booker got snubbed.   And yes, we will have to see if westbrook maintains the streak he’s been on the last 22 games. But if you read a bunch of other comments in this post, you’ll see that in this 22 game streak, he’s putting up better numbers in a lot of ways than his mvp season. He was obviously a top 10 player that season, so if he’s doing better now, then he’s starting to reclaim the title of “top 10 player.” You’re definitely not giving him enough slack for playing poorly at the beginning of the season, he had messed up hands and was thrown in an offense where he had a green light to just shoot 3s all day and he’s never been a great shooter. If he continues to have the success he’s having, he will cement himself as a top 10 player. I see no reason why he couldn’t continue this because it’s not like he hit a shooting streak or something. He just cleaned up his shot selection and is playing to his strengths, namely insane athleticism and playmaking ability."
"Literally irrelevant. This isn’t discussing who should be an all star. The parent comment we’re talking about is “has Russell westbrook cemented himself as a top 10 player again.” And I’m responding to a guy saying if Russ is top 10 then what is booker. In that comparison, I’m not even just taking this season into account, I’m taking everything I know about them, like the fact that Russell westbrook carried a terrible team to a 5 seed in the west 3 years ago. I also take into account that for some reason this year his 3 ball won’t go in, but on the bright side he remembered how to shoot free throws and has developed an insane post game. He’s a brilliant passer and has improved his shot selection drastically while adjusting to a new team. Russ is better than booker, but I agree that booker should be an all star in a perfectly fair world"
"The premise of the question is that Russell westbrook has found out how to play in the rockets offense and has therefore improved in efficiency. So his season long true shooting percentage isn’t really relevant. His terrible 3 shooting kept his ts% down but he’s basically stopped taking them and is doing much better as a result. He’s not the scorer devin booker is, but he’s an elite playmaker and much better passer. But sure, Booker deserves more credit."
Russell “net negative” Westbrook
russell westbrook continues to ball otu i love it
"Russell ""Shouldn't be an All-Star"" Westbrook"
"""Russell Westbrook has taken over the game here in the 3rd.""     How many times have we heard that statement this season? Guy always turns up in the second half."
Russell “not an all-star” Westbrook is pretty good at basketball.
"Suffice it to say, he's right. Russell Westbrook gets bigger ratings for an All Star game than Devin Booker."
Russell Westbrook is ridiculous.
"Russell Westbrook - LA native, always play hard, going for third MVP(would tie him for 2nd, and leave him 1 behind Kobe)"
"To all of the idiots on here saying a few of the following things, in one way or another:     * Start playing better and stop complaining. * CP3, Westbrook, Lillard, Mitchell, etc., are better. * &lt;insert tired double team, pickup game joke&gt;. * Corny response. * Win more.  Play better? CP3, Westbrook, Lillard, etc., are better THIS SEASON?      **The only other players in NBA history to average 27 PPG and 6 APG on 50% shooting in a season are LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Steph Curry and Oscar Robertson.**      **No NBA player had ever averaged 27 PPG and 6 APG on 60 TS% and missed the All-Star Game until Devin Booker.**  Devin Booker’s true shooting percentage is 10.8 points higher than Russell Westbrook. Booker bested Westbrook in every single important advanced metric and shooting efficiency.   Here’s how Devin Booker ranks in advanced metrics compared to his competition for an All-Star spot (Mitchell, Paul, Ingram, Westbrook, Morant):     PER = 1st   TS% = 1st   VORP = T2nd   BPM = 2nd   OBPM = 1st   WS = 2nd   PPG = 1st   How the hell do so many of you idiots exist, much less reply on this post when you CLEARLY don't know a damn thing about Devin Booker. You clearly don't know how amazing the guy is. He's having a top 5 as it relates to offensive efficiency, ALL TIME season.     You should have your basketball knowledge cards checked and revoked at the /r/nba door. Damn fools."
"Money doesn't really matter if you're a bad team. Chris Paul holds value with his contract because he is a great leader and very-well respected point guard around the league. Disrespect to Russell Westbrook isn't making any sense when you consider he is improving his game every year. For example he listened his coaches this season and stopped chugging threes. He is taking the most efficient shots in his arsenal.  ""the lack of athletic talent"" ???? Have you ever watched Wall, brother? I'm asking in a serious way."
"No, some contracts are bad even when a player is still active. Russell Westbrook for example. CP3 for example. John Wall has a bad contract. It's just worst when you realize he has health concerns, is getting older, and hasn't done much to improve his game to compensate for the lack of athletic talent. Paying 38% of your salary cap to John Wall for a good not great team is bad management."
1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Stephen Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. James Harden 8. Paul George 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Damian Lillard 11. Joel Embiid 12. Klay Thompson 13. Russell Westbrook 14. Chris Paul 15. Luka Doncic
"So Mitchell the guy who average 4 ast is a better playmaker than book who averages 6.5? Or Russell Westbrook who’s had one Good offensive month this season while booker has been elite the entire season, Russ also plays bad defense as well but I Guess that don’t matter for him, they’re 4-7 in the last 11 because harden has played bad, it’s not like Russ has been carrying them to wins, you take his best teammate away and what do you know even when he plays well they still lose. Booker is far superior to Russ and Mitchell on offense, the gap between book and Russ in efficiency is so fuckin giant it’s absurd, Russ had one great month and makes it over book who’s been great every month. Your points are week because some of the ppl who made it over him aren’t good defenders either and some aren’t better players makers and none are even remotely close when you count scoring and efficiency."
Tell me that this season’s versions of Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook would have unquestionably both made it in if they weren’t Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook
He's the best defender on Denver besides Gary Harris.   He's also the Russell Westbrook stopper. No surprise to me he also shutdown Donovan.
"Plus one to everything that FireLordEustace said.  And fine, I'll give you another one. John Hollinger - former Grizzlies Exec and one of the NBA's greatest analytical minds (he literally invented PER and other advanced stats) [said a week ago that he was leaving Russ off his ballot](https://theathletic.com/1556635/2020/01/23/hollingers-nba-all-star-picks-the-western-conference-selections/). (Spoiler alert: He included CP3, and gave Booker the last spot).  It's the Athletic so it's behind a paywall, but here's the relevant part:  &gt;Russell Westbrook is a big name who puts up big counting stats (those 25-8-7 averages pretty much jump off the page). Yet on many nights he has done as much harm as good for the Rockets. Don’t get me wrong, you’d rather have him on your team than not.   &gt;   &gt;But the decline in his shooting ability starting three years ago has really changed his value proposition as a player — he’s down to 23.5% from 3 this season. Because of that, he’s become a guy who nobody guards off the ball. Even inside the arc, he hasn’t quite been good enough (50.2%) to truly punish teams for leaving him to stop James Harden. Throw in his reckless gambling on defense, and there’s less here than meets the eye, despite his huge stats."
"I honestly don’t understand what you’re saying. I was obviously just poking fun at the fact that Donovan out up a bad game on the same day that he got an all-star nod while Booker got snubbed. Let me be clear, Mitchell is a stud and 100% deserving of the all-star spot. I don’t even think that he took Book’s spot. I think that honor goes to Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook.   It’s clear that wins matter and it’s hard to argue against that when the Suns are 20-27. It just sucks as a fan when you’ve seen a player develop the way Booker has that doesn’t get the recognition that he deserves. He’s absolutely an All-Star caliber player and him not making it this year is a major blow. There have been a lot of problems with the Suns during his tenure, and he hasn’t been one of them. It can literally all be predicated on our precious GM for being one of the worst executives in the history of American Sports and an owner that is held in a similar regard.    It must be nice being a fan of a good team. I’d do anything to see the Suns get to the same level."
"He definitely doesn't deserve it over Luka or Harden.  So that leaves Dame, Mitchel, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook   Dame 29/4/8 on 62% ts  Mitchell 25/4/4 on 56% ts, and has led the jazz to 4th in the west.  Paul 17/5/7 on 60% ts, has somehow led the thunder to 7th and is actually a plus defender, unlike Booker.   Westbrook 26/8/7 on 53% ts, team in 6th.  Booker very clearly got knocked for his defense and the record of his team. Dame is the only guard who got in in the west with a losing record, and he has better stats than Booker.  Paul is really the only person you could argue he deserves to be on the team over, but Paul's record and defense edged him out."
"Tracy McGrady is a tough comparison because at age 31, he was almost out of the league.   [Let's compare AI and RW at age 31.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Allen+Iverson&amp;player_id1_select=Allen+Iverson&amp;y1=2007&amp;player_id1=iversal01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players) Coincidentally, 06-07 was the season AI got moved to Denver. His USG% was lower, his VORP was higher, his WS were higher, though only marginally so /48. His TS was better, his 3P% was better, his TOV% was lower and his FTr was a lot better.  [Comparing their MVP stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Allen+Iverson&amp;player_id1_select=Allen+Iverson&amp;y1=2001&amp;player_id1=iversal01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y2=2017&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players) is tougher in my opinion. This was pre-hand check era basketball and the pace was a lot slower. We also didn't have the advanced stats available. Iverson averaged over [31 a game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2001_per_game.html) and we thought that was impressive enough for the MVP. Looking at the [00-01 advanced stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2001_advanced.html) paints a different picture. AI had the highest USG%, but his WS and VORP wasn't quite MVP caliber. Again, comparing across eras is tough. The 16-17 Thunder averaged around 7 possessions more than the 00-01 6ers. The game has since changed statistically. That's not to take away from Westbrook's MVP season. It really was remarkable. But AI was no slouch and dragged his team to the finals that year whereas Russ got trounced in the 1st round.  Staning for Russ is just foolish when he's definitely not infalliable. His game has deteriorated and his poor BBIQ is a detrimant to his perfomance at the moment. Russ' prime attribute was his athleticism and that's simply not sustainable quite as long. His turnover rate is abysmal too. I wonder if Morey would repeat that trade today, maybe he should've purused PG13."
"If you are making it about points/rebounds/assists per game, then I think you are kinda saying exactly the best argument for making Westbrook an All-Star.  &amp;#x200B;  It's Russell Westbrook. As we've seen, there's gonna be an avalanche of ""they're clearly wrong about him!!!"" posts whatever they decide on him. He's a hard-going, triple-double-averaging superstar."

"Looks like Russell ""not enough support from teammates"" Westbrook had teammates but just didn't know how to use them"
"Westbrook has absolutely not been a lock since mid-December or even a few weeks ago. In a Lowe Post podcast just a couple of weeks ago, Zach Lowe included CP3 on his ballot and left off Russ, saying ""there is no statistical case for Russell Westbrook to make the all-star team."" Because he's inefficient, advanced stats hate him, and he's putting up big numbers as a second option on a weird, streaking team.  CP3 has played well and absolutely elevated the play of everyone around him, leading a team many expected to be at the bottom of the west to a playoff position. He's having a better year."
"Most Thunder fans have a massive soft spot for Russ, and many NBA analysts have been saying CP3 is having a better season.  In a recent Lowe Post in early January, Zach said ""there is no statistical case for \[Russell Westbrook\] to make the all star game."" [Article Post](https://fadeawayworld.net/2020/01/14/zach-lowe-thinks-russell-westbrook-is-not-an-all-star-this-year/) ([Podcast in Question](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play/_/id/15104125)) Russ has been on a tear recently, but CP3 is probably doing more for his team as a whole."
"Because he is the easy pick for someone who isn’t studying over the NBA. It’s not like anyone will make a big stir over it and he’s been there for years and years. So a coach or realistically the assistant coach/intern sees Russell Westbrook on the ballot they leave a checkmark and go on with their day. At least that’s what I think, cause it’s apparent Booker has been better this season imo."
Russell Westbrook deserves to be a starter
Honestly guy is a really good playmaker and passer. He has some Kidd passing ability tbh and that Russell Westbrook athletic style of attacking the rim. I think he is a mix kf Kidd and Westbrook fmo. He can honestly really pass. I could say rondo too.
"I agree, and also.. DeMar DeRozan over Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook over Booker is a travesty
"Russell Westbrook isn’t better than D-Book, change my mind."
"Rockets are a sixth seed (and recently Westbrook has been the best player on the Rockets) . And the Jazz are the four seed. Suns are the eleven seed and 7 wins away from .500.  I just pulled all four of their current seasons to compare. I don’t think you can accurately say Booker is killing him statistically. Not one of those seasons stands out high above the others, in either box or advanced, and they are all winning besides Booker.   To make the case one is clear cut statisticallybetter, you gotta cherry pick the stats you want. And ignore the eye test.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id1_select=Chris+Paul&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id1=paulch01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Donovan+Mitchell&amp;player_id3_select=Donovan+Mitchell&amp;y3=2020&amp;player_id3=mitchdo01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Devin+Booker&amp;player_id4_select=Devin+Booker&amp;y4=2020&amp;player_id4=bookede01&amp;idx=players"
"Ever thought of a reason Harden is playing bad. How come every single player gets better once they are leave Westbrook and get worse with him? How come that OKC is now right where they were with him and PG13? I mean, come on. Also he has been atrocious barring last month. Atrocious. You can't just show up for a month and make an all star game. Devin is averaging 27 6 with 50% from the field, most of those shots pretty difficult and also he doesn't have the James Harden next to him to carry for three months. He is more efficient and arguably done better for his team since he made Kelly Oubre and Aron Baynes look like awesome players. It's all about the context and IMO, Russell is one of the most detrimental players to his own teams in the history of the league, and Rockets are feeling what that looks like. He will continue to take more shots than two of the best scorers in the history of the game, he did it with KD he will do it to Harden. He will take more shots and not blink, while being one of the worst shooters and decision makers NBA had ever seen. I could write for two days and not lose an inspiration because Russell is that overrated and that bad."
DeMar DeRozan over Russell Westbrook.
"For anyone who can't find a proper list of the starters + reserves + potential snubs  **EAST**   STARTERS:  - Backcourt Kemba Walker - Backcourt Trae Young - Frontcourt Giannis Antetokounmpo* (captain) - Frontcourt Pascal Siakam - Frontcourt Joel Embiid  RESERVES:  Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Ben Simmons, Khris Middleton, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis  POTENTIAL SNUBS:   Bradley Beal, Fred VanVleet, Devonte Graham, Andre Drummond, Zach LaVine, Malcolm Brogdon, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nikola Vucevic  **WEST**  STARTERS:  - Backcourt Luka Doncic - Backcourt James Harden - Frontcourt LeBron James* (captain) - Frontcourt Anthony Davis - Frontcourt Kawhi Leonard  RESERVES:  Damian Lilliard, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Brandon Ingram, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul  POTENTIAL SNUBS:   Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Karl Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Hassan Whiteside, LaMarcus Aldridge"
All that matters are jersey sales and TV ratings. The idiots who don’t really follow basketball know who Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook are. These same people couldn’t pick Book out of a lineup. And that is unfortunately the NBA is target demographic for watching the All-Star game.
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Are there actually people on r/NBA who think Booker is better than Russell fucking Westbrook. Holy shit I can't
"Between Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook, you think they gave Russ the lifetime achievement award...?  Also, they gave the Jazz the ""hey, you were #2 for a week so here's 2 all-stars"" award."
Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook over Booker. Really.

To make the finals? Extremely unlikely. It’s the Lakers and Clippers at this point.  To get out of the first round? James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Statistically speaking they’re still the [third best offensive team in the nba](https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=OFF_RATING&amp;dir=-1)
I’d take D’Angelo Russell over Russell Westbrook

"Yes, because that’s what Russell Westbrook was definitely trying to do. He was just trying to lose games by putting points on the board, assisting teammates, and rebounding the ball as a 6’3 point guard. How you can be this dumb and still manage to type a coherent sentence is beyond me"
&gt;Wikepedia says Russell Westbrook is named after his father but his name isn’t Damian Lillard so I’m a confused  This comment is so savage lmao
I think itd be pretty close to peak r/nba if we decided Russell Westbrook was better than James Harden after a month of basketball
"I think The Kobe Bryant All-Star MVP Award would at least be a little motivating.   Imagine LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, and Trae Young all playing in the all-star game.   I think those dudes would go *a little bit* harder for the Kobe Award than some no-name meaningless trophy.  Plus, it kinda fits with Kobe’s whole ethos. “Give 100% in this meaningless game. These are the best of the best? Distinguish yourself among them.”"

I’m surprised Russell Westbrook didn’t ask security to remove Damian Lillard from the game because he was being emotionally abused.
"""Russell Westbrook was drafted before Dame, therefore his longevity through this point - at which both are still active - is clear evidence of the superiority of his future legacy."""
Narrative that Russell Westbrook is a chucker. However Houston is one of the contenders that's severely overlooked.
Wikepedia says Russell Westbrook is james after his father but his name isn’t Damian Millard so I’m a confused
This honestly feels like Russell Westbrook is playing with the 2017 Thunder. Man has been trying to carry this team for like the past 10+ games
Damian “Russell Westbrook” Lillard
Can Russell Westbrook for once get some fucking help. This team is fucking hopelsss my god.
"anyone who doesn't love russell westbrook is mean. he cares so much, and pushes until he's got nothing left. he seems like such a high quality person"

"&gt;Nobody's out to get Clippers fans   &gt;   &gt;I swear 50% of 'Clipper fans' on here weren't even fans last year   &gt;   &gt;how arrogant they are  Totally man. We're barely on here, yet we're all of a sudden 'arrogant.'   There's legit heavily upvoted threads on how 'boring' our team is. There's threads clowning Kawhi for his load management yet Russell Westbrook has been doing the same thing all year.  We've literally just defended our own team and we get met with downvotes. Don't get your panties in a bunch when I simply gave you a reason."
"&gt;His TS is also deflated by his unnaturally low free throw percentage. He might not be a good shooter but I doubt he’ll shoot 35% from the line the rest of the year.  FTs use possessions. His FTs don't deflate his TS%. There's no such thing as deflating a TS%. It's a measure of efficiency. That's like me saying ""Russell Westbrook missing shots deflates his TS%."" Like yeah, missing shots is bad.  Even if he had gone 0-0 from the line, he has a slightly below average TS% in his last 2 games  I'll take the guy that can pass, dribble, shoot, and dunk over the guy that right now is just athletic as far as ceiling goes"
Like Russell Westbrook.
"I'm going stick with the theory that Norm was a nice Bruin who only became an asshole after getting into the NBA.  And if not, I hear Russell Westbrook is a swell guy.  Countdown to the clown leaving but I fear the damage has been done.  Seems like there's no light at the end of the mediocrity tunnel.  Seriously how can any AD spend nearly 20 years at Westwood and not even make it to one Rose Bowl.  Nevermind winning it but actually just getting to the game.  Need to switch to the UCLA sub to rant..."
"If russell westbrook could average a triple double this era, d wade would do fine."
"People really underestimating PRIME wade.  He was silky smooth, super athletic, could finish at the rim at any angle.  Not only that but he was a great playmaker/passer and was extraordinary defensively. Also, he wasn't a bad shooter per se.  He could hit the mid range fairly well and had a nice jumpshot.  If russell westbrook could average a triple double this era, d wade would be crushing the game.  These are a few players who would be great in any era and i think wade would be one of them."

"Man. It was just...as a Celtics fan, I knew we didn’t have to face Kobe year in year out like the Spurs or Suns (we admittedly had our own problems just getting past the buzzsaw of Lebron in the East), but I always envisioned the ultimate success as “beating Kobe”. Always. It was quite literally my definition of “success”, and though everyone around me would tell you the same thing, we’d be lying if we said we could ever visualize what it would look like in reality to actually DO THAT - to BEAT KOBE.  It just seemed impossible, because he’d always. figure. out. a. way. to. win. When the C’s won in 08’, I couldn’t quite believe it - so much so, that 2010’s game 7 loss to Kobe’s Lakers seemed to be destiny. You couldn’t beat that man twice, healthy, in the finals.   No matter what game face or performance opponents put on - no matter how many times you’d watch KG headbutt the basket stanchion, or Lebron throw his pregame chalk up in the air, or watch Iverson, Duncan, McGrady, Nash, Dirk, DWade, Pierce, Dwight, Melo, CP3, KD, Kawhi, Curry, Westbrook, Harden or Giannis showcase their own virtuosic takes on basketball perfection, you just knew that somewhere along the line, they were doing so in order to meet the expectations that Kobe set. Kobe was not the greatest player ever (close), but in my opinion, his game was the most beautiful and aesthetic to watch, and his presence was pure electricity. Every time he came into town (yes, even in Boston or NY), it was as if someone of the caliber of a president or world leader was visiting.   I absolutely cannot believe the man is gone. I used to watch way back in the mid 90’s with my dad and little bro. He’s been a constant presence in my life, without me even realizing it, and I truly thought he’d be amongst the world’s greatest “oldsters” (a la Bill Russell and Kareem), spouting world wearied wisdom and truth at very turn.   I guess it just isn’t so though. He’s frozen in time now as a complete and utter symbol of excellence worldwide."
Wilt Chamberlain and Russell Westbrook
"That's the center you dummy, and not Westbrook  No as for why he has D'Angelo Russell at center for the Celtics, your guess is as good as mine"

"If you look at the last 15 games:  \- Harden shoots 61% on above 34% usage  \- 18,4 points per game are scored off his assists  \- Rockets have great score when Harden is on court and awful score when he is off court  \- They also have a bad score when Russell ""better"" Westbrook is on court without Harden  &amp;#x200B;  I really don't grasp how this whole ""Harden is not good now"" story actually developed to popularity."

"Im older in my 30s. I saw every MJ title, Shaq in 99-02, LeBron 09-13 &amp; 2014-2017. Barkley is one of the 10 or so most legit motherfuckers of my life   Barkley was the only player in the 90s that MJ couldn't intimidate on any level. Glove's tricks backfired on him. The entire Knicks and Heat organizations tried to submit Michael. Drexler and Kemp and Ewing and Malone went toe to toe with Mike, and came away realizing that they didn't have that level in them, and it changed their careers.   Charles against MJ was insane. Chuck was like a loudmouth kid who picks fights all the time, he loved getting trash talked, so he could have his turn. He would smile and widen his eyes while jawing at dudes in huge playoff games with the same unfazedness as when he was playing cards on the bus.   Charles wasn't afraid of the moment. He would take any 3, post up any player. He would bow his head and run a 1 on 3 fastbreak like a maniac thinking dunk all the way, and no one could stop him from doing it. He was the first player I could remember who earned those ""over the shoulders"" ""he's too fucking strong"" fouls that Shaq and LeBron and Giannis would later get.   Charles was like a 6'5"" thickset bowling ball version of Russell Westbrook. I'm biased and think Paul Pierce is the toughest player I've ever watched, but Barkley is in that stratosphere.   Don't ever let TNT shenanigans make you forget how badass Charles was as a player. He's comfortable being corny and humorous and open sleeved now because his balls are bulletproof and unassailable. I had Pippen and Reggie Lewis and Reggie Miller jerseys because of their style, I worshipped Kemp dunks, but when I went to play league ball I would put on either the black Bulls MJ or the Philly Barkley jersey to feel like the Man. I swear I hit more ""game winners"" in the driveway when I pretended to be Barkley than anyone else.   Writers like Sam Smith and Bill Simmons legit believe MJ's psychopathic competitiveness was threatened by Charles more than any of his 90s rivals. And that Mike flattered Barkley, befriended him, and let him take spotlights. To puff him up and make him feel good.   The baddest ass of all time, Michael Jeffrey Jordan, the withering world eating bully who emotionally destroyed multiple millionaire profesional athletes. Wanted to keep his biggest enemy happy and keep a close on him.  For younger fans, imagine if Kobe had a rival/frienemy (besides his teammates). Imagine if Paul Pierce or Tmac or someone would regularly have heavyweight fights against Kobe for a decade. And couldn't be intimidated by him at all.   Kobe befriending Wade and LeBron in the 08 Olympics, convincing them their teams didn't have it in them to be champions. That was probably an MJ/Barkley Jedi mind trick he bit from Mike, to keep them at bay for the last few years of his prime"
"Really happy for CP3 and Russell Westbrook, the move really helped them both, especially CP3. What Lebron is doing at his age is phenomenal but CP3 is nothing short of that either!"
"no clue why you’re getting emotional and dodging all of the points i’ve made. Russell Westbrook:  -	is a better 3 point shooter -	is better in literally every facet of the game -	has made the playoffs every year since KD left his team, which curry is incapable of doing -	won MVP after KD left, which Curry can’t do  the list goes on and on..... let the facts sink in"
mhm and Russell Westbrook and Harden can't work because OnLy OnE baLL
You do realize they have Russell mofo Westbrook right?
"Or you're just stupid? The comment that started this chain is this is Harden's worst year since 2016. The person I referred to tried to refute it by saying that he's playing better defense than 2017 and is more efficient this year. He's not playing better than 2017. He's just making more free throws. What happens in the playoffs every year? His free throws goes down.  What matters more at the end of games when refs swallow their whistles? Making shots. He's not making regular shots but he's making more free throws which isn't sustainable. Any game where he doesn't get a ton of free throws, you're sure to lose. He shot his season average for free throws last night and lost.  For example, would you rather have Russell Westbrook with the ball in his hands right now or James Harden? By your logic, James Harden. His post all star TS% is 59.4. Russell Westbrook even though he's shooting 52.8/40/70 TS% is 57.5."
"His efficiency is down. Last year he was an unbelievable 64% TS, down to an amazing 60%. That’s a big drop. If he dropped another 4% next year, he’ll basically be Russell Westbrook (chucking 24 shots for 30 PPG and raking in rebounds for an MVP trophy). It’s because he’s taking (and missing) more threes.  He’s added 2.7 shots per game and only making 0.9 more shots. That’s 33% on those extra shots. He’s taking 1.9 extra threes per game, and shooting 30% from three.  TL:DR- Giannis added 1.9 3PA and 0.8 2PA to his game and is averaging 1.9 more points. His total efficiency is still elite, but comparing it to last year is not the same."
Im pretty sure I remember woj tweeted about it after the trade went down  Edit: https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2844408-woj-raptors-rejected-russell-westbrook-paul-george-for-pascal-siakam-trade.amp.html
"Zach Lowe is sneakily a Sexton stan   [From March 22, 2019](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26320441/ten-things-like-including-terrifying-giannis):  &gt;  &gt; 3. It's time to talk about Collin Sexton &gt;  &gt; Sexton is kinda starting to happen. His 3-point shooting -- up to 42 percent -- has been a slow-burn shocker. It began with Sexton canning open 3-pointers when defenders ignored him, or ducked 10 feet below screens. He had time to check the wind. Skeptics shrugged.  &gt; Beyond that, there is just something to like about Sexton. He is fearless, and the best kind of cocky. I sat courtside in Philly last Friday as an undermanned Cleveland team battled the Sixers to the final buzzer. Philly was visibly disinterested. That annoyed and emboldened the Cavs, especially Sexton. They wanted to punish the Sixers for their arrogance. &gt;  &gt; Sexton scored 26 in that game, and he demanded the ball on every crunch-time possession. He genuinely did not think any Sixer could stop him. He plays with a ferocious opportunism a little reminiscent of Russell Westbrook:   [From Oct 11, 2019:  ](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27807188/the-2019-20-nba-league-pass-rankings-pt-1)  &gt; One of my random vivid memories from last season: watching from courtside on March 12 in Philadelphia as Collin Sexton kept the Cavs -- without Kevin Love -- close against a full-strength Philly team acting as if that game was beneath it. &gt;  &gt; I fell a little in love with Sexton that night. He sensed Philly's disdain. It fueled him. He went at Joel Embiid and talked trash, chin-to-chest, during dead balls. He demanded the ball on every fourth-quarter possession, and produced: 26 points on 11-of-20 shooting. &gt;  &gt; He also had one assist. A Sexton-Darius Garland backcourt is going to chuck wacky shots as open teammates scream for the ball. At least Jordan Clarkson realized halfway through last season that passing is legal! &gt;  &gt; But Sexton has something you can't teach -- a little Westbrookian bravado that, if channeled the right way, can lift everyone around him. &gt;  &gt;   From Today:   &gt; 7. Collin Sexton is learning stuff &gt;  &gt; Sexton since Jan. 1: 23.3 points per game on 48.4% shooting, and 46% from deep -- including 48% on 2.1 pull-up 3s per game. He has even boosted his assists and free throws from ""pathetic"" to ""low but less worrisome."" &gt;  &gt; He's inching forward as a passer; he recorded a season-high (for him) 19 potential assists Wednesday against Boston, and his three best games by that metric have come since the All-Star break, per Second Spectrum. (Related: Darius Garland has missed Cleveland's past two games.) His defense is a problem, though he has been friskier lately. Nothing so far indicates he will ever be a top-two player on a championship-level team. &gt;  &gt; But Sexton just turned 21, and he's sprinkling in hints of improving craft -- including an effective lefty hesitation dribble: &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Teams duck screens against Sexton a fair bit, and he needs a better counter than pulling up for long 2s. This is one: hesitate behind that screen to map the floor and see if the defense exhales. If it does, Sexton crouches into a speed dribble, zips by the first line of defense, and makes a play. &gt;  &gt; Sexton is also cagier bobbing back-and-forth behind second and third screens -- another must-have counter to the ""go under"" defense."
"&gt; Paired with Zion, Ball seems to be enjoying himself more. Statistically, the two get along: Since Zion’s debut on January 22, Ball’s production has jumped in almost every category. He’s averaging 2.1 more assists (8.4 per game), 1.2 more rebounds (7.0), and 0.5 more points (12.6) despite 1.5 fewer field goal attempts (10.2). His efficiency has skyrocketed: Ball was hitting 35.5 percent of his shots from deep and 39.0 percent overall before Zion came back to the court; since then those numbers are at 42.7 percent and 44.8 percent.  &gt; Coach Alvin Gentry has played Zion with Ball [more](https://stats.nba.com/lineups/advanced/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;GroupQuantity=2&amp;TeamID=1610612740&amp;sort=MIN&amp;dir=1&amp;DateFrom=01%2F22%2F2020&amp;DateTo=03%2F05%2F2020) than he has with any other teammate, maybe because he pays attention to advanced analytics (the Pelicans have a phenomenal net rating of plus-14 when the two share the floor) or maybe because the reasons that the two work are very simple. One is programmed to pass, and the other can score over—sometimes through—anyone. It’s also easier for Ball to run around the perimeter undetected while multiple defenders are gawking at Zion.  &gt; [. . .]  &gt; The shots wouldn’t be falling if Ball hadn’t fixed his shooting form, and they really wouldn’t be falling if he were still hesitant to take them. There’s an immeasurable new confidence about Ball. I don’t know that he’ll ever be the kind of self-assured scorer that Damian Lillard or Russell Westbrook is, the type who blankly stares into the camera after ending a player’s career a second earlier. But [this is the most commanding that I’ve ever seen Ball look.](https://mobile.twitter.com/jackfrank_jjf/status/1234295137611567106)"

Random Russell Westbrook Stat: Basketball Reference recorded 14 instances of a player recording a triple double with 10+ turnovers. A less than stellar form of the quadruple double. Russell Westbrook has five of them. No one else has more than two.

Russell Westbrook is my best friend and I love him.  We’re married.
"Reminds me of AI's toughness (though Westbrook surpasses him in that, I think) which gets me thinking: who is the better player, all-time, when it's all said and done? Russell Westbrook or Allen Iverson?  Both have an MVP, lost in 1 Finals, and are multiple-time scoring champs. Comparable inefficiency and TOs, but are both incredible playmakers that turn nothing into something."
"Unless we’re talking Girl Scout cookies, Al Pacino movies or Stevie Wonder albums, everything has a saturation limit, or at least it should.  Is scoring in the NBA reaching that point?  For a league that was desperate to see scoring reach the 100s when games were slow marches to 90, the rules were opened up to increase scoring, limit overly physical play and display the athletes at their best.  That has had the desired effect — almost too well.  Every team is averaging well over 100 points per game (league average 111.4), with the Charlotte Hornets bringing up the rear at a measly 102 per night — the same production as the Miami Heat back in 2010-11.  Yes, that’s the first year of the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh partnership.  The game we’re watching nightly is so drastically different from the contests we saw even five years ago.  Remember that Stephen Curry bomb on Feb. 27, 2016, against the Oklahoma City Thunder in one of the greatest regular-season games of the decade? The 40-ish footer from barely a step inside of half-court that caught everyone off-guard, especially Anthony Roberson?  Well, LeBron James has hit shots from that zip code twice in the last week. The first was the “not yet, kid” triple Sunday that quieted the frenzied New Orleans crowd after Zion Williamson brought the house down with a dynamite dunk on a nationally televised game.  The second was a calm, walk-up triple Tuesday from the Los Angeles Lakers logo a couple nights ago.  The skill levels of the incumbent players as well as the young stars entering the league have been aided by the rules being so loose.  According to basketball-reference.com creator Justin Kubatko, February was the second month in league history in which six players — Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum and Damian Lillard — averaged 30 points or more.  The first month that occurred?  January 2020, with Kawhi Leonard and Devin Booker joining Lillard, Westbrook, Young and Beal.  Notice the names that haven’t been mentioned? Luminaries like James, Curry, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Curry has been out most of the year, but he could wind up on that list next year, and with Durant recovering from an Achilles injury, he could return to elite status next season.  For all we know, we could be in the most golden of golden eras of scoring, with talent like Zion Williamson and Luka Doncic ready to do more damage as time goes on.  But if these explosions are so commonplace, does it diminish how special it feels, especially with defenses not having much of a chance to earn the benefit of the doubt?  Whether it’s the “gather and two steps” rule or no more hand-checking or mere evolution, it feels like we’re in a juiced-ball era that would make the slow-down coaches of the ’90s cringe.  This isn’t opining to go back there, not by a long shot.  But maybe, just maybe, we can play some games on All-Madden once in a while?  OK, old man no longer yelling at cloud.  [Vincent Goodwill](https://sports.yahoo.com/is-there-too-much-scoring-in-the-nba-203352903.html)"
"The exceptions in those cases were:  1) MJ averaging 35 and winning DPOY at the same time  2) Russell Westbrook averaging the first triple double in forever, plus the other MVP front runners being on the same team.  3) Malone not being a top 2 seed even though his team was technically a top 2 seed."

Also, here’s a quote from harden:   ""A play like that, that always happens,"" said Rockets guard James Harden, who played with Westbrook for the Thunder for three seasons. ""In the game of basketball, when the opponents think the other team is going to call timeout, the guy tries to go for the steal. That happens on so many occasions, not just in the last game, but it's been happening for so many years in the league. It's just an unfortunate situation."""

"&gt; he once accidentally injured Russell Westbrook on a hustle play that players make all the time  Look, I know this is your first year watching basketball so you probably don't remember the play in question and aren't really sure what's typical and what isn't, but no, players do not dive at the opponent's knees after they've called a timeout all the time. And furthermore, Beverley didn't just do that shit once, he's gone after Westbrook a number of times over the years.  [On the play where he injured Westbrook](https://streamable.com/aeq3a), and really altered Westbrook's career as WB has had **six** different knee surgeries on that right knee ever since this incident, you can see that after Westbrook calls timeout, Beverley just dives at his knees, and then doesn't even turn around and just runs on to his bench. He didn't look back to see if there was a steal, a foul, if WB was hurt, nothing. He just dove at his knees and then ran away without even looking back. That's a bush league move.  Here's a few other times Beverley has done something dirty against Westbrook, and notice how every time he attacks him, he just immediately gets up afterward and walks away. He's a fake tough guy who wants to start shit, but can't back it up.  [Example 1](https://streamable.com/mrxz7)  [Example 2](https://streamable.com/038al)  [Example 3](https://streamable.com/lg7hv)"
"Nobody hates him for going out there and playing with intensity... redditors will create narratives for whatever they FEEL is true instead of what is actually true to bandwagon onto a rolling snowball.   He is hated for injuring players because of his absolutely unnecessary antics, notably Russell Westbrook. When is diving at someones knees a basketball play? Never."
"Petty of you to write totals while Russ played 2 less games. It shows how great he was this month.  LeBron per game in February: 26.0 points (49.7% shooting, 36.0% on 3s), 10.1 assists, 8.1 rebounds, 0.8 steals   Russell Westbrook: 33.4 points (54.9% shooting, 40.0% on 3s), 6.0 assists, 7.3 rebounds, 1.8 steals   And Russ rocked the baby on Lebron and AD in LA."
"&gt; plays recklessly and puts other players in danger  no he doesn't, he once accidentally injured Russell Westbrook on a hustle play that players make all the time and despite years of not injuring anybody (and I believe it was Kevin Durant making the same play for OKC literally the next night) haters have never let it go  &gt; He's a guy who loves to talk shit after his team wins a game, but won't say anything beforehand.  also not true, he's always consistently had the same attitude before games, after games, winning or losing -- this is just so blatantly false  &gt; He's a guy who loves to talk shit with the hope and expectation that his teammates back it up, rather than because he can.  There's nobody Bev expects more out of than himself and he's first to step forward, plus his teams play many times better with him on the floor and it's reflected in their record  &gt; And he's one of the most egregious floppers in the league.  lol  I swear to god, y'all gotta be *trying so hard* to know so little about a player but have such strong uninformed opinions of him. Or you just get the entirety of your NBA news from the front page of this sub."
"&gt; It boils down to “He should know his place”  He can do whatever the fuck he wants, I was just responding to the guy not understanding why some people here don't like him, and that wasn't the only thing I said. I also don't like his constant dirty play, his flopping and his whining to the refs. But no, I also don't like *any* player who runs their mouth and talks a lot of shit and can't back it up. Hell, I don't like *people* who do that, period, whether it's in sports or not.   Beverley's on a great team, but they're not great *because of him*, he's just along for the ride. He makes his contributions, sure, but he talks like people better watch out because he's coming for them. He helps the Clippers and is a quality role player, but he talks like he's an MVP candidate or something. It'll be absolutely hilarious if the Clippers deal him to some shitty team this summer and reality hits him full in the face.   Russell Westbrook was right: he really *did* trick some of y'all lol"

"It's very rare because they go to the best surgeons in the country, usually specialized in just one type of operation and injury. They had many operations of that kind and are very expert with them.   It used to happen more in the past. One more recent case was when Richard Steadman operated Danilo Gallinari who had to go through surgery again (with Steve Traina).  P.S. footballer Giuseppe Rossi, Russell Westbrook, Lindsey Vonn and Danilo Gallinari were all operated by Richard Steadman and all had problems again often needing a second surgery"
Russell Westbrook is currently a top.
I like Russell Westbrook!
Probably Russell Westbrook
People have been saying that Russell Westbrook is a low BBIQ player who just can't help chucking bad shots for basically his entire career. This sample and his last three months of basketball now that he's finally on a team of shooters kills that narrative dead.  You seem to be one of the only posters in this thread who doesn't understand that.
"Compared to Brook Lopez, Kelly Olynyk has the speed of Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook with no regard for human life. My god.
HOLY SHIT RUSSELL WESTBROOK WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT TO HIM
"James Harden at 40%, 0.5% off of RJ  Also Russell Westbrook  Giannis for his first two years"
Russell Westbrook has been on a revenge tour
Russell westbrook
"Just to prove you wrong and the people downvoting my comment. There have only been 20 times a player has average 30pts/4reb/6ast per game. 5 of those times, the player has won MVP. List of players on that list: Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Rick Barry, Steph Curry, Dwyane Wade, Russell Westbrook and James Harden  So ya.. MVP numbers"
"I agree that if LeBron were born into an earlier generation, his mentality would be a little different. I mean you are who you are, but he wouldn't have been nearly as pampered. The other question is if LeBron would have went to college. The high school thing wasn't as popular until the KGs, Kobes, and McGradys. How many years are we moving LeBron back? It's very interesting.  I agree with your LeBron takes. I'm not sure I disagree with any of your criticisms. We're on the same page. It's splitting hairs once you get to the cream of the crop. Though I can poke holes in his game and career, I can do the same for virtually every player, including Jordan. Give me Kobe 10 times out of 10 over LeBron. I just think being as unbiased as possible and taking everything into account, LeBron has a legitimate argument to be ranked higher.  How many rings did LeBron leave on the table? From 2011 on, I only hold 2011 against him. No one can blame him for losing to Golden State in 2007, 2015, 2017, or 2018 with the odds stacked against him. He did flame out in 2010 against the Celtics, but Kobe and the Lakers barely beat them in 7 games. I don't hold 2008 against him considering Kobe also lost to the Celtics with a better team. 2009? The Lakers were winning that year regardless. You can say he stacked the deck in favor of his Heat teams. Sure.  He's very passive aggressive and it reflects in his style of play. You know what's funny? Oscar Robertson loves LeBron's game. He thinks he's better than Jordan and has said so several times. Oscar played similar to LeBron, minus the god-like athleticism. Oscar prefers their style of play. Oscar was accepted as the GOAT perimeter player for the 60s, 70s, and a lot of the 80s. Whose to say he's wrong?  I loved the Lakers vs OKC battles from 2010-2012. They were amazing. Westbrook went at Kobe relentlessly and Kobe loved it. Kobe has always sung high praises to the original OK3 core. That was the point that I knew Westbrook would be my guy once Kobe faded into retirement.  I agree that Westbrook's gears sometimes hurt him. I attribute a lot of that to his lack of having a great coach. It's hard for a lot of people to accept, but Jordan is not Jordan without Phil Jackson. He would still put up GOAT numbers, but the rings would not be as stacked. People were calling Jordan the GOAT before the Dream Team, but a lot of Jordan's arguments as GOAT lie in the 6 for 6 points. The same applies to Kobe. Reality is that all-time great coaching matters for player's legacies. You have to wonder how different Westbrook would be had he played for a Jackson, Auerbach, Riley, or Pop or even a Larry Brown or Chuck Daley for that matter. Westbrook never played in a real system until this season.  Shaq over Jordan for a #1 pick is not all that crazy considering Olajuwon was drafted over Jordan and the Rockets don't regret it at all. I was never a big Shaq guy, but his 2000 season is one of the greatest of all time without question. I've always attributed a lot of Shaq's championship success to forces around him (Kobe, Wade, Phil, Riley). There's the Orlando run in 95, but that's about it for me. Then again I always said Kareem's championship success had more to do with his guards and coaching as well. Not to take anything away from them though. It's somewhat the nature of the position.  To me, Shaq does virtually nothing better than Chamberlain. Chamberlain is the guy where if you lined up everyone in a gym at their best, he's #1 considering size matters a ton. I understand how hard it is comparing them because their peak was essentially 33 years apart (Wilt in 67, Shaq in 2000). The 3 point line didn't even exist. Basketball was so different. However, a lot of comparisons with older players has recency bias and unfortunately there is lack of video. Take player like Curry and Westbrook. Their peaks are 2016 and 2017. Can they be compared to Magic and Bird? Bird peaked in 1986 and Magic peaked in 1987. Exactly 30 years apart. A lot of people would say they can be compared and they play in 2 different versions of basketball too.  Here's my rant on why Wilt is so great. If you divide basketball into 4 tangible aspects you get: scoring, rebounding, playmaking, and defense. There are subsections and intangibles, but let's stick to the tangibles. Scoring - It doesn't take anyone more intelligent than a monkey to realize that Wilt is one of the greatest scorers of all-time. You think his era was easier? Fine. Subtract some points. You have to get real irrational to take him out of the top 5 (he's top 2). Rebounding. He's #1. Even by rebounding percentages, he's still consistently at the top. Playmaking. Still the only center to lead the league in assists in an era where assist counting was more strict. He wasn't consistently like Jokic or Sabonis, but if he wanted to be, he could. Defense. He wasn't consistently like Bill Russell, but the Lakers Wilt was pretty darn close to the best defender ever. Bill Russell said so himself. At minimum, Sixers and Lakers Wilt is a top 5 center defensively ever. Add that all up and he's in the conversation for best ever in every tangible measurement of basketball skill. Who else can you say that for? He had some issues with his intangibles and a weakness (free throw shooting), but everything else is top notch. He certainly can do more that others can't.  Shaq is certainly the GOAT center of the ""modern"" era. I guess that depends on what you consider Kareem. (Side note - I always found it silly how people are comfortable considering Kareem modern when he played against Wilt only 2-3 years removed from his prime and won his first championship with an ancient guard in Oscar Robertson). Your reasoning for a center over Jordan is valid the same way the holy trinity of centers were ranked over perimeter players in Oscar, West, Baylor in the old days. Size trumps all if everything else is relatively close. Overall, I vacillate between Jordan and Bill Russell for my first pick."
It is when we're talking about Russell Westbrook.
"well its a 7 foot center guarding Russell Westbrook, so you can see how that might favor russ 1v1. It was a team defense move by Utah, obviously, not a shut down russell westbrook move (it didnt work). Carry on wit da narratives"
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook.  Man just imagine having all these guys together.  Easy dynasty."
"not disagreeing, but look at their usage. They're both putting up like russell westbrook/James harden level usage in their second seasons. You can't expect zion to have that level of usage, its pretty abnormal."
You would take Russell Westbrook over Kawhi?
- 2017 Russell Westbrook - 2014 Kevin Durant - 2012 LeBron James - 2008 Kobe Bryant - 2006 Steve Nash - 2002 Tim Duncan  That's 6 of the last 18 MVP awards. MVP goes to someone other than the best player on the best regular season team regularly enough.
"I really don't see Luka winning, basically because I don't see the Mavs as a Top 2 team in the NBA in the next 3 seasons.  In order to be the MVP, you have to be one of the Top 3 teams in your conference. Usually, for the past 10 years, the MVP was on the team with the best record in the League.   16-17 Westbrook was an anomaly, as OKC finished 6th in the West but Russell was absurd, with 42 Triple-Doubles (most in history) + the first guy to avg a triple-double since Oscar Robertson.  So, from those names, the one's with the most realistic shots are Kawhi, Jokic or AD."
"The court is space perfect for Russ to do what he does best, which is get downhill and attack the paint. His game is efficient and he looks under control and not really forcing the issue. Not sure if its his best season, but [I love this version](https://www.buzzsprout.com/794936/2865781) of Russell Westbrook. He's like their Center on offense with shooters spaced around him.

Also going 5 out spaces the court nicely for teams that want to double team Harden and then they make teams pay by hitting a three off the double, or it lets Russ go one on one. Plus a big guy out of the ""Dunker"" spot or in the paint has made it even easier for him since Capela got traded. I read an [article](https://www.nba.com/article/2020/02/28/kia-mvp-ladder-feb-28-edition) the other day saying that they're the team ever Western Conference coach should be scared of. I have become a fan of the Rockets now because of this ""Pocket Rocket"" approach. I think this is the best system we've seen Russ utilized in and Dantoni and Morey deserve alot of credit for thinking outside the box. I mean this way works with their analytics and they have the right guys to make it work on defense(Covington and Tucker). This small ball gives them their best chance to beat either LA team, but I don't know if its going to be enough."

It’s true it would’ve been nice to see kd with a team like bkn before he tore his Achilles to get a clearer picture of if he can dominate in the playoffs like he has with gs on a less stacked team."

"Anyone except the one player who killed your organization and set them back a decade?  Seriously, how can you like Carmelo Anthony? He’s not fun to watch. He’s not uniquely talented in any significant way (say like a Russell Westbrook, or a Ben Wallace, or a Draymond Green). He’s not a winning player. He doesn’t make anyone around him better. He plays very little defense. He’s not a good teammate. His work ethic had never been anything to marvel at."
"Anthony Mason =  just imagine a 6'7, 200+lb Russell Westbrook.  Back in the early/mid 90s, this dude had the smoothest ball-control of any bigman, and he could finish on anyone. I swear, watching him go coast-2-coast was like seeing a tidal wave in the ocean, moving and flowing effortlessly in the open sea, then crashing onto the shore with the full-force of mother nature.  So why would Mason do better now than in the 90s? Well, he only spent his career going up against guys (offensively &amp; defensively) such as Kemp, Barkley, Malone, Grant, Wilkins, Rodman, Worthy and Grandmama. So against today's comp, Mason would be the most-physically-dominating force on the court. He'd make Zion look like Spud Webb."
"It’s a good thing you’re out, because you don’t understand basketball. I’m trusting the experts over some guy with a 6 day old account  Also, 2nd in shots isn’t bad when you’re 4th in scoring and attempt less free throws than those above you.... James harden and Russell Westbrook won mvps leading the league in turnovers  E: also he was actually 4th in shot attempts  You’re the typical r/nba user talking out their ass"
Russell Westbrook used to that. Thank goodness he slowed that down
It does spill over sometimes though. Marcus Thompson wrote about how some nba players resented Steph in his book (https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/stephen-curry-book-marcus-thompson-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-dislike-warriors/19tkdxqaeo40p1598n07undcew). He threw out a couple of names like Russ and Bron but in one of the podcasts he did to promote the book (i believe it was the old basketball friends pod with espn) he specifically singled out CP3 as someone who really does not like him
"Hey everyone, this guy thinks he has a “way better” jump shot than Russell Westbrook"
I just became Russell Westbrook with a wayyy better jump shot
"I mean my response was to somebody who claimed everybody who worked with Melo LOVED the dude.  That’s just patently false, with exemplars.   It’s honestly a pretty simple rationale. We’re all humans, we play sports, we like winning, and we like to be involved. Sharing the basketball is often set as the goal because it helps to achieve both those goals.   Melo is often described as a black hole. He likes facing his man head-on, and beating them 1 v 1. That doesn’t bode well for team chemistry, and in the NBA, that STILL DOES NOT MATTER, as long as he makes enough of those shots. See: James Harden.   Russell Westbrook gets a ton of slack as is for being a ball hog, and he’s still incessantly more effective than Melo is.   Had (some of) Melo’s ex-teammates not come out in support of Melo, I would’ve classified him as a locker room cancer, but even if I take the public support from his ex-teammates, I’m not going to do an entire 180 and prop him up to be a locker room glue guy. Glue guys are the Richard Jefferson’s and Serge Ibaka’s, they are basically high EQ individuals who happen to play basketball at the professional level. If they’re a really good glue guy, their personality off the court will often times still be likeable. Because they’re high EQ.   Melo’s definitely not in that boat."
Modern day (no particular order): Magic Johnson John Stockton Gary Payton Steve Nash Jason Kidd Russell Westbrook  Derek Rose Stephen Curry Isaiah Thomas Chris Paul  Old school honorable mention: Bob Cousy Jerry West Oscar Robertson
"Where to even begin? Firstly, how are you gonna try to contrast Harden and Wade and then go on and say that Harden needs the refs favor to be effective? The ability to draw fouls is something that Harden and Wade share in common. Before the Heatles--when wade was the man--, Wade averaged a FTr of about .513, Harden since he became the man in Houston has boasted a FTr of about .529. Clearly Harden is better at drawing fouls/freethrows, but the numbers don't lie. That was a big part of both their games. Wade practically won a finals off of freethrows. He averaged more than 16 per game for crying out loud. Apparently you can win a title fishing for fouls--wade already did it. Harden's postseason production in bulk isn't even bad. His game does translate to the playoffs pretty well all things considered. He just has specific moments and games where he lays a rotten egg.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly, your 2nd paragraph is probably worse than the first. How does the Rockets trading CP3 and capela prove that Harden only plays for stats? CP3 was traded for Russell Westbrook, a player who's even more ball dominant than CP3! And as for Capela, how is it wrong for a team to try to improve? Spacing is the most important aspect of the modern game and Capela provided none of that. Also, how are you gonna mention SSOL Suns' system as if it's inherently better than Morey Ball Rockets and then harp on the Rockets system for not being able to win a ring? The SSOL Suns went as far as the Moreyball Rockets. Arguably the Rockets even came closer considering that they were and injury away from the finals."
"Exactly, and I say that as a mega Russell Westbrook fan. I know how good Russ can be, but harden is for sure on a higher level."
"Russell Westbrook's college stats were kind of underwhelming so it was a bit of a shock at the time that he was taken 4th (some people didn't even expect him to be a lottery pick before the tournament, and even after an impressive showing there he was projected to be just barely top 10).  Thankfully Sam Presti was able to recognize that Westbrook was a lunatic that plays every game like he has 24 hours left to live, and what looked like a significant gamble at the time ended up being them correctly choosing not just a future MVP but literally the only All Star guard to come out of that entire draft (other than #1 pick D Rose of course)"
"Fertitta sucks dick and should sell the team to keep his equally shitty businesses afloat, sunk costs be damned. He won’t though. He’ll hold out as long as he can, until most of his low wage employees are as throughly fucked by the crisis as possible, then he’ll sell the rockets to some garbage cartel that will run the team into the ground while maximizing profit. Thus all of Fertitta’s employees, Rockets fans, and the careers of the Rockets players and staffs will be thoroughly ruined for some shithead fuck. Godspeed Russell Westbrook. I love you."
so that I can vote Russell Westbrook #7
"Also, a big thing about the league right now is each top team has a duo (two stars). Lakers have Lebron and Anthony Davis. Clippers have Kawhi and Paul George. Rockets have Harden and Russell Westbrook. Bucks have Giannis and Middleton.   There are also some really top players who are injured at the moment. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving"
"In the NBA, the Lakers and Celtics are always in style, and have been from the very beginning.   The Knicks have been suffering for 20 years, but are still a very popular team.   If you want to get on a hype-train at the right time, the Bucks are trending upwards. The Toronto Raptors are the defending champions, but  after the loss of superstar Kawhi Leonard, are not a favorite-- but still doing surprisingly well thanks to improvements from Pascal Siakam, Fred Van Vleet, and the reliable play of longtime Raptor Kyle Lowry.   The Warriors are a popular team having a down year, but might well bounce back next season. They have two of the best shooters in league history.   The Houston Rockets have offensive savant James Harden paired with another superstar, Russell Westbrook who is a walking triple double (pts, rebounds, assists). The LA Clippers have Kawhi Leonard (reigning Finals MVP) paired with star Paul George and some solid roleplayers.   New Orleans and Dallas are exciting young teams that should be fun to watch for a long time. Denver and Utah are solid teams.   The Spurs and Blazers are perennially great clubs having a rough year.   The Nets will be stronger next year with the return of Kevin Durant (two time finals mvp I think) and Kyrie Irving."
"A mix of pace, FG%, and shot selection gave centers/forwards giant rebound totals, basically. In 1965 teams averaged 103 shots on 43% from the field, plus FT rebounds for an average of 68 rebounds available per game. Today it's about 45 available rebounds per game.  Add in that shots were generally closer to the rim since there was no 3 point line, meaning rebounds usually fell a lot closer to the basket where centers and forwards were positioned. Back then it wasn't unusual for multiple guys on a team to average 10+ rebounds per game (the Knicks in 1966 had 4 10+ rpg players) or a guy averaging over 20 rebounds like Wilt, Russell, Jerry Lucas, Nate Thurmond, etc  Today long rebounds are a lot more common which helps give guys like Harden and Westbrook unusually high rebound numbers as guards, but in general rebounding numbers are down because teams get around 90 shots per game max and make closer to 45% of those shots."
I hope it was the embodiment of an entire 15 man roster made up of Russell Westbrook who elbowed that piece of shit.
"Hassan Whiteside  I get ridiculed every time I mention my love for the guy. Also fellow ""stat padder"" Russell Westbrook and third? How 'bout Chris Paul pre-OKC when everyone mocked all that money on the back end of his contract."
"There's also a bit of a Russell Westbrook in that Wilt was a bit more salty with the media so they tended to favor Bill Russell over Wilt though and the era favored players who were more ""for the team"" than they do now."
"Yeah I’d say the fact that Russell won most of the matchup as well is another good indicator at who was the better player.  Sometimes I wonder if all the footage of the modern era of the NBA gets deleted, and all we have left are stats, will people in 50 years argue that Westbrook or Harden were better than Steph because of their raw numbers?"
Is your name Russell Westbrook and your friends James Harden and Tyson Chandler?
It was like watching Chauncey Billups dunk like Russell Westbrook. Just a great power dunker at PG.
"I'm saying those accusations are simply not true. Jordan lost in the first round, is he a choker? Chokers don't make the NBA finals or WCF multiple times. They would choke and not make it.  That's why someone such as McGrady is a choker. Malone lost to Michael Jordan's Bulls in his finals appearance - that is just bad luck, not choking.   Other actual chokers in NBA history would be: Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, DeMarr Derozan, Carmelo, Elton Brand, Carlos Boozer.  Malone &amp; Stockton were on another level than these dudes because they consistently won playoff series that they were supposed to win"
Jrue Holiday or Russell Westbrook?
"His counting stats looked good as a rookie. But he was a very bad shooter and didn’t make his teammates better.  You know that extra 10% that makes Russell Westbrook amazing? DSJ didn’t have it. And he was a much worse shooter, passer, playmaker and defender than Westbrook"
I forgot how good he was. He was like a prototype for Russell Westbrook now. Hyper athletic scoring point guard.
If that’s the case I’ll make the 2nd super team.  PG: Stephen Curry SG:James Harden  SF:Kevin Durant PF:Giannis C:Anthony Davis  6th: Kawhi Leonard 7th:Klay Thompson 8th: Russell Westbrook  HC: Pop

"If that's the case, using your logic, then Russell Westbrook has basically never been a superstar either."
"Russell Wilson - Steph Curry (Both undersized and underrated. Both played a role in evolving the game. Extremely adaptable to their teammates.)   Tom Brady - LeBron James (All time greats who seem to ignore the effects of time. Enjoy silencing their critics who start to overlook them for younger talent.)   Aaron Rodgers - James Harden (Great players who are extremely talented, but are known for being the best at getting free plays.)   Lamar Jackson - Giannis Antetokounmpo (Unstoppable forces who are still evolving their game.)   Ryan Fitzpatrick - Lou Williams (Come off the bench and have the capability to absolutely light up the opponent.)   Patrick Mahomes - Luka Doncic (Electrifying players who have redefined what is expected of young players.)   Deshaun Watson - Damian Lillard (Clutch players who often get let down by the rest of the team.)   Drew Brees - Klay Thompson (Extremely accurate, always putting up good numbers, but usually overshadowed by others.)   Jameis Winston - Russell Westbrook (Love to fill up the stat sheet, especially the turnover column.)   Kyler Murray - Trae Young (Younger versions of already great players.)   Baker Mayfield  - Kyrie Irving (Known as much for his play on the court/field as off of it.)   Nick Foles - Kevin Durant (You add him to your team if you want a guaranteed win in the big games.)"
"Oh my god, Nash is the most overrated player in history. He is not a tier above prime Russell Westbrook."
Steph Curry - Russell Wilson  Both undersized wizards with the ball. Among the top tier in their positions and have both won titles. Have also lost titles in heartbreaking fashion (Kyries clutch 3 and Malcolm Butler INT)   Russell Westbrook -Tyreek Hill Electric with the ball. Both play the game at breakneck speed. Modern day cheetahs with the ball.    Lebron James - Tom Brady  Today's GOATS of each sport. Multiple title winners + multiple haters.    Kawhi Leonard - Aaron Donald  Both drafted in the teens and went to smaller colleges.  Both guys dont say much but let their defense do the talking.  Multiple defensive players of the year awards. Both feared on the court and field.    Dwight Howard - Cam Newton Both former number 1 draft picks due to their freakish athleticism. Both would become all stars and perform at elite levels leading to both being nicknamed Superman. Both reached the pinnacles of their respective sports whilst facing adversity. Both on track for great comeback seasons
Jameis Winston is Russell Westbrook
"That would almost be Russell Westbrook but then you said “who can shoot”. But still, occasionally Westbrook!"
1. LeBron James  2. Steph Curry  3. Kevin Durant  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Russell Westbrook  7. Chris Paul  8. Paul George  9. Klay Thompson  10. Dirk Nowitzki  Gotta include Dirk for carrying that 2011 championship run. I'd put DWade and Dwight Howard in the previous decade. Dwight's peak was relatively short.
"But  the video is exactly that unorthodox passing.  But I've never heard someone compare Russell westbrook to allen Iverson, so how could Pete be compared to those guys?"
"1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Chris Paul 5. James Harden 6. Kwahi Leonard 7. Russell Westbrook 8. Paul George 9. Klay Thompson 10. Kyrie Irving  2nd and 3rd can switch, 4th to 7th can switch.    I will have Curry over Durant because I feel like the 73 win Warriors was so iconic. I also feel like Kawhi didn't play enough game, but I can see people put it as high as 4th.   Other Options:   1. Draymond Green, Kyle Lowry, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard   Just need a few more space 2. Antony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Kemba Walker   They were losing games  3. Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall   They were winning games, they will be in the ""Hall of Very Good"" 4. Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Dewayne Wade, Kobe Bryant, Tony Parker, Steve Nash, Manu Ginobili, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams   They still had some great years, but they all fell off in the second half of the decade, like having troubles to make the playoffs 5.  Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid    They are only relevant in the second half of the decade"
"Woj: Raptors Rejected Russell Westbrook, Paul George for Pascal Siakam Trade  Guess woj is making up stories then?"
"Yeah, I've seen this comparison a lot in this thread. The only way Williams is like Maravich is his unorthodox passing. Pistol Pete was ten times the scorer that White Chocolate was. He was more Russell Westbrook or Allen Iverson than he is Jason Williams."
"I mean you toss a tiger in the deal, who knows what happens? Oh, it went rogue on Russell Westbrook? Deal saved, thank you Joe Exotic"
I kinda like this list. It's the top 10 in VORP for the playoffs from 2009-10 to 2018-19 combined.  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Draymond Green  7. Chris Paul  8. Dwyane Wade  9. Russell Westbrook  10. Al Horford  Now I'd take off Draymond and Horford and replace them with Lowry and Dame I think and then shuffle it a bit. Maybe something like.  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Chris Paul  7. Russell Westbrook  8. Dame Lillard  9. Dwyane Wade  10. Kyle Lowry
Russell Westbrook and James Harden with the Thunder in 2027
"KD himself liked it   &gt;Kevin Durant tells me it was a ""total accident"" that he liked a comment on Instagram about Russell Westbrook. Was just an honest mistake.  https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/988516403706609664  I totally believe him, 100%, never seen a more honest guy"
[I would say tell Kobe but that’d be in poor taste](https://lakersnation.com/kobe-bryant-says-russell-westbrook-reminds-him-most-of-himself/2016/08/26/)
"And Russell Westbrook was a huge anomaly.   Kobe was great that year, I'm not trying to take that away from him. But i do not believe him to have been particularly close to MVP."
"Russell Westbrook literally won MVP three years ago winning 47 games and being the 6th seed, dude. It was a goddamn miracle that he was the 7th seed with Smush Parker, Kwame Brown and Chris Mihm as starters. That was probably the biggest carry job in the last century, but it gets overlooked.  35.4/5.3/4.5/1.8/0.4 on 45/35/85 in a much slower pace with terrible spacing. That was insane."
"I'm pretty sure the MVP doesn't win most of the time.   2018-19 - Giannis Antetokounmpo, Raptors championship   2017-18 - James Harden, Warriors fake championship  2016-17 - Russell Westbrook, Warriors fake championship  2015-16 - Steph Curry (L), Cavaliers championship  2014-15 - Steph Curry , Warriors fake championship   Judging from my research, the MVP doesn't win most of the time."
"Russell Westbrook, Marcus Smart, Kevin Durant, Embiid. That's just big names that will get media coverage. Basically the entire NBA players have sent PSA tweets to spread awareness. The money right now will be needed to clean up stuff. Just wait until it's over and families that are without jobs and over things like that then is when the money will be needed. Then even more players will donate. Plus I am sure the NBA will dump off a good chunk of money to help, and that money may be coming from players salaries."
I don’t see the point in people talking shit about nipsey. Even if you didn’t like his music you should be able to appreciate the stuff Nipsey did for the LA community (where Russell Westbrook is from). 🏁
"From 2008-2011, you guys passed up on some amazing players. The 3 players, from 2008-2010, that was picked DIRECTLY after your picks were Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, &amp; Demarcus Cousins."
"Kobe dies: ""A huge reminder to appreciate greatness while they're still around, regardless of who they play for!""  2 months later: ""Fuck Russell Westbrook."""
"Lebron. I've rooted against his teams forever but I didn't hate him in Miami or even after 2016. Just after he went to the Lakers. Obviously a hell of a player but it seems like his attention seeking tendencies ramped up a notch after he joined the Lakers, which granted isn't all his fault. Lakers always get a ton of attention  On the flip side, Russell Westbrook is someone I used to hate since college but not so much anymore. I respect how hard he plays every game"
you don’t think russell westbrook is better than klay thompson?
"Who says that I’m talking about 1 specific game? We’re talking about the body of work each player through out the season and that includes the regular season. Lebron isn’t better than Westbrook due to narrative or due to reputation he’s better than Westbrook because he legitimately plays at a higher level. Both the footage and data reflect this. Same goes for most of the guys I mentioned   Like I said it’s not based on reputation, all those guys were better players in 2017. Russell Westbrook had the narrative so he ended up winning. You really trying to argue that Westbrook was better than the likes of Lebron or KD in 2017?  Jazz were a pretty strong defensive team but to imply that it we could completely attribute that to Rudy Gobert isn’t very accurate. They have strong defenders at every position and one of the best coaches in the game. Another thing about defensive rating is that it can be buffed due to continuously playing average to below average teams on a nightly basis, the 2018 raptors for example were a number 7 defense but they got lit up by some of the top offensive teams in the regular season(and playoffs) and the same thing happened in 2017. So it may be that Gobert can excel playing against average playoff teams but once they match up against top offenses he ceases to have significant defensive impact on the level of a guy like Draymond.   For example vs the rockets in the regular season of 2018 the jazz were only 6 points better vs Houston with Gobert  in 2019 the jazz were actually better without Gobert on the by about 3 points  in 2017 the jazz were 10 points better without Gobert on the floor  in 2020 the jazz were 20 points better without Gobert on the floor  Vs the warriors   2019: The jazz were only 1.7 points better with Gobert  2018: the jazz were an impressive 16 points better with Gobert(probably due to the warriors coasting honestly)   2017: the Jazz were 11.6 better without Gobert on the floor  Vs the Cavs  2017: jazz were 8 points better without Gobert on the floor  2018: he didn’t play vs the cavs  Vs the nuggets:  2017: jazz were only 1.7 points better with Gobert   2018: jazz were 6 points better without Gobert on the floor   2019: jazz were 6 points worse without Gobert   2020: jazz are 2 points better without Gobert   Is this the kind of impact you expect from a DPOY guy?  Let’s compare to Draymond   Cavs  2016: warriors were 24 points worse without Draymond   2017: warriors were 23 points worse on defense without Draymond   2018: warriors were 12.7 points worse without Draymond   Rockets  2017: warriors were 13 points worse without Draymond   2018: warriors were 20.6 points worse without Draymond   2019: warriors were only 0.7 points  worse on defense without Draymond.   2020: warriors are 23.9 points worse without Draymond   Vs nuggets:   2017: warriors were only 0.7 points better with Draymond   2018: warriors were 9.6 points better with Draymond   2019: warriors were 19.4 points better with Draymond   2020: warriors were 1.8 points worse without Draymond   There is even more evidence vs teams like Toronto or Portland that Rudy simply isn’t very impactful on defense vs the likes of Draymond. Obviously these aren’t huge sample sizes but the numbers here seem to be pretty consistent. Draymond is on a whole other level defensively vs even the greatest offense teams. I don’t think defensive stats are all that great to begin especially individual defensive stats but usually this type of consistency across can at least give us some idea of what’s going in.  Who said they were comparable rim protectors?  Draymond is definitely more impactful especially vs the top teams, it’s hard for me to say that a guy who’s teams are better without him on defense for a good chunk of time(vs the top offenses) can be called the DPOY  Ok but the original post legitimately tried to use the DPOY award as an argument that draymond isn’t as good defensively as the other guys. That’s what I was responding to."
LOL your website has Barkley and Garnett in the top 10 and fucking Jason Kidd and Russell Westbrook in the top 20. The whole TPA bullshit totally favors stat padding which is why Westbrook has the second highest TPA season of all time. LOL at “Here is a real article.”   Instead of saying “I’m not reading cause it said xyz” why don’t u refute the points you disagree with and we can discuss them.
"Who was the better athlete in his prime, Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook? Both were inhumanly fast and explosive. Does Russ get an edge because of his strength?"
"Because historically, it just doesn’t matter if you’re good enough on offense. Steve Nash, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, and Isaiah Thomas are/were varying degrees of mediocre to bad on the defensive end, and that doesn’t/didn’t stop them from being better than defensive studs like Jrue Holiday and Mike Conley (in his prime anyway). I’m not saying that Fox will touch their heights on the offensive end, but I think Lonzo is quite limited on what he can do effectively on the offensive end. And while his defense is very solid and borders on all-defense level when he plays for a solid defensive team, it’s not all-time-great enough to get over his terrible free throw shooting and inability to create his own shot consistently."
"Draymond Green can do everything at an elite level, no defender in nba history has displayed this kind of versatility on defense. Now back in the day guys weren’t really asked to defend on the perimeter so we can’t say they couldn’t do it but at this stage we can only evaluate what we have seen.   Also awards don’t mean jack, Kawhi doesn’t have any MVPs while Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo do. In no universe are those guys better players, they get the MVP because it’s a narrative based award.  The same goes for DPOY, does it really make sense for Rudy Gobert to have two DPOY awards when we know there are better defenders in the league? Is a guy who can’t stay on the floor vs small ball line ups with lots of shooting(Rockets/warriors) really the DPOY? No this to is a narrative based award.    This would be like arguing that Kobe was better than Lebron because he has more rings"

"Bro I’m 35+. Lmao @ you trying ‘you didn’t watch him play’ on me.   So let’s step this conversation up a level. Not only did I watch it and see it, but from a hooper’s mind I know *why* he used certain moves. And believe me, a hook shot was never, EVER, part of Kobe’s regular must have go-to arsenal. Ever.   He used it to stunt. For fun. Or on very tough shots. Bc he’s that good (don’t get it twisted, he was a bad man!). But it’s not a shot you point to and say oh damn we gotta stop Kobe’s hook shot! If Kobe shot a hook you’d say ‘whew! Great’ . It’s not a good shot! Lol   Put it this way: what’s more impressive, shooting your way out of a foxhole, Or being precise and tactical enough to never have to get *into* a foxhole?!? Kobe fans consistently fall for the former. Mike was the latter. So he doesnt have many of those wild contested shots. (Very Young mike did, at the rim). Look at the space he creates vs Russell, vs Ehlo, etc.   But Kobe fans fall for the glamour and appeal of the bad shot over outstretched hands. Kobe trick y’all *Westbrook voice*"

&gt; profiles close to Russell Westbrook  Because that’s a take worthy of ridicule. Marbury was never close to Westbrook as a player.
Got ridiculed on here for saying he profiles close to Russell Westbrook. Was nasty in a defensive era for inept teams throughout his career.
"James Harden, LeBron, Russell Westbrook"
"for charlotte, i googled a random one and found this: kemba walker / dell curry / glen rice / larry johnson / alonzo mourning  for UCLA: russell westbrook / reggie miller / jamaal wilkes / bill walton / kareem  yeah"
"let's go back and apply efficiency to everything i said  i said russell westbrook as the #1 option did not have team success. that's not all, though, he was also inefficient. his 55.4% TS% in 2017 was right at league avg.  in the past three seasons since leaving the cavs, kyrie has maintained a 59.9% TS%.  as the second option? kyrie's TS% was 57.3% in cleveland. and that's with him being 22 to 24-years-old.  while in the past two years as the second-option to paul george as a 29-year-old and 30-year-old, westbrook has maintained a TS% of 48.2%.  even lower than kyrie's awful TS% in the postseason last year as the first-option of 48.8%."

"Not sure about averaging 40 but a good analogy for the type of player Jordan would be in this era would be to imagine a player with Harden's offensive capability, couple that with Kawhi's defense, add the athleticism of Russell Westbrook and then for good measure give him the Mamba mentality. That's Jordan."
"If you can trade Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook on those contracts, you can trade John Wall.  All they really need is a team with some cap space that can use a star point guard.  Lots of teams who may be treading water in the standings could take a couple of years on a bad deal, tank, and then get a few draft picks.  OKC wasn't expected to do well at all, their plan was to amass picks and maybe have the fans come out to see Chris Paul for a bit.  They lucked out and became good, but they still have a star and they still have picks.    The Bulls, Knicks, Piston, and Cavs are all lower tier teams without a good point guard, whichever one of them that has cap space can afford to take Wall and tank for a bit.  They really have nothing to lose.  Win and they get some fans and maybe start building something.  Lose and they get picks."
"yeah. i considered that. the west has been considered the harder conference for god knows how long. with that being said, cp3 is considered by many to be a top 5 pg in history. i can say that, taking that into account, that i feel like when you're considered an all time great (in real time) that you have success being said all time great.  2013- up 2-0 on memphis and lose 4-2 1st round  2015- blew a 3-1 lead to houston in 2nd round  2016- up 2-0 vs portland and lose 4-2 1st round  i won't say he didn't show up in all of those games because i'm not much of a stat nerd nor do i remember the full context of the games, but i know for a fact that there were definitely series where you did say ""how the hell did y'all blow that game/series lead?"". i mean, look at dirk. they said the same about him for a long ass time, but even he got a ring 2011 as the best player on that team.  and to be fair, i thought d rose was more like russell westbrook pre russell westbrook and didn't think his scoring necessarily lead to team success despite winning 60+ games his mvp season. but in his 1 mvp season, his success was accompanied by team success... until they got whipped by the heatles XD"
Could Peja be the point man defending Russell Westbrook? Doubt it.
Lmfaoo he was torching Russell Westbrook and Dame Lillard with a “fucked knee” but couldn’t iso Kevin Love on the biggest possession of his life.
"Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook."
"Trae does not deserve All-NBA. For  Guards who you have Trae over?: Russell Westbrook, Ben Simmons, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Lebron, Doncic, Kemba, Mitchell???   His biggest thing is that he’s got good stats, but those stats haven’t won him games whereas most of these players are leading to winning teams."
"It was a weird vibe because the Away crowd probably went from  ""Ok we got this, we're dominating but I also want to tell my grand kids I was there when Russell Westbrook made history""  to   ""Haha, you know our playoff hopes are at stake here. There's no way we're losing this, right? Right??""  to   ""OH. MY. GOD."""
"Not only that, he had to face:  * Portland: LaMarcus Aldridge &amp; Brandon Roy * 2x Defending Champion Los Angeles: Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom &amp; Andrew Bynum * OKC: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden"
Do you have anything to back up your stupid claim or are you just talking out of your ass? Stockton averaged more assists at home than on the road but there's nothing to imply home cooking.          Here are some players who averaged over 8.0 career assists per game and how they compared in home games vs road games where data is available via basketball reference.           |Player|Assists Home|Assists Road|% Increase| :--|--:|--:|--:|     |Steve Nash|8.3|8.7|-4.6%|     |Russell Westbrook|8.6|8.0|7.5%| |John Stockton|10.9|10.1|7.9%| |Chris Paul|9.8|9.0|8.8%|.  |Ben Simmons|8.4|7.6|10.5%|.    |Rajon Rondo|8.7|7.8|11.5%| |Jason Kidd|9.2|8.2|12.2%|
"I'm to this way late but their offense statistically was better off his rebounds:  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  &gt;Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  &gt;That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  &gt;After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years.  I'd also note they did the exact same thing with KD (in 2016 his uncontested rebounds were similar to Russ, then he left and more just went to Russ).  The thinking is that Adams can rim run the other way and Russ just passes it to someone else in a sprint to the rim I think."
"&gt;I'll have to look, but I think he was I'm the MVP conversation  2016 MVP Voting:  1. Steph Curry 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. LeBron James 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Kevin Durant 6. Chris Paul 7.

With KD having 119 out of 125 votes, and LeBron the other 6?"
"Yeah Jordan retired and they went from a 57 win team to a 55 win team.   Pippen (a superstar) and Grant (an allstar) were able to crack 50 wins... that says a lot about how great those players were.  There are “superstars” in this league like Paul George and Russell Westbrook that couldn’t win 50 together.   The next year Grant went to Orlando and Pippen could only keep the Bulls barely above .500 by himself.  To be fair, though, Michael Jordan had a losing season his first 3 seasons before the arrival of Pippen and Grant.    Jordan re-joined the team but they failed to make noise in the playoffs until they found a replacement for Grant (Rodman)."
"Russell Westbrook does it and is still considered an elite player. At his best top 5 in the league, at least in his MVP season. MJ is bigger, more crafty, a better finisher with either hand and also just has a higher B-ball IQ than Westbrook. So teleporting 88 MJ into 2020 would still wreck this league to pieces even without a three ball."
"AD was on the call  &gt;Chris Paul, the president of the players association, arranged the call that included LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook, sources said.  https://ca.news.yahoo.com/sources-nba-superstars-establish-united-front-on-private-conference-call-to-resume-season-210518262.html"
"&gt;  I don’t think any of the current stars have his determination and drive when it comes to winning.  Kobe was probably the last one that everyone felt had it. To me, Damian Lillard, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, and Russell Westbrook are a few that have it.   &gt; Even when he bullies his teammates he still looks cool doing it.  Nah his teamates and co-workers were just scared. That's all."

"MJ would still average 30+ for multiple seasons, what would actually go up would be his assists and rebs. As we see more guards getting more rebs in this era and the spacing and pace leads to more assists. Young Jordan would basically be a bigger Russell Westbrook with better decision-making.   The difference is Jordan was actually playing elite level defense for most of his prime, imagine if he decided to give half effort on defense like Westbrook, Harden and Durant have done for most of their careers."
"And I think he would be at least average at it. But sometimes it seems like they just assume he would be elite at it.  Its hard to really make assumptions about what other greats would do in different eras. I think most would still be great, but its too easy to just be like ""MJ would be a taller Russell Westbrook with Klay's 3pt shot(cuz he is just so competitive, so he'd naturally be one of the best). So he'd average 45 a game."""
"# Some coaches may die but that's a risk we're willing to take -   ^(LeBron James, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry probably)"
https://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1  You’ll find Giannis on that list just below Devonte Graham and CJ McCollum. Drives about half as often as league leader Russell Westbrook.  Is the Blazers offence coming from CJ McCollum drives?
"There is an undeniable top 7 of all time, and that is *some order* of MJ, LeBron, Kareem, Magic, Bird, Bill Russell, and Wilt. Most orderings of these players make sense and arguments exist to place them in most spots from 1-7 (I say most - nobody is really arguing that MJ is lower than #2, for example). These players are recognized as the greatest at their respective positions - Magic the best PG, MJ the best SG, Kareem the best C, etc. Each of these players were recognized at one time, in terms of both accolades and popular basketball culture, as being the most dominant in the league at one time, or locked against one of the other 7 for unquestioned dominance. It is constituted by players who represented not only transcendent talent that translated into winning, but also imprints on basketball culture for eternity.  There is a tier after that with *some order* of Kobe, Tim Duncan, Hakeem, Shaq, Moses Malone, Jerry West, and Oscar Robertson. By the end of his career Steph will probably be in this 2nd tier. One could make an argument that Kobe, Shaq, Hakeem, and Tim Duncan maybe deserve placement in the 1st tier - Kobe's dominance and cultural impact, Hakeem's contributions to the Center position that persist to this day, Tim Duncan being the  greatest PF of all time - but the point of the 1st tier is that they are undeniably THE top. It's tough to make an argument putting any of those in the 2nd tier ahead of anyone in the 1st tier.  Similarly, coincidentally, there is also an undeniable top 7 in the current NBA, of *some order* of LeBron, KD, Steph, Giannis, Harden, AD, and Kawhi.* Arguments exist year-to-year or even month-to-month that any of these players are the single best in the NBA at a moment. These players have won and could within all good reason win again MVP or FMVP in any given year. They exhibit the offensive talent to drop 40+ on any night and carry the vast bulk of their team's offensive load over the course of a season or playoff series. You could reasonably build an entire team around any one of these players and, with some other all-star talent, have a contender. At least 2 of these players have been all-NBA 1st team every year since 2009, and it feels like a given that LeBron and Giannis will be 1st team for this year whether the season is finished or not.  There is a tier after that with *some order* of Paul George, Jokic, Embiid, Westbrook, Chris Paul, Dame, and, as weird as it is to think about it, Luka Doncic. These are players who have a shot at being recognized as top 10 from a prominent publication, all-NBA 1st team, not-winning-but-maybe-2nd-or-3rd MVP candidates in any given year. There are arguments for other players, including Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Pascal, Gobert, and Ben Simmons, to be in this tier. Most of this tier is younger players who stand to rise to further prominence in the league within the next 5 years.   *I guess nobody's really gonna argue AD is #1 in any given year so far of his career but nobody's gonna argue Magic is #1 of all time and he still belongs in that highest pantheon."
Christopher Paul  Michael Conley Jr.  Zachary Randolph  Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook would be the guy with his mic unmuted with children yelling in the background
"Durant had his best individual season in 2013-14 when Westbrook missed nearly half the season, with Durant taking over as both the primary ballhandler and playmaker.  He ended up putting up 32 ppg on .635 TS and winning MVP.  Furthermore, if we look at the biggest chunk of time that Russell missed (from 12/27 to 2/13, KD upped his production to a superhuman 35 ppg on .652 TS."
"ESPN: NBA superstars LeBron James, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry held private conference call on Monday and established united front in favor of Giannis Antetokounmpo joining their respective teams"

Why is Russell Westbrook here?  He wasn't voted in the All-Realm team.
Dwight Powell is a Stanford graduate &amp; held scholarship offers from Harvard &amp; Georgia Tech.  If anything he’s the Michael Jordan of this group.  Edit: Lowry studied at Villanova (#1 law school)  Chris Paul at Wake Forest (#1 in Counseling) Tatum at Duke (#10 national university ranking) Russell Westbrook at UCLA &amp; had offer from Creighton whose academics are highly touted top 10 in a lot of categories
"**SUPERSTAR:**  1.) LeBron James  2.) Giannis Antetokounmpo   3.) Kevin Durant  4.) Steph Curry  5.) Kawhi Leonard  6.) James Harden  7.) Damian Lillard  8.) Russell Westbrook  9.) Nikola Jokic  10.) Luka Doncic  These 10 players change the game at a high dynamic and can have success without the help of a second all star if need to be. These players are true gamechangers.  **STAR:**  11.) Anthony Davis  12.) Kyrie Irving  13.) Paul George  14.) Joel Embiid  15.) Chris Paul  16.) Jimmy Butler  17.)  Kemba Walker  18.) Bradley Beal  19.) Kyle Lowry  20.) Ben Simmons   Players that are very, very good. However, you can’t exactly build a team around a “Star” player without complimenting with other stars if you want to have success.  (Simmons without Embiid can’t make it very far)  (Embiid without Simmons can’t make it very far)  (Davis couldn’t get far without second star/(Was dominant with Boogie)  (Kyrie couldn’t make playoffs or win games without LeBron)  (Paul George in his current state can’t carry a team very far due to his inability to shoot consistently)  (CP3 needs Blake/Harden.)  (Butler needs Embiid/Simmons)  (Kemba couldn’t go very far without a second star/needs Tatum to become a star)  (Beal needs Wall)  (Lowry needs DeRozan or Kawhi)"
&gt;I.e. Russell westbrook at 42 all time??  How is he not? He was ranked 44 all time in the last list and then he won an mvp and averaged 3 straight triple doubles. If anything he should be higher than at-least Giannis who's career achievements are way less than Russ' at this point.
"&gt;Chris Paul and players Russell Westbrook, Jayson Tatum, Kyle Lowry, Dwight Powell.  One of these is not like others."
"Ehh every year these lists are BS, full of individual bias and lack any real analysis on where players should land. It's also full of recency bias.  I.e. Russell westbrook at 42 all time??  Plus Hakeem or Tim duncan not in the top 10 is an absolute travesty.  Looks like their top 10 will be MJ, Kareem, magic, bird, shaq, LeBron, Kobe, wilt, Bill Russell. Pretty predictable. I would probably put Duncan over Kobe."
"Great players win MVPs sure, but great players also don't win MVPs. Great players also do not always win MVP and instead win FMVPs (see Dwyane Wade, Chauncey Billups, Kawhi Leonard).   I agree that Russell Westbrook and Oscar Robertson are better than Cedric Maxwell and Andre Iguadala, there's no argument there, but you are continually using the weakest example of a FMVP, ones that were hotly debated too. Most folks agree that Bird and Steph should have won those FMVPs. Regardless in a vaccum if you told someone you can have a FMVP on your team or a guy that averages a triple double, I think most take the FMVP. You've got like a 1/30 chance of it being an Iguadala/Maxwell type and instead a 1/2 chance that it's a MJ/Kobe/Shaq/Hakeem/Duncan etc type.   I think this is all entirely subjective and depends on the player. With the increase in pace, you could have a player like Draymond Green or Fat Lever or Darrell Walker who averages a 10/10/10 triple double (all three of these guys averaged 10-14 ppg, 9 rpg and 8-9 apg near triple doubles. All it takes is one guy to average a low triple double and the whole argument becomes for not. Because now you are having to argue Oscar, Russell and a 10/10/10 guy."
"Yeah, but Bird and Magic are Bird and Magic.  Different categories.  If Lebron and Steph want to play on the 2024 Olympic team, they're playing.  If Russell Westbrook wants to be there, he'll need to buy a ticket like everyone else.  Being an all time great has some perks."
This is a hypothetical situation where I found what on average did a slashing/mid range shooting Player that was put in a situation surrounded by 3 point shooters Russell Westbrook Derrick Rose and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Got the average percentage increase from the field which was 4.5% then used per 36 stats for the 87 and 89 season except the freethrows which I maintained. Added the 4.5% field goal increase and Multiplied the shot attempts by that number. Then I assumed all of Jordan shots were from two added the free throws and averaged it out. For the assists there was a certain percentage they all went up the average percentage was like 24.88 The lowest of which was was Giannis. Multiplied the per 36 assists by 1.2488 and rounded up. And maintained per 36 rebounds because I couldn’t find a formula as players had drastic differences in regard to that.
Other players:  Shaquille O'Neal - 546  Dirk Nowitzki - 759  Vince Carter - 768  Dwyane Wade - 768  Blake Griffin - 511  Tony Parker - 1023   James Harden - 891  Russell Westbrook - 977  Kevin Durant - 551  Giannis Antetokounmpo - 475  Manu Ginobili - 538  Derrick Rose - 697
I literally googled slashers in the NBA to make sure I wasn’t being biased. I had no idea what the numbers would have been for the improvement of Giannis Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook when surrounded by shooters my methodology is all in that post.I was initially just going to use Westbrook but wanted to have a bigger sample size to have a better baseline.
I adjusted Jordan stats per 36 except for the free throws I maintain that as his regular season numbers as Harden shoots a comparable amount and is less physical. I then average the improvement slashers have compared to their career averages when put in a system and surrounded by shooters Giannis 5.3 Derrick Rose 3.6 Russell Westbrook 4.5 I rounded up to 4.5. Then I use the per 36 shot attempts which in the 87 season was 25 add the 4.5% increase to Jordan’s 48.2%. Which is 52.7 then multiply 52.7%* 25 which is 13.18 i’ve been state I assume all shot are two pointers given his tendencies which would translate to 26.36 add the 10.2 FTM per game and that is 36.6 rounded up.
"If you were to read further down in my paragraph you would see I accounted for that by using per 36 minutes those seasons and not the raw numbers. Hi Benit try to account for spacing by using Derrick Rose, Giannis, and Russell Westbrook as baseline to see How much Slasher/mid range shooter Field goal percentage increases after being surrounded by shooters. And I still got less stats for be adjusted 87 and 89 years. Jordan was 25 in 89 and was then put in a system that suppressed individual stats. I then did a second stat line I didn’t think would be controversial with a scenario where he improves like harden did improved under D’Antoni."
"Assuming that he improves his field goal percentage by the average amount Giannis, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook did after being surrounded by shooters (+4.5%) it would actually be less efficient for Michael Jordan to shoot a league average percentage from 3 on a league average attempts."
Imagine putting someone like Bob Pettit over Chris Paul. This entire list has blown my mind. Bob Cousy over Russell Westbrook? What are we smoking fellas.
"6th man winners, last 10  * Lou Williams * Eric Gordon * Jamal Crawford * JR Smith * James Harden * Lamar Odom * Jason Terry * Manu Ginobili * Leandro Barbosa * Mike Miller  Assist leader, last 10  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * Rajon Rondo * Chris Paul * Steve Nash * Jason Kidd * Andre Miller * Rod Strickland * Mark Jackson * John Stockton   3 MVPs in the assist squad. 1 in the 6man squad."
Russell Westbrook is overrated. He's a good stats/bad team type of guy. He's a ball hog stat chaser. People see his passion and ferocity but I see it as selfishness and losing basketball. He's had a few MVP caliber teammates who have moved on and had way more success without him.
"KD comes after (no order);   Jordan, Kareem, Russell, Wilt, LeBron, Shaq, Duncan, Bird, Magic, Olajuwon, Bryant, Big O, West, Erving, Moses. These are locks. 15 already.   Nowitzki, Garnett, Curry have stronger cases than Durant. Robinson struggled just as much as KD in the playoffs and did better than KD in regular seasons, So, Robinson is also has a stronger case than Durant. So, KD is barely top 20.   Barkley, Wade and Malone have similar cases to Durant in terms of quality. KD is yet to match Malone's longevity though. So, we are looking at 21 at best right now.      I'll tell you this, from what I understand from your list, you do not know how good those players were and you try to decide with their career resumes and reputation. Iverson wasn't a top 50 player ever. Westbrook wasn't better than Ewing. If Pippen was better/greater than Ewing, then how the hell the Bulls struggled against the Knicks? They had the best player in MJ, they had the 2nd player in Pippen (!), they had the better depth in their roster. Zeke was certainly not better than Nash, Hayes, Wade, Barkley, Pettit. Ray Allen wasn't in the same league as Reed who was able to go toe to toe with Russell and Chamberlain.      Your list has major issues and the reason of those issues is you're going by resume and reputations."
I remember Jeremy Lin saying only Russell Westbrook was faster pre draft and he was labeled deceptively fast
"The fact that you listed fucking Paul Millsap or Gobert as having an argument over MVP 8x All Star Russell Westbrook who went to the finals shows your obviously just an ignorant hater whose opinion is worth nothing   Also, Giannis AD and Lillard are ***inarguably*** not over Westbrook for the decade"
"The real difference is the Raptors have played the Bucks in the postseason a lot less than the Warriors have played the Rockets.  I can't argue that Warriors fans don't have something against Harden/the Rockets. It's partly because the sheer amount of times our teams have played each other. It's also partly due to the Rockets being billed as ""the Warriors killer"" by the media as well as the Rockets organization itself. Imagine if an entire organization was hell-bent on just beating your team, that might foster some hatred. For me though, it's more about Harden. He's sort of the nega-Steph, getting so many free throws and having so much time on-ball. I'd also argue the hate got worse when KD joined the warriors. Our team became the ""villain"" of the NBA, so we had to find our own villain. We chose the team that would be our Lex Luthor- the team ""made for the warriors"" who's greatest goal was beating our team.   Comparing that to the Raptors and the Bucks, there is a large difference. The history is not nearly as deep, nor as mired in controversy.  Comparing that to the beef between the Warriors and the Rockets is like apples and oranges.  I personally don't have anything against the Rockets as a team. I like Russell Westbrook, Daniel House, Thabo Sefolosha, Ben McLemore and Robert Covington. I just really don't like James Harden, Austin Rivers or Mike D'Antoni.   The Warriors also have many more fans than the Raptors, which means that there are much more people posting with a warriors flair. The Warriors fanbase ranks fourth in fan equity, whereas the Raptors are fourteenth. That is not to say the Raptors are a bad fanbase, I'd say they're good and loyal, there's just a size difference between the two markets. The stupid/salty post-per-capita might be the same, there's just a larger sample size on the Warriors sub. In the end, there's no real way to measure such things (that I've found).  Also, yes, your comment was hypocritical. You're a Raptors fan who is calling Warriors fans sore winners. You are hating on the team that your team beat, making you a sore winner. That's hypocrisy."
Isn't Lin 6'3? That is excellent size for a PG. He isnt Russell Westbrook but he had great athleticism and showed it in the combine if I'm not mistaken.
"I agree with most of this, I just feel like it's worth mentioning that this wasn't a team planning to build around Russell until summer of 2016. It was meant to be an athletic, defense oriented team with 2 great isolation players, and then the far better of the two iso players walked out in free agency. It was a model that had worked well in the past, and had relatively high level success with the Thunder ie taking a 3-1 lead vs the warriors. This team should have been completely broken and disfunctional once Durant left, and instead Westbrook lifted the team to the 6th seed. I think that's why we loved Westbrook's season so much, if I can speak for thunder fans as a group."
"Don’t forget Russell Westbrook, he’s nearly impossible to guard one on one"
How the hell do you rate Bob Pettit above Russell Westbrook?      Russ would humiliate and abuse Pettit to the point where slavery would be reinstated.
"&gt; But Horford picked a four-year, $113 million deal with the Celtics over the Thunder, reportedly wanting assurances he couldn't get from Durant and Russell Westbrook that they'd be around long term. Thunder general manager Sam Presticonfirmed Horford was ""really, really interested"" in the Thunder. ""... but obviously the timing of Kevin's situation and his just didn't link up,"" Presti said at his press conference Monday. ""And that's part of free agency. That's how it goes  https://oklahoman.com/article/5508075/okc-thunder-journal-how-close-was-al-horford-to-joining-okc"
"Steve Nash is for sure, a top 5 or top 10 point guard, but a lot of people don’t think about the era certain MVPs played in. It was probably a good PR move to award an agreeable, consistent and team-player like Nash. The mid-00s were a ballhog-led, antagonistic, disloyal, and effort-selective era in the NBA. That whole rumor mill about the best players only trying in the playoffs was mostly true.  But I also got to watch Steve Nash play during this MVP era, against a young and brutal Chicago Bulls, and despite the Suns having a pretty off-night, Nash was wiping the floor with them. I remember him grabbing rebounds left &amp; right(something he wasn’t really known for.)  In the NBA some players’ legends precede them; even if you’ve never payed much attention to Lebron James, you know he’s arguably the best basketball player in the world.  Then there’s guys like Steve Nash, Russell Westbrook or David Robinson, who weren’t the most famous names or even the ones topping the points column. But if you watched these guys during their MVP seasons, you knew they deserved the award."
It’s the argument of best player in basketball completely carrying his lottery level supporting cast vs player who elevated his good supporting cast and had the team success. The only time I’ve seen best individual season with lower team success win mvp was Russell Westbrook and that took averaging a triple double.
"You just said Klay is better than Russell Westbrook man. Let’s just agree to disagree, have a nice day and stay safe."
"There's not any guys close to him talent wise (he's the goat after all), but guys like CP3, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, among others that have the work hard, high intensity mindset have been on the trade market the last few years.  And then his draft picks just don't fit that bill. His four high draft picks were Kwame Brown, Adam Morrison, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Cody Zeller too, which were all terrible as well, and guys like Morrison and Brown are like anti-Jordans."
"Again, that's not relevant to my point. Russell Westbrook in 2016 is a replaceable player. He was a low iq, inefficient scorer who could pass and rebound. Dude was averaging 40% from the field in the post season. He only had 2 games above 40% vs the Warriors in that series.   My point is that the team KD had in OKC is NOWHERE NEAR the team he joined in GS. Fax. You're not about to sit here and tell me in 2016 Russell Westbrook is anywhere close to as valuable of a player as Curry or Klay. KD had bad performances as well, but I wonder why that is? Could it possibly be because he had to take the entire offensive load because Russell Westbrook is the king of putting up stats during garbage time, and doing it super inefficiently? Curry played bad in the 3 games OKC won. games 1, 3 and 4. OKC weren't winning because they were just as good as GS. They were winning because GS was slacking. As soon as they went back to playing like GS, OKC didn't stand a chance. They were able to contain Klay and make him play badly and were still losing games. You're smoking if you think that OKC team was anywhere near as good as the team KD joined. And they knocked the Spurs off because Kawhi played like shit. Dude had games where he couldn't hit free throws, couldn't hit a 3, shooting like 35ish percent from the field. And it STILL went to 6 games."
"For some context,   In almost the entirety of their prime in OKC, Russell Westbrook was putting up stronger impact than Durant in the playoffs.  KD had prettier numbers but RW was able to collapse the defense and create something in the playoffs constantly.   I am shocked Kobe thought RW was better than Durant. Brilliant."
I’ll never forget when Ricky Rubio master baited all over Russell Westbrook in the playoffs.
I always agreed with the argument that best player in a fringe playoff team doesn’t deserve an mvp - but then Russell Westbrook won it and now I’m extra salty about Kobe not winning another mvp title.
"who do you think will end up higher on the all time list, luka or russell westbrook? you think thats an obvious choice too because russ has the accomplishment while luka has the potential?"
Russell Westbrook...
"Russell Westbrook is the result of an uncle that gave tons of high fives but always told Russell he was too slow for the down low five.  ""Too slow"" is a phrase he repeats to himself during workouts, which allowed him to push himself in to perfect basketball shape."
"80’s: Ralph Sampson, Charles Oakley, Dominique Wilkins, Vinnie Johnson, Magic Johnson  90’s: Hakeem Olajuwon, Shawn Kemp/ Larry Johnson/ Charles Barkley, Grant Hill, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton  00’s: Shaq, Chris Webber, Tracy Mcgrady, Allen Iverson, Gilbert Arenas   10’s: Demarcus Cousins, Kenneth Faried, LeBron James, Corey Brewer, Russell Westbrook   20’s: DeAndre Ayton, Brandon Clarke, Jayson Tatum, Donte Divincenzo, Lonzo Ball"
"Well he did just that in their first run, he played primarily on-ball, facilitating for the team and he was a monster.   The two players that assisted him the most were andrew bogut and Draymond Green, neither of which is in the same league as CP3 or Russell Westbrook, but it was not as good as his 2016 year that stands as the best scoring performance in history, nobody has scored as efficiently while using that much volume.  It is a philosophy question, what do you value more, someone who raises the floor performance of a team or someone who raises the ceiling. I would argue you need to get the peak team performance in team sports, so making good players better is a lot more valuable than making mediocre players better."
This article was just a preview of the type of analysis we’d see from OKC Thunder fans about Russell Westbrook over the next 3 years.
"D Wade was tougher. His body took a a battering year after year. Not just one year.   LeBron was tougher in a sense that he put that much mileage on his body gear after year with deep finals runs and carrying hapless teams. Coupled with his intense off season regimen.   Kobe. Well, need that be explained.   Russell Westbrook came back 6 weeks after a meniscus tear and was just regular Westbrook. He played the game after fracturing his face and just chucked a mask on and then went and smashed the Sixers.   Rajon Rondo finished a game off with a torn ACL and still balled pretty hard.   Derrick Rose tote his ACL 67,000 time’s and came back on all of them although not prime D Rose. His will to overcome THAT MUCH adversity trumps the one major bit of adversity pierce had. And that’s not to discredit the willpower of Pierce for coming back after being stabbed outside a club that many times because that’s not good. But Rose’s come back and persistence ha been mind blowing."
"My man, there is literally *no* argument for any of those guys being worse than Russ this season.  None of them have *anywhere* near as many flaws as Russ.  &gt;you can try, but you fail miserably.  Let me try. I promise I won't fail lmao. It's really really easy. [Here's how they stack up](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Damian+Lillard&amp;player_id1_select=Damian+Lillard&amp;player_id1=lillada01&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id2_hint=Nikola+Joki%C4%87&amp;player_id2_select=Nikola+Joki%C4%87&amp;player_id2=jokicni01&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id3_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id3_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id3=westbru01&amp;y3=2020&amp;player_id4_hint=Luka+Don%C4%8Di%C4%87&amp;player_id4_select=Luka+Don%C4%8Di%C4%87&amp;player_id4=doncilu01&amp;y4=2020)  Here's Russ' rank among the 4 of them (Lillard, Doncic, Jokic, and Russ) for various stats. For the record, you could also argue that guys like PG are better than Russ - he certainly was the best player on the Thunder last year.  Points: 3rd  TS%: 4th  Assists: 3rd (but he's 4th if we got per possession)  TOs: 4th  AST/TO ratio: 4th  Rebounds: 3rd   The advanced stats are laughable too. He's at like 1/3 of the other guys   BPM: 4th  WS/48: 4th  Wow, how could *anyone* ever make an argument he's not top 10. It's beyond me.   Russ is dead last by a mile in most of these stats. And again, there's other guys like PG that are better than him too. And lets not forget the other 3 can actually hit a jump shot lol"
"&gt; He's not even a top 10 player anymore, he's on the downswing, and again, he's making the 3rd most money.  You can't name 10 players in this league better than Russell Westbrook, you can try, but you fail miserably. due to the fact guys that are fringe Top 10 like Jokic, Dame and Luka have just as many flaws as him and are being put into a 1st option position, which they haven't show they are qualified for, while Russ is playing great behind Harden.  Top 7 of KD, Kawhi, LeBron, Giannis, Steph, AD and Harden is pretty clearcut, the three that are left are interchangeable and Russ 100% fits in any of those positions."
"I think Thibs is the Russell Westbrook of NBA coaches. He's got a lot of loud haters but his fans are loyal to him. He might be stuck in 2010 ways of basketball but he's incredibly fair (early Jimmy Butler years; management wanted Snell to start to lower Jimmy's demands cause he was expiring), he's bonding with hard workers and he is not afraid to hold stars accountable. Players notice that.  His Wolves were the 4th seed before Jimmy got hurt.  The Knicks tried to build through FA while being a 15 win team. That was obviously not going to work. If the make the playoffs while being a top 5 defense then they are an ideal fit for scoring superstars.  I think, given their player development system these past few years, that the Gobert Thibs way is a more likely way to succeed."
"Anybody who knew basketball knew Kobe was easily better on both sides of the ball. Iverson won MVP because he was flashy, his teammates were great defenders and not spectacular offensiuvley which got peopel to assume he was playing with trash and they won 50+ games.    It's narrative   Russell Westbrook wasn't better than Curry in 2017, KD wasn't better than Lebron in 2014, Dirk wasn't better than Duncan in 2007, David Robinson wasn't better than Hakeem in 1995, etc   MVP is about having a great  REGULAR SEASON not necessarily the best as long with a narrative, story and having a flashy game helps    MVP Does not make someone the best at their position"
"This was done like February, it’s wildly inaccurate in some spots regarding some guys like Tatum who improved a lot in season.  But:   1. Lebron 2. AD 3. Kawhi 4. Steph 5. Durant* 6. Giannis 7. Harden 8. Doncic 9. George 10. Embiid 11. Jokic 12. Siakam 13. Butler 14. Dame 15. Beal 16. KAT 17. Simmons 18. Gobert 19. CP3 20. Draymond 21. Klay 22. Bam 23. Tatum 24. Oladipo* 25. Booker 26. Holiday 27. Kemba 28. Mitchell 29. Irving???? 30. McCollum???? 31. Vucevic 32. Lowry 33. Hayward???? 34. Ingram???? 35. Middleton 36. Brown 37. Tobias 38. Wiggins 39. JJJ 40. Westbrook* 41. Horford 42. Lopez 43. Millsap 44. Nurkic 45. Sabonis 46. Brogdon 47. Fox 48. Trae 49. Isaac 50. Ball 51. Fournier 52. Smart 53. Murray 54. Holmes 55. Russell 56. Zion 57. Levert 58. Lavine  After Lavine I had guys like Wall, Turner, Ayton, Griffin, who have cases over Lavine too.  There’s probably a lot wrong with the rankings because I haven’t watched a whole lot of every player; I haven’t compared these to impact metrics either. But I think there’s an argument, in one way or another, that Lavine is closer to 50 than 20."
"John Wall has spent his entire career playing at the same time as two or three top-10 all time point guards depending on where you place Russell Westbrook. The one year Wall can reasonably say he beat CP3, Isaiah Thomas had a career year and capped it off by burying Wall's Wizards in the playoffs. Kyrie Irving also had a pretty strong case that year himself.  I'll say it. John Wall has never been top 3 at his position. It's not a stretch to say he was #4 for a few years, but that's the difference between all-star and all-time."
"I think he's more saying that relative to what other teams have gotten for stars recently, the immediate return easily could've been better. Before going to Indiana, Sabonis was a promising role player, and Oladipo was more a decent starter. At the time the trade was made, that's easily worse than what OKC got for Paul George or Russell Westbrook, and than what NO got for Anthony Davis. Since they developed to the caliber of players that they have, it's still been a really good trade for Indiana, but that's far from a given, provided what they appeared to have gotten right away."
"Sure thing. I also failed to mention that I incorporated Win Shares as well as games played, since nobody makes the Hall as a player on only a couple of peak seasons.   Three caveats to the list:   1. For anyone upset with MJ at #5, those years playing baseball hurt him in basically every category as he wasn't adding to his already impressive list of accolades (would've meant additional All-Stars, All-NBAs, Win Shares, Gs Played and potentially All-Defense). Similarly, Magic is hurt by having his career interrupted/cut short by HIV. 2. Finding a list of all players with an NBA championship is very difficult and would be very time-consuming (and manual) for me, so while it contributes to the overall score of each player, the list of players that have titles to their names is incomplete (particularly if they have just 1), so the list should definitely be considered a work-in-progress. 3. It is a ranking of careers, not talent or peak skill level. So if you think I have slighted Wilt or Bill Russell in any way, just know that every single player in the top-21 of this list has double-digit All-Stars, 9+ All-NBA (10+ if you exclude KG) and several have double-digit All-Defense selections as well. I elected to make MVP, DPOY and ROY binary as this was originally intended to be predictive of Hall consideration and haven't revisited that decision since, though there is probably a good case to do so as multiple MVPs is indicative of a very impressive career. So, again, work in progress.  Without further ado, here is the list (as well as the scores for the top-20):  1. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (43.37) 2. Tim Duncan (42.23) 3. Kobe Bryant (40.76) 4. LeBron James (39.77) 5. Michael Jordan (37.51) 6. Shaquille O'Neal (35.69) 7. Karl Malone (34.85) 8. **Hakeem Olajuwon (34.00)** 9. Kevin Garnett (33.93) 10. Wilt Chamberlain (33.43) 11. David Robinson (32.80) 12. Bill Russell (30.91) 13. Oscar Robertson (30.47) 14. Dirk Nowitzki (30.27 15. Larry Bird (30.14) 16. Jerry West (29.87) 17. John Havlicek (28.83) 18. Charles Barkley (28.80) 19. Bob Pettit (28.76) 20. Bob Cousy (28.38) 21. Magic Johnson (28.17) 22. Chris Paul 23. Kevin Durant 24. John Stockton 25. Moses Malone 26. Dolph Schayes 27. Gary Payton 28. Dwyane Wade 29. Scottie Pippen 30. Allen Iverson 31. Jason Kidd 32. Julius Erving 33. Elgin Baylor 34. Russell Westbrook 35. Dwight Howard 36. James Harden 37. Patrick Ewing 38. Steve Nash 39. Walt Frazier 40. Stephen Curry 41. Elvin Hayes 42. Willis Reed 43. Dave Cowens 44. Hal Greer 45. Dominique Wilkins 46. Clyde Drexler 47. George Gervin 48. Carmelo Anthony 49. Bill Sharman 50. Dikembe Mutombo (17.51)"
"Your friend is not a fan of light skins:  &gt;Bradley Beal is better than Luka Dončić &gt; &gt;Dwight Howard currently is better than Brook Lopez &gt; &gt;David Robinson is arguably better than Tim Duncan &gt; &gt;Dirk Nowitzki is not a top 5 PF of all-time &gt; &gt;Elgin Baylor, Kevin Durant, Julius Erving, and Scottie Pippen, are all better than Larry Bird &gt; &gt;Jayson Tatum is better than Luka Dončić &gt; &gt;John Stockton is vastly overrated &gt; &gt;Karl Malone is better than Tim Duncan &gt; &gt;Karl-Anthony Towns is better than Nikola Jokić &gt; &gt;Larry Bird is not a top 5 SF of all-time &gt; &gt;Nikola Jokić is barely better than Andre Drummond &gt; &gt;Oscar Robertson is better than Stephen Curry &gt; &gt;Robert Covington is better than Domantas Sabonis &gt; &gt;Stephen Curry has barely been better than other elite point guards such as Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, and Russell Westbrook his entire career &gt; &gt;Tim Duncan is not the best PF of all-time &gt; &gt;Walt Frazier is better than Stephen Curry"
Anything good about my boy Russell Westbrook. Yall been haters for year until he went to the rockets then yall started sucking his balls ya 2 faced bastards.
Russell Westbrook is a better all around basketball player than Stephen Curry.   Caveat: He is also overly emotional too often and plays himself out of the game. Really holds him back from reaching the highest of heights.
"I'll eat those downvotes, but I disagree with this take.   TLDR: Small Market teams absolutely compete, just with smaller contention windows.  * There's 1 team that will always be attractive to free agents (Lakers)  * There's another few teams that will be attractive destinations as long as they're run well (Celtics, Knicks, Heat)  * There's another few teams that are in places that allow their contention window to maaaaybe be a little longer than other places (Bulls, Nets, Clippers, Warriors, Rockets, 76ers, Mavericks), but Warriors and Clippers were jokes.  * Then all the rest is a total grab bag (Magic landed Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady, Suns landed Steve Nash, Wizards landed Arenas, Spurs got Finley and Aldridge, Hawks got Mutombo, etc).   And that's not even counting that tons of home-grown stars actually stay in their cities for a significant part of their careers (Russell Westbrook, John Wall, Damian Lillard) and within the last 15 years (LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tim Duncan, Chris Webber, Jermaine O'Neal, Zach Randolph) all made $$$ on really small market teams."
Just going to start listing some. Currys terrible defense doesn’t hurt him in discussions about his greatness. Klay isn’t likeable. Beal should have made the all star team over any of the Celtics even Tatum. The 3pt shot has made the NBA worse in the long run. Steve Kerr is an average coach. Kareem is the GOAT. The Bulls would not have won 8 straight. Adam Silver is overrated. Russell Westbrook and Harden shouldn’t be hated for their playstyles
wow the disrespect towards Russell Westbrook...
"&gt; Jordan had a standing vertical of 36"",  Jw, where did you get that info? I can't imagine that prime MJ's no-step vert was only 36"".. For a point of comparison, Tristan Wirfs, a 320-pound offensive lineman out of Iowa, no-stepped 36.5"" at the NFL Combine this year   Then again, Russell Westbrook somehow recorded a no-step of 30"" at the NBA combine. I think there has to be some difference in how the NBA and NFL measure the jump. Idk how else to explain these differences, lol"
"Russell Westbrook is one of the most beloved teammates and respected players of his era. As far as I can see, one teammate criticized him and that was Reggie Jackson. KD as quiresultan even referred to Westbfook as the only teammate that could help him win a title in OKC. He's got the respect of virtually every top NBA star. (Warriors guys probably the only exception) Whether its Lebron, AD or Giannis, to legends like Kobe, Jordan or Shaq. The guys plays hard, obviously, and that can irk guys, but hes never been a dirty player.    If it's a matter of him not being as good as he thinks, especially on D, that can be said for everybody not named Giannis, KD, Kawhi or Lebron (though his defense has been as bad as westbrook on ball since leaving the heat). If it's for his play style, check out how serious the guys who comment on the difficulty of playing with Lebron are taking, standing in the corner taking skip passes to shoot 3s being told to be happy to be on the court, and not to forget Luka, Harden or any other ball dominant player the last 30 years.   Westbrook and the media dont get along obviously, doesn't mean we have to routinely diminish every accomplishment of his. I dont know what it is, whether they think hes too arrogant which lol look at all the players in this league, or if he reminds them of all the jock assholes they never liked which even I can see, but they've routinely helped to undermine one of the most entertaining players in the history of the league and one of the best of the last 20."
Lemme see Russell Westbrook do THAT
Pure point guards:  1. John Stockton  2. Steve Nash  3. Isiah Thomas  4. Jason Kidd  5. Rajon Rondo  Scoring point guards:   1. Magic Johnson  2. Oscar Robertson  3. Stephen Curry  4. Allen Iverson  5. Jerry West  Honorable mention: Russell Westbrook
"Russell, Wilt and Kareem destroy the math. Kareem has one fewer MVP (6) than there were different winners this past decade (7: James, Rose, Durant, Curry, Westbrook, Harden, Antetokounmpo)."
"[Wojnarowski] The Rockets prepare a trade package for Giannis Antetokounmpo including Russell Westbrook, sources tell ESPN"
I once vehemently defended DJ Augustin as a better PG than Russell Westbrook. (They were rookies).
"2002 team is pretty damn stacked and balanced. I know the 2003 team gets more love, but having Kidd to run the offense instead of KG out there makes this team more well-rounded.  F: Tim Duncan   F: Tracy McGrady   C: Shaquille O'Neal   G: Kobe Bryant   G: Jason Kidd  Also, I know this is kinda cheating, but a revised version of the 2016 All-NBA teams would produce a really dominant lineup.  F: LeBron James  F: Kawhi Leonard  C: DeAndre Jordan ==&gt; Draymond Green  G: Stephen Curry  G: Russell Westbrook ==&gt; Kevin Durant  Draymond could knock down 3s that year and played DPOY level defense in the playoffs and regular season. I know people are going to clamor about Hakeem cooking him, but damn this lineup would be God-level small ball play."
"The 2 slot is a cursed pick. Evan Turner was a 2nd pick too, and while he’s better than MKG, he isn’t what you’d expect from pick that high.  Edit: from 2003, here are notably bad 2 picks with players picked close after them that were great  03: Darko Milicic (Melo, DWade, Bosh)  05: Marvin Williams (Deron Williams, CP3)  07: Kevin Durant (ha you thought)  08: Michael Beasley (Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, and in fairness this pick was 100% justifiable at the time)  09: Hasheem Thabeet (Harden, Curry, DeMar)  10: Evan Turner (Boogie, Hayward, PG13, damn this draft class had some awful injury luck)  11: Derrick Williams (Valanciunas, Klay, Kawhi, in fairness this draft class is more backloaded than most as Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler also fell really far)  12: MKG (Beal, Lillard, Barnes/Drummond)  13: Jabari Parker (Embiid, Aaron Gordon, in fairness this was also an entirely justifiable pick at the time, but curses don’t care about justifiability)  17: Lonzo (Lonzo is the *FURTHEST THING FROM A BUST*, but that being said, I would prefer Tatum, Fox and Mitchell over him for the foreseeable future, though he’s in a great place in New Orleans rn)  18: Marvin Bagley (I love Bagley, but same as above, you would def rather have Luka or Trae Young rn, though I also still think he’s on track to become an All-Star level player in the future and will justify his pick slot).  If you wanna go further back in time, Bowie was the 2nd pick between Hakeem and MJ, and Barkley and Stockton went off the board in the first round. Justifiable motivation for picking him at the time, but oof."
"TIL that Russell Westbrook is ""anyone"""
"Steven Adams, Russell Westbrook and Giannis Antetokounmpo"
"&gt; I won't even put Lebron on here as he is a freak physically that would prob dominate multiple sports, the same with Russell Westbrook.  There are plenty of athletes that are Westbrook's size and put up much better combine stats.  His athleticism in the NFL would be merely good, not elite."
"Patty Mills, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Russell Westbrook, Marcus Smart, Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, tons of other guys."
"There is def a body that is built for basketball. Jordan, Giannis, David Robinson, Dr. J and Wilt all had perfect bodies and athleticism to dominate the game.   I won't even put Lebron on here as he is a freak physically that would prob dominate multiple sports, the same with Russell Westbrook.   Lean, long, strong, quick and explosive. To make it to the NBA at smaller size and dominate, you would have to be ridiculously skilled.   Allen Iverson (a freak athlete too) was one of the most skilled players ever, the same with Chris Paul and Steph Curry."

"If you want an actual 7-game series with 10-player rotations, let’s add the second teams.  1987-88 All-NBA second team: John Stockton (Utah Jazz), Clyde Drexler (Portland Trail Blazers), Dominique Wilkins (Atlanta Hawks), Karl Malone (Utah Jazz), Patrick Ewing (New York Knicks)  2012-13 All-NBA second team. F: Carmelo Anthony, New York Knicks, F: Blake Griffin, L.A. Clippers, C: Marc Gasol, Memphis Grizzlies, G: Tony Parker, San Antonio Spurs, G: Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder  1987-88 wins in 5 or 6 games on a neutral court IMO."
You might be thinking of when Russell Westbrook took an elbow to the face and legit had an indent on his cheekbone !
"This is a fun idea:  1) Golden State Warriors: Michael Jordan. It's very tempting to take Wilt, Russell, or Shaq here, but you can't pass up MJ. It would be incredible to watch him attack with the spacing Curry and Thompson would provide.   2) Cleveland Cavaliers: Wilt Chamberlain. Cleveland has some talent, but they aren't set at any positions. Lots of players could go here, but Wilt is the best on the board.  3) Minnesota Timberwolves: Larry Bird. With Towns and Russell locking down the PG and Centre position, Bird fits in greatly at the wing.  4) Atlanta Hawks: Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Sure they have Capela, but let's get real here, some people still consider KAJ to be the greatest with valid reasoning. So even though they are weaker in other positions, Kareem and Trae could be the highest scoring duo in the league.  5) Detroit Pistons: Magic Johnson. Detroit is similar to Cleveland (since Griffin's future seems questionable with the injuries) in respect to not being set at any position. Magic is the best player on the board and could certainly turn the Pistons around.  6) New York Knicks: Bill Russell. This teams needs to reset their culture and what better player to do than Bill Russell?   7) Chicago Bulls: Shaq. We are talking prime Shaq here. He would demolish small ball lineups and really open the floor for White, Lavine, and Markkanen.  8) Charlotte Hornets: Tim Duncan. Charlotte needs all the help they can get and TD would be a great start. He could easily be the top centre in today's game and would have no trouble adjusting to the changes in the game.  9) Washington Wizards: Hakeem Olajuwon. Hakeem would complete a big 3 with Wall (assuming he's healthy) and Beal. They cover the three main positions and Hakeem could honestly be better in today's game than he was when he was playing.  10) Phoenix Suns: Kevin Garnett. Similar to New York, this teams needs someone who can embody a winning and passionate culture. You can't deny KG's passion for winning. KG has the skills to be both a modern day PF and C and is a good enough shooter he can share the floor with Ayton. KG wins mutliple DPOY awards in today's game.  11) San Antonio Spurs: Kobe Bryant. The Spurs are a weird team right and there's no perfect fit. But the Spurs are well aware of Kobe's abilities and I think he would fit better with DeRozan than most would think.  12) Sacramento Kings: Julius Erving. This team is weakest at the 3 and Erving is the best 3 on the board. This team has talent, but Erving gives them the consistent scoring they need night in and night out.   13) New Orleans Hornets: David Robinson. There are better players on the board, but Robinson fills the need. They have scoring with Ingram, Holiday, Redick, and Williamson. They have ball handlers and defensive wings with Holiday and Ball. Robinson is a defensive anchor who has definitely fit nicely next to Zion on offense.  14) Portland Trailblazers: Charles Barkley. Scottie Pippen fits very well here too, but this team is a bit weaker at the 4 (I'm not sold on Collins being a 4 in today's game) trying to Lillard, McCollum, and Barkley all from scoring will be a challenge for any team.  15) Orlando Magic: Oscar Robertson. As good as Fultz has been, this team could use an upgrade at the PG position. But there is enough size they could play together defensively. Robertson and Vucevic could be a deadly PnR combo.  16) Brooklyn Nets: Scottie Pippen. This team has all the scoring it needs with Irving and Durant. Pippen gives them a top notch defender who can be trusted to run the offense and score if Durant or Irving is out.  17) Memphis Grizzles: Dwyane Wade. Questionable fit next to Morant, but peak Wade is arguable a top 10 player. A team with two defenders quick enough to stay in front of Wade and Morant will be tough to find.  18) Dallas Mavericks. Dirk Nowitzki. It would be wrong for him to end up anywhere else.  19) Indiana Pacers: Elgin Baylor. Baylor can play either F positions which is where this team needs the most help. Baylor is also as pure of scorer as anyone and the consistent 25 points a game is really what this team needs.  20) Philadelphia 76ers: Steve Nash. I'm in the camp that Ben Simmons is fine as the starting PG. Put shifting him to the 4 and having both Simmons and Nash playmaking abilities in the starting lineup would be a lot of fun. It could also allow Simmons to destroy team's second units off the dribble too. Nash helps this team in a lot of ways, but his elite shooting is why he's here and not Thomas or Stockton.  21) Houston: Ben Wallace. This will definitely be the most questionable pick. But anyone who watched Wallace play knows how good he was on defense and that he was the most important player on those Piston teams in the mid 2000s  (sorry Billups). While he doesn't have the spacing Houston is going for, he's the best defensive player available at a position they are in desperate need of help. They have all the offense they could possible need in Harden and Westbrook, they have shooters, they have defenders. The need an elite defensive big and they don't get more elite defensively than Ben Wallace.  22) OKC Thunder: Karl Malone. Malone provides excellent defense and will certainly be this team's top scorer.   23) Miami Heat: John Stockton. Stockton is arguably the second best PG of all-time and it goes to show how PG heavy the league is that he's at 23. This team as Dragic and Nunn, but you move those guys for a player the calibre of Stockton. He can match the intensity of Butler and no backcourt duo will be outworked.  24) Utah Jazz: Bob Pettit. These is a fit concern, but talent can overide fit, and Pettit has a lot of that. This Jazz team would give up few second chance opportunities and Pettit  can give them a low-post scoring threat they haven't seen since Malone (sorry Boozer).   25) Denver Nuggets: Jason Kidd. Kidd brings elite defense and allows Murray to focus more on scoring which is his best skill. As good as Jokic is, Kidd gives the offense a bit more unpredictability and raises the team's defense.  26) Boston Celtics: Moses Malone. Malone is of the best low-post scorers of all-time and would give the Celtics a threat to score from anywhere on the floor. He also helps this team greatly on the boards.  27) L.A Clippers: Gary Payton. Playing the Clippers would be a PG's nightmare. Payton might be the best defensive PG of all-time and then having Beverley come off the bench to guard you too? You could put a scoring big out there or even another shooter, but Payton/Leoard/George would be the best defensive perimeter trio ever seen and I wouldn't want to see that passed up.  28) Toronto Raptors: Patrick Ewing. Gasol is showing his age and while Ibaka has been playing great, throwing a talent like Ewing on this Raptor teams makes a repeat championship a likely scenario. Ewing has shown he can provide spacing, gives the team another scoring threat, and really helps on the boards.  29) L.A Lakers: Isiah Thomas. Again, Thomas being this low shows how deep the PG position is right now. Thomas will allow LeBron to play the 4 like he did in Miami and Davis can spend more time at the 5 depending on the match-up.   30) Milwaukee Bucks: Ray Allen. There are some more talented players, but Allen would fit in perfectly with Giannis/Middleton/Bledsoe/Lopez."
"&gt; but so was Mac.  His teams performed better when he wasn't on the team ball hogging for his chuck shots. That's why the Rockets advanced to the second round when he got injured - he was no longer ball hogging and chucking shots.  T-Mac is all empty stats. He scores 30 points but they don't mean anything. T-Mac was just never championship material. Not only did he never win a series, but he blew 3 series when having a 2 game lead.  T-Mac is a poor man's version of Allen Iverson or Russell Westbrook."
"All these positions are pretty useless anyways. Basketball can be played so many ways with so many skillsets that putting guys in boxes like point guard and shooting guard is borderline useless. Russell Westbrook plays pretty differently from Chris Paul and they both play very differently from Steph and they all play differently than Harden. Then you have guys like Stockton and Magic and it becomes silly to label these guys as playing the same ""position"" when their only real similarity is that they handle the ball more than other players (and in the case of Curry that's almost not even true)."
But the team was notably worse during this period and at the end of the day that truly does mark a return of Russell Westbrook.
"So this little man whos done nothing in the finals, no finals MVP. Gets outplayed by Raptors point guards who have been trash all playoffs and went berserk after getting matched up against a little chair. Can't even outscore Kawhi who had no legs. Gives up the most embarrassing lead in finals history. Gets dumpstered by Kyrie to lose a 3-1 lead. Begs Kevin Durant to help him win a chip. Only won chip against a team with no one. Worst clutch performer in the playoffs after Russell Westbrook. Is somehow the best player in the league? After we just saw him being completely ineffective without Klay on the court? When Lilard and Kyrie are showing how much better they are throughout this season? Dude's not even the best PG in the league and you're claiming no. 1 overall?  And your evidence for him being the best is? That he managed to get 30ppg in the finals being a one way player, matched up against a bench player Vanvleet?  A series in which he stat padded just to lose in 6? How many points did this dude give up? No mention of that?   That he has 3 rings? 2 of which he got carried by Kevin Durant who thoroughly destroyed Lebron 1 on 1? 1 ring in which he won because Kyrie went down game 1? And still couldn't win finals mvp? What weak reasoning for a sad Steph fangay, all your points are so weak and you need a level of mental gymnastics that just discredits your case.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpjtV4qjJBU Here, more Steph choking. Thats your no. 1 player. The only way this dude will win another chip is if he manages to beg another elite small forward to carry him or the coronavirus kills the top 5 SFs in the league."
"No thanks. One series, again, that went to game 7, does not tell the story of his career with the franchise. Maybe if KD had a pg he could trust not to jack up shots when he isn't even a decent shooter, he wouldn't have forced things quite as often. Anyways, if your gonna have somebody forcing shots on your team, would you rather it be Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook?"
"&gt; assertive, and is an amazing leader.  I don't know, man. One of the biggest problems Obi and Anakin faced (with good writing, at least) was how stern and strict Obi was and how he was ""rules over all"" for a part of his life. He got looser with time but Lillard strikes me as a more relaxed leader.   He's always about ""we don't do that here"" in the sense of not  blaming each other and being a community but can handle different types of personalities (whiteside being on a contract year might have helped, true, but that's a statement  of how he handles different dudes)  I do love the Russell Westbrook and Mace Windu comparison, at least for a point in their careers. It's not that they were not good Jedi/player or a bad member of the order/partner but their ""my way or the high way"" could create conflict (Windu dealing with Anakin. Westbrook and, let's say, his shot selection)   ON another note, what about KD and Kylo Ren? Sure, you lose the father narrative but the legacy one gets so much stronger. Both insecure guys about their legacy/self (hope this doesn't come off as insulting KD, talking about his public persona) that strived for a moment where they surpassed their idols/paternal figures/previous legacy holders (Luke in the salt planet and Lebron with that shot in the finals) that ended up souring.  If u/sims888 could make an image of Yoda with that Chris Paul's meme i don't know if that'd be a dream or a nightmare come true"
"Also one of only six players to average 27/7/7.  Luka Doncic (1), Michael Jordan (1), Russell Westbrook (2), John Havlicek (2), LeBron James (6), Oscar Robertson (6)"
"That's really hard to say, i wouldn't fault any player for sitting out, but would the playoffs have the same legitimacy if Jaylen Brown and Russell Westbrook sat out, for example?  Even though their teams aren't REAL contenders i feel like it would make the playoffs feel way less pristine and legitimate.  Edit: By real contenders i mean not being the LA teams and Milwaukee."
nah cuz if they won in 2016 they wouldn't get KD and they would still be the massive favourites for 2017 and 2018 barring catastrophe  just because you are a russell westbrook fan doesn't mean you have to act like a know it all
"Russell Westbrook fares extremely well in the advanced stats department. For example, [8th in LA-RAPM from 2012-17](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm5?id=2031507149), or top 15 in RPM for 6 of 7 seasons from 2014 to 2020."
"The advanced stats are primarily equation based, while box stats are just raw numbers. Historically, Russell Westbrook is great in the box score but horrible in some important advanced stats"
"Agreed! Dirk being at the top of the RAPM leaderboards so consistently makes me feel better about some of the more controversial findings, like Russell Westbrook not having much impact on the court in 2018-2019."
"He actually averaged 29/9/9   the only players to ever average his exact splits of 28.7 ppg - 9.3 rpg - 8.7 apg are      -	1961 Oscar Robertson, 62 Oscar Robertson and 64 Oscar Robertson  -	2017 Russell Westbrook -	2020 Luka Doncic   The only players to ever average 0 ppg - 9.3 rpg - 8.7 apg in a season are   -	Oscar Robertson ( 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964) -	Russell Westbrook (2017, 2018, 2019) -	Magic Johnson (1982) -	Luka Doncic (2020)         And that’s the full list"
"Russell Westbrook, Jordan Clarkson"
"&gt; he shot 72% at the rim this season.  Yeah, that's what I mean. Big men always have good FG%'s around the rim that boost their overall efficiency by a heft amount.   To still be sub-par with that boost is pretty wild.   It's not just that he has Russell Westbrook efficiency, it's that he has  Russell Westbrook efficiency while playing with a huge efficiency handicap.   It's like failing a test after the teacher has already given you half the answers."
"We didn’t expect LeBron to be a champion for justice, that’s the picture he imposed on himself. He has tried damn hard to present himself as one, but when it actually got to the point where taking a stance would have cost him money, he chickened. You can notice how no one cared that, say, Russell Westbrook didn’t take a stance on China situation, since he never tried to present himself as a champion for justice."

"I watched a couple of Warriors/Thunder games a few weeks ago (Curry game winner in OT, Klay 11 threes playoff game). what stuck out to me like a sore thumb was that the Thunder would take forever to get into their offense and their shots weren't high quality at all, whereas the Warriors got into their offense quickly and took their time to find the best possible shot. Stuff like that, plus making effort/hustle plays (Thunder players were absolutely lackadaisical at the end of Game 6, resulting in costly turnovers), running more creative sets than the Thunder, having better reserves and role players - that made all the difference for the Warriors.  Watching those two games alone makes you appreciate just how hard it is to reach the Finals, because you have to be top-tier everything - players, coaching staff, management, etc. You slip up on some of those things like the Thunder did, and suddenly you're not good enough. It also shows how lazy the ""They were up 3-1!"" take is, since it disregards the true natures of those teams: the Thunder were a very streaky team that season, the Warriors were just flat out better than the Thunder and wanted to go to the Finals more badly, and that showed itself by the end of that infamous WCF series.  I was initially on the ""fuck Kevin Durant"" train, but as the Thunder continued to fizzle out in the first round despite getting Paul George, it became pretty clear to me that KD not only did what was best for him, he also dodged a bullet. Russell Westbrook was declining athletically, the supporting cast wasn't getting any better (ie. the Trail Blazers exposed them for being awful at shooting the ball), and there was no real way for Presti to improve the team because the team was capped out. All those management mistakes, like trading Harden, drafting bust after bust, and acquiring below-mediocre veterans to fill out the bench and call it a day, had caught up to the Thunder eventually.  Harsh truth, I know, but that's the way it is... \*shrug\*"
Mitchell Robinson has a higher PER than Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook this season. It's weighted towards big men and generally just not useful
"Kawhi used to be my favorite player in the league. What happened in the past year (even before the ECF) really soured me on him.  My list, in no order:  1: Steph Curry  2: Tim Duncan  3: Manu Ginobili  4: Russell Westbrook  5: Dirk Nowitzki"

Bruh I was lost I first thought Russell Westbrook?
"There's a difference between saying... as you put it, ""shit up and dribble"", and saying what LeBron James, Austin Rivers, and others are saying, and things that players like Russell Westbrook support, which is that they can use the platform they'd have while playing to their advantage while fighting for the cause.  The fact that we've already seen players fighting for the cause who have also been vocal about wanting to play kind of crushes your dumbass theory on the spot."
Right? Then you get the Russell Westbrook thing in Utah...
"10 total results, only four active players have achieved 27/7/7 in a season.  (6) LeBron (#1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 in TS%)  (2) Russell Westbrook (#9 and 10 in TS%)  (1) Harden (#2 in TS%)  (1) Doncic (#6 in TS%)"
"https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1271620752769454080?s=20   Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony were among the prominent voices on the Kyrie Irving-organized player call tonight, league sources  Chris Paul, NBPA president, took part as well"
"Honestly, I think the political neutrality of sports actually makes a lot more people less racist than any BLM protest. A BLM protest might be needed to push forward changes in law... but in terms of reducing racism in the minds of racists, I think it does mostly the opposite... and its things like sports which actually open up people's minds to acceptance and understanding. People are racist for very very stupid reasons... they grow up in a culture where you dehumanize the outsider... but when the redneck who loves basketball follows Russell Westbrook and sees his passion for competition and sticking with his team, he ends up admiring something in a member of the race he normally denigrates. I really think most racism gets extinguished via positive relationships, friendships, idols, etc. It's hard to grow up a white supremacist when one of your best friends is black, despite the rhetoric that it's the worst defense against an accusation of racism.   That's not to say the players are silly for thinking otherwise. But I genuinely think most people underestimate the power of community and friendships to change people's bigoted ideas."

"If we had a good all-in-one stat then we would be able to look at it like a player ranking, like WAR in baseball. If a stat sees Russell Westbrook as more valuable than Bird then it's either limited in scope or very flawed, and PER is not limited in scope."
"Outside of the top 2 it's an absolute mess if you're trying to look at it like a player ranking. Anthony Davis 3rd, Bob Pettit 7th, Russell Westbrook 20th, Larry Bird 21st, Bill Russell 118th. It can be that bad."
"I think Wade’s slashing style would translate extremely well to today’s era. He would wreak so much havoc with the floor spaced the way it is, and the pace being higher. Basically a smarter more controlled Russell Westbrook with better finishing at the rim."
"Not holding players of the same caliber to equal standards clearly because one is “likeable” and the other isn’t. You’ll often see people on this sub use mental gymnastics to justify their narratives.   Common example:   “Russell Westbrook is a playoff choker and not a winner”  “Damian Lillard just hasn’t had enough help”  In reality both are basically just as inefficient in the playoffs and Dame was able to win a 7 game playoff series while playing poorly which doesn’t fit the no help narrative.  Also while Westbrook has indeed never made it out the first round as the #1 option, both times Lillard did it was against a Clippers team with no Chris Paul or Blake Griffin and a banged up Thunder team. He’s not much better."

"No. Jason Terry was there from the 06 finals run. And Jason Kidd was not required to score during his twilight years.

"MVP doesn't mean best player. Dwight led his team to the 4th seed, that's not getting you an MVP. Russell Westbrook is the exception, not the norm."
"Russell Westbrook actually won the MVP and also finished top 5 in 3 other seasons, but he's always been borderline top 5, often just out of the top 5 (behind guys like LeBron, Durant, Harden, Steph, and Kawhi). I feel like that's where CP3 was for most of his peak... in that 5-7 range.   Maybe my memory is clouded but I don't remember them saying ""wow, the Lakers are about to acquire a top 5 player in the league in CP3 to pair with another top 5 player in Kobe."""
"It's not terrible, but certainly not anything to suggest he's a future offensive superstar.  Nobody really uses 2p%, but comparing it to some other players 49% isn't very good.  His 3p% is fine, but he only takes 1.6 a game so it doesn't help him a lot.  His ts%, which I think is a better measure than 2p% or 3p%, is about the same as Russell Westbrook on much lower volume."
"Kobe's impact cannot be denied as he nearly three-peated the moment he got a decent team. That 2006 Lakers was historically bad and he had an historically great season.  Russell Westbrook won the MVP in a lower seeded squad, because he had the best season, the MVP award is an individual award, it's ludicrous to hold someone's historic season down because they played in a garbage team."
"Let’s not forget Russell westbrook went all in for China’s anti-hongkong push last year, hand in hand with Harden."
I will die on my Russell Westbrook hill.
"Jason Kidd is one of only three players in NBA history to average a triple-double over the course of an entire post-season run. The other two being Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook.   The only difference is, Kidd did it over the course of 12 games whereas Roberson and Westbrook did it over the course of only 5 games each."

Is Russ Russell Westbrook? I've never really heard Russell Westbrook be referred to as anything other than Russell Westbrook so double checking.
"I dunno man, tell that to Ja Morant, Ben Simmons, and Russell Westbrook."
"I’m not a big fan of Russell Westbrook the basketball player, but he is an awesome dude as a person. It’s terrible that some idiot Utah Jazz fan heckled him in a racist manner, but his response to that was effective and I think the situation made everyone more aware of themselves. I also love his competitive spirit, he doesn’t take shit from anyone"
"I fucking love this man.   I stan'd Iverson growing up because of the flashy play and cool bravado. But Russ is probably the first player I've ever been truly enamored by. I have his OKC jersey, [*The Misunderstood Genius of Russell Westbrook*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/magazine/the-misunderstood-genius-of-russell-westbrook.html) is my favorite NBA player article (I hope this isn't paywalled), and I'll always defend this dude despite the vocal amount of fans who criticize his play style."
"Russell Westbrook is Bodie from the Wire, Kevin Durant is the snake from Sanjay &amp; Craig, Harden is Yosemite Sam from Looney toons  LeBron, Kobe, and MJ are the Three Billy Goats Gruff  Charles Barkley is Porky Pig   Larry Bird is Big Bird  Wilt Chamberlain is Wilt from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends"

"i mean, you can. russell has a better contract than like, wall or westbrook. my point was more that most of the players this sub says are overpaid are just making the new normal for the nba. and i meant that about russell even tho i wasn't quite clear"
"True, this was more to highlight how Houston's spacing has produced the most efficient version of Russell Westbrook we've seen yet.   I wish OKC had tried surrounding him some shooters earlier, like the Bucks have with their similarly athletic and shooting-challenged superstar, Giannis.  Also, 4 of those 6 losses have come against the Knicks, Suns, Magic, and the Hornets. Are Houston just mailing it in against below .500-teams? They aren't good enough yet to afford to do that, lol."
"&gt;  The value of spacing. Capela-era Russell Westbrook: 26.3 ppg on 52.6 TS% ;  Post-Capela Russell Westbrook: 31.0 ppg on 57.5 TS%. (Shoutout to James Harden, who will pretty much keep getting his regardless of who's around him - Capela-era: 35.7 ppg on 61.6 TS%, post-Capela- 31.0 ppg on 61.4 TS%.).      Still not convinced in the viability of this strategy, it helps the star players get their numbers but at the expense of their role players. The Rockets had an 8-6 WL record in the small ball era."
"Dirk Nowitzki?    Who averaged 2.4 career assists per game?  Better at throwing a two-handed skip pass than Magic, Bird, Garnett, Duncan, Jokic, Doncic, Kidd, Ginoboli, Harden, Pippen, or Giannis?  This is what you’re telling me?  Better at throwing a skip pass than Andre Miller or Joe Johnson or Mark Jackson or Russell Westbrook or Rajon Rondo or Gary Payton or Bob Cousy or Anthony Mason or Rod Strickland or Michael Jordan or Jason Williams or Dennis Johnson or Mike Bibby or Grant Hill or Ricky Rubio or Karl Malone or Rick Barry or Wes Unseld or Dave Cowens or Kevin Porter or Jamaal Tinsley or Hakeem Olajuwon or Norm Nixon or Mike Bibby or Kenny Anderson or Paul Pierce or Ben Simmons or Oscar Robertson or Chris Paul?"
Dennis Smith Jr - Russell Westbrook
I remember masked Russell Westbrook
"No. Russell Westbrook isn’t famous outside of basketball like Curry, KD and LeBron are. To be a “superstar” you have to be a household name to people who don’t care about basketball like those three are"
"Lotta argument about point guards. Lillard is undisputable.

Which seasons cause Russ I think you’re forgetting the greatness that was Russell Westbrook he’s a top 10 point gaurd ever you don’t replace an all time great with a non all time great and get better
I mean MJ didn't have a Russell westbrook taking just as many shots as him
That was such a fun game — got to glimpse an alternative universe where Steph Curry had his skills but the temperament of Russell Westbrook
Are you aware of the contributions of Russell Westbrook in the all-small-ball era?  He's playing better ball in 2020 than Chris ever did for us.
"I don't know why you both went all ""ackshually"" on me considering Russell Westbrook has the highest single-season usage rate. Michael is at 5. Every single player I listed is higher than him on single season usage rate."
"I don't know why you both went all ""ackshually"" on me considering Russell Westbrook has the highest single-season usage rate. Michael is at 5. Every single player I listed is higher than him on single season usage rate."
"Russell Westbrook also is the most inefficient superstar of this era, who also hasn't won jack shit."
LOL Russell Westbrook.
"Good read.  I personally think we're in a fantastic spot. I love the young core we have and think there's a very solid foundation to build on.  Dejounte is interesting. I absolutely love his work ethic and desire to become great - but his offensive ceiling doesn't appear *too* high. I think he'll be a great role player/fringe All-Star for us and a potential DPOY candidate being the defensive anchor for the team.  Derrick White is great. I think his on-ball defense is fantastic and very underrated by the rest of the NBA. The only downside is he's 25 (26 in a month) and a bit to old to be ushering in a new dynasty with the rest of the younger players. I think if he takes that next step and starts resembling something like that of Manu's play, we'll need to put him as the sixth man to factor in longevity until the other guys reach their primes.  Jakob is a role player that we're gonna need. He's a fantastic shot blocker and does things on the defensive end that don't necessarily show up on the stat sheet. I think he just needs to put himself in the position to be viable on the pick and roll as well as becoming a better passer and he'll do wonders.  Keldon Johnson has great potential. I see him as something like a Russell Westbrook/Klay Thompson hybrid. I can definitely see him as a starter in due time.  Lonnie Walker is something else entirely. I genuinely see superstar potential in him and think next season is his for the taking. He has all the athletic tools in the world and already has capable jumpshot (Chip is gonna make that even better - you already know). If he's able to work on his finishing, defensive focus, and enhance his BBIQ, the sky is the limit. He's already shown flashes despite Pop making it hard for him to get the green light. Just shave that hair please.  BUT... we need a player to fill the hole that Kawhi left. We need a WING (not undersized either) that can score and has serious defensive prowess - and I think that's gonna come through free agency."
"&gt;On the morning of Nov. 27, Bam Adebayo was told, from the very first moment of that night’s game against the Houston Rockets, his primary defensive assignment would be Russell Westbrook.  [Shit, didn't know this](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/12/12/21012081/bam-adebayo-profile-miami-heat-all-star-calipari-kentucky)  Do you remember what the gameplan was? Was he giving him some space and trying to guard under the basket or was he straight up defending him?"
Surround him with 3&amp;D guys and give him Kobe Bryant - James Harden - Russell Westbrook-level usage rate.
"Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Ibaka. Not like KD played with scrubs."
Just one more reason to love Russell Westbrook
If your from Oklahoma and Russell Westbrook tells you something I don’t care what it is you do it that’s just facts
There are very very few ways you can get the entire city of Oklahoma on your ass faster than being on the bad side of Russell Westbrook. Good to see him and the others are taking this stance and have reached out.
Russell Westbrook has been an MVP.   CASE CLOSED  Lillard did make the Thunder better though by causing us to ship George and Westbrook!  Thanks Dame! Very cool! Enjoy the lotto!
"As a huge iverson stan. I love russell westbrook. Wish the sixers would of traded for him long ago. Too late now, im also very happy with ben simmons. Just need to dump embiid for snipers to showcase bens athleticism more"
"2nd level/B players(Post was too long so had to split it into 2)  The west has a tough group of guys to judge because they split time in both conferences. KG won his MVP in Minny and had some great historic seasons in terms of production, but he also won his DPOY in Boston and a title in Boston but I count him as primarily a Western Conference player as that is where he did most of his damage independently and was in his prime. Celtics KG was just outside of his prime.  Ray Allen racked up points and other stats on the Bucks and Sonics. His celtics years are clearly #3 most important to me in terms of ranking. As a bucks player he made a conference finals and multiple playoffs, and got the name Jesus Shuttlesworth as a Bucks player. Seattle is where he had his greatest years in terms of points/production and has his highest peak as a player. Then he went to Boston and then Miami. So 3 east teams vs 1 west team. I can't give him a conference, his career/achievements are too split for me to make a call on it.  Shaq started in Orlando but he did win 3 FMVPs and won them straight on a 3peat in LA. I have him edged out just barely as a Western player due to his lone MVP and title run in LA. He made the finals with Orlando and they were relatively(still!) a young new team in history and was named as top 50 ever before the age of 24 years old. He left Orlando at age 23 and was named as top 50 ever as a Magic. Had an early best Peak production stats there as well with some 29 and 13 or 29 and 11-12, seasons there. He made the finals with 2 East teams(Orlando, Miami) and got a title in Miami but D Wade definitely was the top dog and Shaq was definitely out of prime for this one but he was still a key contributor. So It's crazy to think about but thats why I have his East and West versions so close. 3 FMVPs are amazing on a 3peat with Wilt stats, but can you guys just fathom being named top 50 ever before the age of 24? 3 different teams in the finals and played both conferences. Wilt started in the East and I count him as an Eastern guy due to his Peak being in the East. Barkley's peak years were all in Philly although he made the finals only with the suns- he is similar to Ray allen in this regard. Peak years on one team, deeper run on another. Chuck spent 8 years in both conferences and I can't place him in either.  &amp;#x200B;  The west has KG(title in Boston but I count him as west. He never was better than his Minnesota self on any team afterwards and he played long enough in the West to be counted as a West guy even if he spent considerable time in the east), Malone, Stockton, Drexler, Gary Payton(title in the east but close to 40 so has no bearing on his Western status), Webber, Reign Man, as some of the great 2nd tier guys that didn't get a title.  Even though J Kidd got a title, I count him as 2nd tier because he wasn't the best player on his team by that time.  &amp;#x200B;  The east has Iverson, Reggie Miller, Pierce, Bosh, Mourning, LJ, Allan Houston, Penny, Grant Hill, Dwight Howard(3-4 DPOY awards, and led a contender to the finals by beating early peak lebron in 09) are some of the 2nd level guys that were high level but didn't win titles. I know I'm missing a lot of names, hopefully you guys can add to this post.  So in order of importance, the east is the Primary conference of importance. Not to mention, the East is a major money maker and is the home of the hustling, and bustling NorthEast Corridor that can be said to stretch from Boston&gt;&gt;&gt;Washington DC. In terms of Dollars, the East brings in and has historically been the money maker for the league.  The East has more high level GOATs  that are ICNONIC, than the West as well. BillyGOAT Russell, Wilt(he's East to me due to peak and mythical status), Dr. J, Bird, Zeke, Jordan, Lebron.  The West has Magic, Kareem, Kobe, Duncan, Shaq but the East GOATs edge them out. Forgot to mention Curry earlier. Curry is tier 1 but he isn't in GOAT talks but he has fulfilled the iconic status in the same way Iverson did. Kids want to be them. Durant is 1st tier as well but I didn't want my post to get derailed by KD hate so I acknowledge him but want good energy and replies to my post hence the minimal mentions of him.  2nd tier level is probably won by the west in terms of Iconic ATGs. Garnett, Malone, The Admiral(he has a title(s) but he stepped back from Timmy post injury), Malone, Drexler, Stockton, Kidd, Webber, Kemp, The Glove, Carmelo, Harden, Westbrook. These guys have MVPs, top status, All NBA guys, All stars, points, you name it.  I know I'm missing out on A LOT, but this post is long enough and I'll spare the masses from futher rambling.  &amp;#x200B;  **TLDR: East is more important to the league in history due to the league starting in the east and spreading west, East has more pedigree with their teams- meaning they have more teams with relevance for multiple generations and new cores of guys, the East has more GOATs, the east has more top 5-10 GOATs.**  **The West is quite formidable but the NBA is east Dominant in story telling due to BillyGOAT Russell, Dr. J, Wilt, Bird, and The GOAT himself, His Airness, Michael Fucking Jordan. East historically is more important revenue wise.**  **The west gets hurt by guys like Ray Allen and Charles Barkley who spent lots of time in both conferences and aren't classified as one coast or the other due to having different key accomplishments in both conferences.**  **The west dominates recent history with LA and SAS, as those 2 teams are responsible for even keeping the race within striking distance.**"
"One time Russell Westbrook came to Taiwan and did a show, he destroyed everyone that went against him.  I live in Taiwan and I did not get tickets, so I stood in the free highrise area and it was pretty cool seeing my favorite nba player of all time wreak some Taiwanese basketball players."
The obvious first  E is Isaiah Thomas  K is Rajon Rondo  L is Russell Westbrook  M is Steph Curry  After that  Chris Paul and John Wall are A and F but I don't know who is which  Is Lillard B?  Is MVP Rose D or G?
I mean. Would D-Wade and Russell Westbrook have some of these aspects?  Westbrook is not a good defender but I dunno.   Pretty hard to say tbh.
Ron Artest - Badger   Reggie Miller - Mouse  Isiah Thomas - Chipmunk   Yao Ming - Giraffe   Russell Westbrook - Turtle  Kevin Durant - Cupcake
"Only reason you can call these guys higher level is because they learned from guys in the past like Russell and Wilt. Not only did Westbrook have the narrative of KD leaving him but he averaged a triple double which hadn’t been done in over 40 years, of course he was going to win. But when you factor in team success, efficiency and proficiency James Harden should’ve won in 2017. It’s just different now, fans have more of a voice due to people on social media who create narratives for their favorite player."
"And then right after this Timmy made a turnaround jumper over Reggie Jackson and Russell Westbrook to put us up three. It was an insane sequence, I was losing my mind when it happened."
Russell Westbrook
I think Russell Westbrook is a better fit
"obviously you cant diagnose ocd based off two excerpts. but those are still definitely symptoms.   ""[My preparation] drives me insane.

"Bucks are a top 2 team in the league with an emerging all-time great so can't go wrong there.  Lakers are also a top 2 team. They have the 2nd best player ever in LeBron and a Top 7ish player Anthony Davis. Plus they're in LA, so they'll almost always have superstars.  There's the Dallas Mavericks who have Luka Doncic who is already one of the best players in his second year. They also have Kristaps Porzingis who is an exciting young player with potential.  Pelicans have Zion Williamson who was the 1st overall pick this year. Ever since he returned from injury, he's been absolutely dominating in only his first year.  Clippers have reigning finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Paul George who is also great.  Nets have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant (KD is out for the season tho). Next year they really have a chance to compete for the championship  The Rockets have James Harden, one of the most prolific scorers ever and is currently averaging 35ppg for the second straight season. Russell Westbrook is also an electrifying top 10 player who's been playing great this year.  Those are just the main teams I'd suggest. Anymore questions let me know."
Yeah idk why fans are so obsessed with players who carry mediocre talent to the playoffs. Like is the pinnacle of your NBA experience watching Russell Westbrook lose in the first round? Or is it watching elite teams with highly talented players who complement each other?
"And what exactly was Jokic's cast 3-4 years ago? I mean Jameer Nelson and Emmanuel Mudiay were starting most games 4 years ago. Kenneth Faried and Darrel Arthur were major rotation pieces.   3 years ago Faried still got lots of starts and rotation time, Wilson Chandler was typically a starter, Plumlee started when Millsap was down for like a third of the season, Darrell Arthur and Trey Lyles were major rotation pieces.   Both years they were 1 game out of the playoffs in a significantly harder conference.  17-18 they would've been 6th in the east. With those players getting tons of starts at court time, and Jamal Murray being 20/21.  4 years ago, Embiid got hurt halfway through, but they were only 17-28 at the time. The nuggets roster the same year wasn't significantly better, but they missed the playoffs by 1 game, in a game winning distance 3 by Russell Westbrook of all people.   The next year, the nuggets finished with 46 wins, only 6 games back of the 76ers who were now starting Simmons and  Reddick.   So given roughly equal talent, Jokic made them a playoff contender in his 2nd year. Embiid was on pace for 30ish wins. Given way better talent, embiid finished 6 games better. Given still better talent but the nuggets also being talented, jokic's team has been better in the regular season and roughly equal in the playoffs.   None of this is to say who the better player is. But Jokic's style does seem to lead to more wins. Embiid may be debatably the better individual player, and a better fit for some teams, but with the info we have, jokic has done more for his teams."
"I agree with the first one, easily. Kawhi played less games, and Draymond was huge in Golden State being one of, if not, the best defensive teams in the NBA that year. Plus, along with Steph and the rest, played a huge rule in Golden State dominating the West that year (2nd place wasn't close).  My other is Avery Bradley not getting 1st or 2nd all defense back in 2016-17 season. He was a huge reason why Boston got the 1 seed in the East (and he wasn't even playing on Booker's 70 points night). IT got it going on offense, but Bradley's defense was critical for them.   Terry Stotts was my Coach of the Year in 2015-16. Damian Lillard should also have been in MVP conversation that year (instead of Russell Westbrook or KD, but not both), as before the season started, even with the West being crap outside the top 4 team, no one had them even close in the playoffs. CJ was amazing and definitely deserved MIP, but even with that, they got 5th seed in the West, when I (and quite a few others) had them very close to last place in the NBA."
"&gt; I mean come on, dude is averaging nearly 30-10 in just his second year... How many more players have ever done that in NBA history?      Oscar Robertson (7x), Tiny Archibald (1x) and Russell Westbrook (1x) are the only players in NBA history to ever match Trae's averages this season for both points and assists in the same year.        - Oscar played at least 43 minutes per game in each of those years.    - Archibald averaged 46 minutes per game.      So I don't want to hear people argue that ""today's pace is faster"" since Young did this in under 35 minutes per game."
This one seems easy to me because he is treated like a megastar but to me is not even close to that tier in terms of impact - Russell Westbrook. He is the only superstar out there that I would not consider to bring automatic contender status with him no matter where he goes.   If that is not the intention of this question than I will go with Butler like others have suggested.
"My thoughts on what the rosters might look like:  Atlanta: Bob Pettit,  Dominque Wilkins  Boston: Larry Bird, Bill Russell  Brooklyn: Jason Kidd, Vince Carter  Charlotte: Kemba Walker, Larry Johnson  Chicago: Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen  Cleveland: Lebron James, Mark Price  Dallas: Dirk Nowitzki, Rolando Blackman  Denver: Carmelo Anthony, Alex English  Detroit: Isiah Thomas, Bob Lanier  Golden St: Wilt Chamberlain, Steph Curry  Houston: Hakeem Olajuwon, James Harden  Indiana: Reggie Miller, Jermaine O'Neal  Clippers: Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo  Lakers: Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson  Memphis: Pau Gasol, Mike Conley Jr  Miami: Dwyane Wade, Alonzo Mourning  Milwaukee: Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Giannis Antetokounmpo  Minnesota: Kevin Garnett, Karl Anthony Townes  New Orleans: Chris Paul, Anthony Davis  New York Knicks: Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier  Oklahoma City: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook  Orlando: Shaquille O'Neal, Dwight Howard  Philadelphia: Julius Erving, Charles Barkley  Phoenix: Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire  Portland: Dame Lillard, Clyde Drexler  Sacramento: Oscar Robertson, Peja Stojakovic  San Antonio: Tim Duncan, George Gervin  Seattle: Ray Allen, Gary Payton  Toronto: Chris Bosh, Kyle Lowry  Utah: John Stockton, Karl Malone  Washington: Elvin Hayes, John Wall"
"He averaged 29-8-4-1-1 and 57.5% TS in his OKC playoff career (91 games).  He went 10-6 in the 16 playoff series that he played.  He got to the Conference Finals - in the West - 4 times in 6 playoffs. In 2013, one of the two seasons that he missed the Conference Finals, his starting point guard and best teammate Russell Westbrook was injured and they downgraded to Reggie Jackson. The other time he missed the Conference Finals was when he was a 21-year-old in this third season, losing in 6 games in the first round to the reigning and eventual repeat champion Lakers.  He won an MVP and came in second only to LeBron 3 other times. He won 4 scoring titles and was very close to a 5th in 2012-2013.  He was All-NBA First Team 5 seasons in a row."
"Because that would be saying he did it intentionally, which he didn't. Like he's said, [he didn't mean to hurt him](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--patrick-beverley-didn-t-want-to-hurt-russell-westbrook--but-not-apologizing-for-play-060139676.html), but he's not going to apologize for a hustle play that many players do all the time, and just went wrong."
"Isn't a guard. Check.   &gt;Brings ball up the court. Check.  [Let's look at guards currently leading the league in touches per game, and see how those touches are distributed:](https://stats.nba.com/players/touches/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G&amp;sort=TOUCHES&amp;dir=1)  Player | Frontcourt | Backcourt | Total ---|---|----|---- Doncic| 33| 61| 94 Simmons | 30 | 62| 92 Graham | 35 | 57| 91 Young |  23| 64 | 87 Harden | 25 | 60 | 85 Lowry| 36| 48| 84 Lillard | 24 | 59 | 83 Russell | 35| 48 | 83  [Now let's look at bigs currently leading the league in touches per game, and see how those touches are distributed:](https://stats.nba.com/players/touches/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=TOUCHES&amp;dir=1&amp;PlayerPosition=C)  Player | Frontcourt | Backcourt | Total ---|---|----|---- Jokic| 58| 40| 98 Sabonis | 52 | 36 | 88 Embiid | 45 | 26 | 71 Towns| 48 | 22 | 70 Randle | 41 | 28 | 69 Vucevic | 45 | 24 | 69 Bam | 40 | 27 | 67 Davis | 42 | 23 | 65 Drummond | 37 | 27 | 64   You see how every single big get the majority of his touches in the frontcourt, while every single guard get the majority of their touches in the backcourt?    That's because the guards are the ones designated to bring the ball up the court.  The bigs sometimes do it, but not often. They mostly wait for the ball to be brought to them.    Bam might occasionally bring the ball up, but so does Vucevic. Neither are PGs.  Bam has 27 backcourt touches per game, which is in line with bigs. Ben has 62 backcourt touches per game, which is in line with guards.   &gt;Handles the ball from top of the key to wings for a hand off or hitting a cutter. Check  Except those aren't point guard responsibilities. That's what big men do.  The big man:  1. Hands off on the perimeter ([Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70rN_O4zfG8)) 2. Facilitates from an established position on the elbow or post ([Note: Bam is 3rd overall in elbow touches](https://stats.nba.com/players/elbow-touch/)) 3. Relies on the speed of his cutting guards/wings   See:  * Jokic * Horford * Draymond * Bogut * Gasol * Duncan  * Garnett * etc.        In fact, the 76ers moved Ben to PF is so they can let him run more of these hand-off plays and facilitate out of the elbow more often. As a guard, he wasn't able to really do that.      &gt;Guards point guards. Check.  Switches onto guards you mean.    Let's look at the top 20 defensive matchups for [Bam](https://stats.nba.com/player/1628389/head-to-head/?sort=PARTIAL_POSS&amp;dir=1) and [Ben](https://stats.nba.com/player/1627732/head-to-head/?sort=PARTIAL_POSS&amp;dir=1):      Bam| Ben ---|--- Vucevic| Butler Collins | Tatum Embiid | Morris Love | Siakam Drummond | **Dinwiddie** - Guard Porzingis| **Middleton** - Guard Horford | **Beal** - Guard Allen | **SGA** - Guard Birch | **Brogdon** - Guard Bjelica | Gordon Gobert | Leonard Turner | **Garland** - Guard Giannis | Hunter  Jackson Jnr| **LaVine** - Guard Hachimura | **Sexton** - Guard Parker | **Lowry** - Guard Randle | DeRozan  Davis | **Barrett** - Guard Harrell | Lebron **Westbrook**- Guard| Warren  You see how Ben Simmons actually has quite a lot of guards in his top matchups list?  That's because he'll have games where he gets assigned guards to defend.   With Bam, he gets assigned PFs/Cs and occasionally switches onto guards. The one exception is Westbrook, who Bam has been assigned to in the past. But it's an interesting exception because:  1. He hasn't been shooting much this season  2. The Rockets don't have a big man to guard  [So some teams have elected to defend him as if he were a center.  ](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/28763166/russell-westbrook-scores-34-points-being-guarded-rudy-gobert)   &gt;Yeah he's not physically a PG but also today isn't 1990.  Actually, in 1990 we had Magic Johnson, a 6'9 PG.  It's not about physicality or era. It's about the role you play on the team.    &gt;Simmons will stop being a PG just because somebody shorter starts next to him?  No, Simmons has been playing next to 3-4 guys shorter than him for years. Being classified as a guard isn't based on height, it's based on the role you play.   Case in point, just last season Simmons (6'10) was a guard while playing next to Redick (6'3), Butler (6'7) and Harris (6'8).   ***  &gt;What a fucking genius you are my man    Go to your own sub and ask them if Bam is a point guard.   Dumbass."
"It’s about making the right play. You wanna get the highest percentage shots you can out of possessions. Russell Westbrook chucking up contested jumpers ain’t it, which is why he’s commonly used as the example from his OKC days."
"Worst :  Cj McCollum will become better than Dame.  OKC should trade Russell Westbrook for Rajon Rondo  Nurkic &gt; Jokic  Dirk Nowitzki is soft  Rodney Stuckey will become a star  Jeremy Lamb is a better prospect than Brad Beal  Rodney Hood will become a star  &amp;#x200B;  Good :  I hate Andrew Wiggins as a prospect  I'd draft Tatum and Isaac before Lonzo  Derrick Williams will not  be good  MCW rookie of the year campain means nothing  Chris Paul is way better than Deron Williams  Kyle Lowry is way better than Aaron Brooks  &amp;#x200B;  Just a few examples, I'd say the good ones were way more obvious and the bad ones really really really dummmmmb"
"as long as you're also not Andrew Wiggins, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, John Wall, Steph Curry"
"Seriously -- James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving and LeBron James always get let off the hook on this forum."
Houston vs Boston. Houston wins the series 4-3. Russell Westbrook wins Finals MVP.
"In hindsight, 2014-15 was pretty thick with good teams. There were 7 50-win teams in the West and 3 in the East, with the Raptors just barely missing the cut at 49 wins. Two teams won 60+ games and set franchise win records - the Hawks and the Warriors. The Hawks managed to sneak in a record 4 players plus their coach onto the All-Star team. The Grit and Grind Grizzlies had their best season to date, while the Rockets got the closest they've been to the Finals since Jordan left the league. Lob City was still at its peak.  Older players such as Kobe, Dirk, Tim Duncan, DWade, Pau Gasol, and Carmelo were all selected for the All-Star game. But the West was rotten with current and future MVPs, such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Steph Curry. Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, Chris Bosh, and Blake Griffin also deserve a shout-out. The rest of the list contains stalwarts such as Dame, Klay, Lowry, LaMarcus Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, and Marc Gasol."
"The Rockets and Heat are both very good teams right now and in a position where either of them could win a championship but it’s unlikely. I think they would both be fun teams to root for.   West vs East isn’t terribly important. It’s just a way the league is divided to sort the playoffs and scheduling. The Western Conference has typically been better than the East overall  With D Wade being your favorite basketball player, I’d think you’d enjoy watching Russell Westbrook on the Rockets or Jimmy Butler on the Heat"
My two cents:  1. LeBron James 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. James Harden 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Luka Doncic 6. Anthony Davis 7. Damian Lillard 8. Joel Embiid 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Paul George 11. Pascal Siakam 12. Russell Westbrook 13. Ben Simmons 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Jimmy Butler 16. Donovan Mitchell 17. Chris Paul 18. Kemba Walker 19. Rudy Gobert 20. Hassan Whiteside
Russell Westbrook is probably very dedicated to his home network storage machine.
"I didn't say we should be ""ignoring the impacts of race"". I said we should be getting away from viewing people as a part of a collective group that oppresses/is oppressed. Of course your race/gender/socioeconomic context affects how your life turns out, or at least where you start, but the most important factor, and truly the only one that matters is you, the individual. Is a poor, uneducated, white male coal miner in west Virginia part of the oppressor group of white males? Is Russell Westbrook part of the oppressed group of black men?   I think most people backing BLM, social activism, anti-racism, etc. are noble in intention, but you have to be able to seperate it from the marxist ideology that is infiltrating and taking over those movements. When you follow collectivist ideology to it's logical conclusion, you get Dekulakization and Holocausts."
10. Russell Westbrook  9. Joel Embiid  8. Damian Lillard  7. Anthony Davis  6. Nikola Jokic  5. Luka Doncic  4. Kawhi Leonard  3. James Harden  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  1. LeBron James
"One for himself, one for his huge balls and one for his son Russell Westbrook."
fuck KD god bless us all on this Russell Westbrook day
Russell Westbrook would speed off. Why not?
"You are conflating 2 things, analytics and small ball.  Milwaukee uses analytics, but they certainly aren't ""small"".  Analytics are here to stay, but there are different faces for it and teams will build around the strengths of their personnel (and likely what the analytics say works best for those star players).  Very few stars have the need for 5-out spacing that Russell Westbrook has, but for those that do, small-ball could be an answer.  It depends a bit on if your main star is better at driving or posting up."

Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook, Jerry West, Dominique Wilkins, Rasheed Wallace, Bill Walton"
D'Angelo Russell Westbrook would be an amazing point guard to build around  Edit:   Donovan Mitchell Robinson would be unstoppable  Carmelo Anthony Davis Bertans is the ultimate stretch 4
Like who hates Russell Westbrook lmao. Plays hard every game. Never really ended another teams run. Doesn’t flop. Would have stayed in fucking Oklahoma his whole career if OKC wanted to.  By the rules you use to hate on players he violates practically none.
I've always thought D'Angelo Russell Westbrook is pretty much Damian Lillard lol
Bill Russell Westbrook
Bill Russell Westbrook or Michael Jordan Clarkson  Honorable mention Julius Ervin(g) Johnson
Bill Russell Westbrook would give LB James Harden a run
D'Angelo Russell Westbrook Lopez
"I just don't get where people are getting the Rockets hype from.  I can buy them being the 3rd best team in the west, no one but the top two are that great. But people really think you can beat Lebron+AD or Giannis with the biggest guy on the floor being PJ Tucker?  And they believe this because they have top tier playoff performers James Harden and Russell Westbrook?  This team is just flat worse than the past Rockets."
"James Harden is breastfeeding Russell Westbrook, the Rockets are trying to hide this from us. Russ is gonna average a quadruple double from the extra electrolytes he’s getting from Harden’s titty"
"Yea but why does this affect him and not other elite college players who come in?  I don't recall John Wall, Russell Westbrook etc seeing a big decline in ft% upon entering the NBA, in fact many players even improved like Griffin because they have all the time to work with trainers.  I see the point, but I don't think its 100% the worn out argument"
"Got your facts wrong. Presti did nothing to push KD away. KD was telling Nick Collison and Russell Westbrook he was going to re-sign, and then left anyways.   The only reason KD called us toxic was because we didn’t show him love (I guess he was expecting?) after he left us high and dry to join the rival. It was insane for him to think he would be received well on his return or that the basketball world wouldn’t call him out for his decision."
I mean... The Houston Rockets can't get to the finals and Russell Westbrook cannot get passed the 1st round so what does it even matter?
"I think that is a oversimplification of my point. Presti has a number of failings, such as the Sonics trades and the Harden trade. He also has not done well at retaining superstar talent such as Ray Allen, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, or Paul George. But in his favor, he has made excellent trades in recent years. And OKC has been stellar in its draft selection.  You're right that if you ignore all his failings, he's great. But you're missing the point that even if you include all his failings, he's still a pretty good GM - good enough to be top 10."
He didn't mention partying in Vegas  [https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/russell-westbrook-partied-at-wynn-before-covid-diagnosis-2073145/](https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/russell-westbrook-partied-at-wynn-before-covid-diagnosis-2073145/)
"Let me make the case for you to root for the Houston Rockets. We have a solid color scheme in Red, Black with the occasional Mustard Yellow. It's easy to buy a jersey because our premier player Harden is pretty satisfied with the team, a perennial all star, future hall of famer, and our jerseys objectively are top 12 in the league. Otherwise, our other premier player in Russell Westbrook is also an easy choice. The great thing about the team is that we have Westbrook in that he will give you 110% of his energy each game should you stay up/wake up early to catch a live game. He is by far the most exciting player with the most heart in the league.  This is the best time to support us as we're currently built to win now, so your first few years will be exciting to watch. The Rockets play efficient and fast basketball. We live and die by the three, and our 7 second offense. I'm not going to sugarcoat, there will be times you will want to jump ship, but given time you'll see Harden/Westbrook light it up like no other in the league.  Assuming you know of the Premier League, I liken the Rockets to the Tottenham Spurs. We've got one of the best coaches/manager duos in the game in D'antoni and Morey just as the Spurs have Mourinho. We both had great success back in the day. We've got a stud duo in the likes of James Harden, and Russell Westbrook who I see as an equivalent to Son Heungmin and Harry Kane. We also both struggled heavily during the mid 00's.  Overall, we've got a solid presence in r/nba, and we have an amazing culture over at r/rockets.  Houston itself, is considered mid to large market. From my own personal observations, we've held the ""villain"" reputation as opposed to the golden child of the Warriors/Giannis. People often will misunderstand the greatness of Harden and how he changed the game with his move, the stepback. Be prepared to look beyond the occasional exotic dancer, and dare to appreciate one of the greatest offensive players to ever play the game of basketball."
"Since you’re from UK the Raptors May be a good choice. They have a player from London, and are a team no one really bandwagons but a very good team.  Personal note.. you should watch the Rockets. Yes they aren’t a “small” team, but they are a contender who play a unique stay of basketball called “Small Ball” with no player being taller than 6’7 and shooting lots of 3’s.  Also James Harden &amp; Russell Westbrook are beasts.  Check out the highlights from this game from this season, see if you like it!   https://youtu.be/y3IS1JtHNVA"
"One of them is Russell Westbrook, no?"
From an interview he gave a few years ago   https://www.si.com/nba/2017/04/26/patrick-beverley-postgame-comments-russell-westbrook-thunder-rockets
Best wishes to Russell Westbrook and Thunder Fans.  This sucks.
Top 10 ranking of players that have had Covid 1. Russell Westbrook 2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Rudy Gobert ...
"NBA ALL-COVID TEAM:  Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert.   Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Marcus Smart, Christian Wood, DeAndre Jordan.   Spencer Dinwiddie, Buddy Hield, Landry Shamet, Derrick Jones Jr, Thomas Bryant."
"Did you read it? Because I did. Does not prove your claim right.  That’s the problem huh! I did google your claim already! I couldn’t find anything that proved you right.  Just to be clear, here’s the relevant bit of the article:  &gt;	Now, a study out of the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego backs up what Dr. Lovecchio is seeing first hand. The study found that on the Diamond Princess cruise ship earlier this year where there was a COVID outbreak, more than half of the 76 asymptomatic people infected on board now show significant lung abnormalities that weren't immediately apparent.  Russell Westbrook is not some old person on a cruise. No specifics on “abnormalities”. Sample size of 76! Let’s spread fear guys! Westbrook and Harden might have to retire!"
"Landry Shamet of the Clippers was tested positive before the camp started, isn't he allowed to join in a few weeks after he gets well? Same situation for Russell Westbrook now?"
Russell westbrook is on the rockets?
"I get that and have to respect it. They’re adults who are capable of making their own decisions. I just really hope it doesn’t turn out bad for anybody. Just heard Russell Westbrook tested positive. I wouldn’t want to see an entire team get infected during the season. I wonder how the league would even handle that if it did happen.  The one thing that does absolutely annoy me about this is that they will be getting tested on a weekly basis and results will come back within the day after testing for the athletes, whereas the general public in Florida don’t get their results about 5-7 days after testing. It’s a shame we prioritize athletes over the general public. Maybe Bioreference will start providing extra testing to the general public as well."
No but it has something to do with Russell Westbrook playing basketball a year or 2 from now
Most healthy asymptomatic people aren’t having lung problems a month after testing positive.  Obviously no one knows the long term effects but “I saw this thing about a person having an issue from covid 19” isn’t helpful either because those cases almost have nothing to do if Russell Westbrook can play basketball a month from now
"&gt;He's not at the bubble yet right?  No, Russell Westbrook along with James Harden didn't travel with the Houston Rockets to the bubble in Orlando. I reckon that Russell Westbrook got COVID-19 probably a week ago or so when people started speculating that he contracted the coronavirus, so he's probably been quarantining for a while now. I don't know if James Harden tested positive for COVID-19, but I'm going to assume that he might've tested positive for COVID-19 as well and is quarantining right now since he's not in the bubble in Orlando lol"
Russell Westbrook tests positive for Covid-19 https://twitter.com/fantasylabsnba/status/1282719523896991744?s=21  Edit: also confirmed via personal Twitter Pretty big blow for the rockets depending on how long he takes to recover
"The MVP is already heavily influenced by the best offensive season. It's basically OPOY + Team Record. And the better one side of the equation is, the lesser the other side can be (see Steve Nash v. Russell Westbrook)  So i don't think it would add much value."
Russell Westbrook! 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
"The same list that has Ja Morant 2 spots below Donovan Mitchell, Khris Middleton at #10, and Russell Westbrook at #22."
"&gt;he anchors a top 3 defense in the NBA  no he isn't. [Giannis is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQgnY-ZA9tg)  &gt;defends the paint as well as almost anyone  that's not true. he defends the paint so well because he gives the perimeter player so much room and relies A LOT on the help defense, which is according to MIL's plan. take away MIL's brilliant defensive schemes, and Brook isn't elite.  &gt;You combine that defense with the fact that he can shoot from the perimeter  he's shooting Russell Westbrook %'s this season.  &gt;still has a top notch low post game?  i don't recall him really using that much anymore.  &gt;is Goberts defense so much better than Lopezs  [yes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93fx0ZDLAQ) look at the team's defensive ratings with them on/off.  &gt;offsets everything else that Lopez provides on offense?  i'm not even sure Brook is the superior offensive player anymore. Gobert scores more per possession / per game, and has the much higher TS%  &gt; Absolutely not, and anybody that disagrees is lying to themselves.   or it's just that we know better"
"It's not about being better, it's about having style. It's like preferring Shaun Livingston over Russell Westbrook. Just subjectively comparing swagger."
"I find the term ""best"" so useless in these discussions. The vast majority of NBA fans consider Russell Westbrook to be elite at his position and a top 10 player in the league.  Now Westbrook is obviously one of the most athletic players in the league, but who contributes more to winning? Who is more valuable to their team?  My only point is that the term ""best"" is useless."
"I want to hear Pat Bev, Joel Embiid and Russell Westbrook talk some shit loud and clear."
"Jesus christ, they put Chris Paul (13) and Kyle Lowry (20) ahead of Westbrook (23). Like, I know numbers aren't everything but Paul is averaging 18, 5, 7, on 49% fg whereas Russell is averaging 28, 8, 7, on 47% fg.  There should be no way that CP3 is 10 spots ahead of Westbrook."
What do you mean nobody knows what throws Bledsoe off?   He thinks he’s some godlike combination of Russell Westbrook and Kyrie Irving but he’s only like 30% of each.  Then once he knows he’s fucking up he becomes so self conscious and passive.  It gets pretty cringy to watch at a point cause he always talks shit in his interviews too but never back it up when it counts
Scottie Pippen and Russell Westbrook are not getting any love as well.
PG: John Houston Stockton  SG: George Gervin  SF: Julius Winfield Erving II  PF: Dirk Werner Nowitzki  C: Westley Sissel Unseld  Honorable Mentions:  * Russell Westbrook III * Robert Joseph Cousy * Willis Reed Jr.  * Robert E. Lee Pettit Jr.
Swap Joel Embiid and Russell Westbrook. Seeing Russ have to deal with Ben and Joel with Harden would be pure comedy
"Let me catch you to speed on the landscape: - OKC had 3 pre-MVP winners on one team - Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden. - Kevin Durant left OKC to go to the Warriors, the year after the broke the bulls regular season record, with 70 wins. - the Warriors have the two best shooters of all time still: Steph Curry and Klay Thompson - Lebron couldn't quite win a championship with Cleveland. He then went to Miami (look up ""the decision"") and won 2 of 4 years with dwade. - Lebron went back to Cleveland and carried his team on his back to the finals every year, even after Kyrie left (there was a great SNL sketch at the about the other Caviliers). But they still won 1 with Kyrie. - Kyrie is uncle Drew - Kyrie and Kevin Durant are now with the nets, validating the other New York team, and they are known as the whiniesy players in the NBA. - the Knicks owner is a joke. - the Toronto Raptors traded a star player (sorta) for one year with Kawaii Leonard, and they won last year. - Kawaii and Paul George are now on a super team LA Clippers. - LA now has two super teams, now the Lakers have Lebron and Anthony Davis - the last two years have been the greatest draft years ever - two years ago Luka and Trae Young were drafted 6 &amp; 7 and model their games to be the next Lebron and Steph - this year we got Zion and Ja Morant. Zion needs no introduction, but Ja Morant was an awesome surprise who is athletic, drops dime passes, and has Russell Westbrook energy - Portland Trailblazers have Damian Lillard and CJ, who are great, but will never ever make the finals it seems - the Greek Freek is Giannis, and he IS the bucks (they have good role players) - San Antonio dynasty is over - Boston and Miami have great young teams that will be great if kept together - Philly could be great... But see Portland - DC sucks but John Wall has been out two years and Bradley Beal turned into Allen Iverson suddenly - Houston Rockets didn't work with James Harden and Chris Paul. People thought Paul was washed up and he went to OKC (after Russ and PG left) and they've been winning a bunch, reminding us he's one of the best point guards ever - now Rockets have Harden and Westbrook, which was awkward at first cuz they made Russ shoot 3s, and he can't... Then they got rid of their center to open the floor (small ball 2.0) and they clicked. - the rockets coach, Mike Diantoni will likely get fired if they yet again don't win/make finals, for his unconventional ways, but it's statically the best offensive style. - Denver Nuggets have an amazing center who stays far for no reason  Did I miss anything?"
"Probably this year but 2014 deserves a mention with Kobe, D-Rose, and to a lesser extent Russell Westbrook (even though he did play 46 games)."
"Despite being 6% of the Thunder, Russell Westbrook is responsible for 20% of the teams rebounds."
Russell Westbrook
"This.   I agree with the comments that Harden is a superior player than the others listed but the talent surrounding him in terms of ability and fit has been far superior to what any of the others have had.   Morey has tried like crazy to get the right pieces surrounding Harden.   None of the others listed have had second stars as good as Dwight Howard (tail of prime), Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook.   Then take it one step further, when you have that kind of star power for players 1 (Harden) and 2 (insert side kick), the PJ Tucker’s, Trevor Arizas (when with Houston), Eric Gordons, Robert Covingtons, Clint Capelas, Pat Beverlys, Lou Williams, Montrez Harrells, Corey Brewers, etc are that much more effective.   I could go on and on but if you go to their [BBall Ref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/2016.html) page and just scroll through the rosters they’ve had since Harden got there, they have had A LOT of good basketball players come through there.   The winning they’ve experienced is a tribute to both Harden and Morey."
"What's crazy is that if you take LeBron's worst box scores from any year (excluding rookie season), it's still a ridiculously good player.  **25.3 - 7.4 - 6.0 - 1.2 - 0.3**  Only 5 players in history have achieved this average pts/reb/ast/stl box score or higher in a season since 1973:  Michael Jordan (1), James Harden (1), Russell Westbrook (3), Larry Bird (4), and LeBron James (10).  Removing the '1.2 steals' requirement, we only add three more players: Luka Doncic (1), John Havlicek (2), and Oscar Robertson (6)."
"No, like how Russell Westbrook turned Victor Oladipo into a spot-up shooter."
" To add insult to injury, today is Russell Westbrook Day."
"Russell Westbrook would more likely say ""LA this is for you."""
Or Russell Westbrook
"Thanks, man. I know, it IS incredible how underrated the starting C for the #3 seed in the East is and how overrated Russ (on the underachieving #6 seed in the West) is. Remember last year, when Harden and the Rockets were the #4 seed in the West *without* Russ?

"You have the likes of Mitchell Robinson, Hassan Whiteside, and DANIEL FUCKING THEIS on the HM, and Russell Westbrook doesn’t even get one. Incredible stuff."
Russell “Irish Spring Green Green” Westbrook
Joel will no doubt shank Russell Westbrook with the scraps.   Totally worth it.
"Russell Westbrook. Nobody that inefficient should ever shoot that much, particularly when you've had Kevin Durant and James Harden for teammates. That makes it doubly offensive.  We gave Iverson shit for shooting so much, so inefficiently, and he actually had little to pass to."
Russell Westbrook was put at 7 in the PG list. Thats all you really need to know...
UNPOPULAR OPINION: RUSSELL WESTBROOK &gt; KD
"A lot of them aren't, it's just that Shane Battier or Russell Westbrook aren't going to make headlines like Kyrie Irving or the guy suspended in Miami."
I mean he very clearly stated it was for that one single day in 2018. Now Russell Westbrook on the other hand....the mayor declared EVERY day is Russell Westbrook day. So happy fucking Russell Westbrook day from OKC.
"Yeah, it's really a matter of how much a player has the ball. If you're PJ Tucker and you're playing with James Harden and Russell Westbrook, your defense matters way more because it's not like you'll have a ton to do on offense, so it's way more important to be great defensively."
Happy Russell Westbrook day
"Clearly the answer is Russell Westbrook, man."
Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook.

"i don't even understand the winning argument for lowry. russell westbrook as the second best player went to 4 western conference finals and 1 final in the blood bath of a west. lowry as a second best player in the weak east went to 2 eastern conference finals and 1 ring. westbrook just had some horrendous luck come playoff time and never had the same break that kyle lowry had last year. say it for what it is, no one would be calling lowry a winning player had kawhi not come along last year."
"Much better shot than now, in 5 years guys like LeBron, Durant, Kawhi, Steph, etc will be out of the top player rankings. Simmons will be competing with the likes of Luka, Giannis, Tatum, Trae, Zion, etc. For him to be a top 5 player, he *must* either become a driving terror like Giannis or start implementing shooting into his game.   He needs to be a solid mid range shooter and at least 30% three point shooter to elevate to that status. Who is the last perimeter guard to be a top 5 player with a shaky shot or no 3? Russell Westbrook, and even with Russ, in his prime he could light you up from the mid range and was a 35% three point shooter on 7 attempts. If Simmons unlocks even that, he’ll be top 5."
"Michael Jordan is the player I want Russell Westbrook to become.   Wilt Chamberlain is the player I want James harden to be, while keeping his 3 pointer.    I think I’m doing this right."
Russell Westbrook is the player I wanted Marcus Smart to be when he was drafted in 2013
"No matter who wins, in 2-5 years time people will say “that banner doesn’t count because it was the Covid season.”  It might not even take that long for that just to be popular opinion. We haven’t even really processed how the bubble will effect games.   Actual basketball take: James Harden and Russell Westbrook will be elevated up a level and will shed their “can’t play in the playoffs” moniker. Or they’ll be super out of shape and never catch momentum because their ownership is cheap. One or the other."
I wonder who his other 1-2 favorite players were. I had a joke where I’d pick two nba players both named either Jerry or West but the closest I found playing in 2017 were JERRYd Bayless and Russell WESTbrook.
"We've got a little bit of a parallel here OP, I'm a Jazz fan whose favorite non-Jazz player is probably Russell Westbrook. I doubt many other Jazz fans agree, especially now that he's on the Rockets, but I've always liked his game and his energy and athleticism make him exciting to watch.   It wasn't long ago that people thought nobody would ever average a triple double again and Westbrook did it 3 seasons in a row. That's impressive no matter how much the haters want to cry about stat padding"
"His team is number 1 offense in the league and the best offense of all time. However even when he is off the court his teams offense rating is top 10 in the league (tied with Jazz for number 8) and actually ranked higher than any offense in the league from the year 2010-2015...   Top 5 bench in the league per net rating. If he had the terrible benches that Trae Young, Devin Booker, or Lillard (this year) has had to deal with he would be well out of the playoffs just like those players are this year. How is turning a top 5 bench in the LEAGUE to a 7th seed in the WEST carrying?  His USG% as a sophomore jumped a significant amount compared to when he was a rookie. However even as a ROOKIE his USG% is higher than any year of John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, and Chris Paul.  He puts up gawdy volume stats since he has the ball in his hands a lot and he accumulates Russell Westbrook type uncontested rebounds (which have zero correlation with winning) and people see these stats and overrate him. What is worse is a lot of these ""advanced stats"" are just formulas based on peoples box scores leading people to overrating him even more because people say he is good according to ""multiple advanced stats"" when formulas often give credit on defense for getting rebounds and such.  Below average FT% and 3% both years he has been in the league. His high volume isn't a good enough excuse because even among high volume shooters his % sticks out.   He is a stat stuffer and so overrated. People say Dallas has the best core in the league just because of him, compare him to Lebron James and Michael Jordan, even saw a comparison to Aang in Avatar lol."

"Kyrie Irving, Paul George, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis. Kyle Lowry is not on their level in terms of talent, but his hairline is nice too."
"Jameis Winston threw for over 5k yards last season and got replaced while Joe Montana has never even thrown for 4k yards and he is considered a GOAT. Just in the last 5 years the NBA has changed so much with how much PG's get the ball in their hands and get to rack up stats on top of the Russell Westbrook type high volume of uncontested rebounds.  Get this.. Luka's USG% jumped a huge amount from a rookie to a sophomore but even as a ROOKIE he had a higher USG% than any year of Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Jason Kidd, and Isiah Thomas.  Similarly the team with the number 1 ranked offense in the 2014-15 season is 111.6 and that would rank outside of the top 10 this year at number 12... replacing the Phoenix Suns.  All this is without even factoring in the defensive side of the ball..."
"During last year’s trade negotiations...   ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reports:  Had Presti been able to strike a deal for George with the Raptors — and Leonard was willing to stay — George was believed to be willing to join the Raptors too, sources said. Presti pursued a package of Russell Westbrook with George to the Raptors — with the NBA’s Most Improved Player, forward Pascal Siakam as the centerpiece of a deal — and Ujiri balked, league sources said."
"That was the caveat during the trade though.  Kawhi would’ve stayed, if Toronto traded Pascal for Paul and Russell Westbrook.  Masai didn’t want to give up Pascal...but then could you imagine Kawhi, PG and Westbrook on the raps this year?  Even with pandemic P, Westbrook gives his 100%  on the court.  It would’ve been an easy championship win this year.   https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/report-thunder-offered-raptors-westbrook-george-trade-siakam/"
"Russell Westbrook gained new respect for Luka Doncic tonight, seeing Luka come back in with an injury to pad the stat sheet and get the triple double"
"As a Raptors fan, I love the enthusiasm but I don't think both Fred and Kyle belong in the top 5. I can see the argument for Kyle and Fred is a good defender considering his size, but I think Jrue, Ben Simmons, Klay, CP3, Jimmy Butler/Jaylen Brown (if we consider them as guards), Victor Oladipo (when healthy), and Marcus Smart should be considered for the top 5 as well. I'm not sure what the defensive numbers say about Malcolm Brogdon, Russell Westbrook, and Eric Bledsoe but I think they might warrant consideration too.  edit: too many words"
"Raps will finish the sweep here, beat the celtics in 6 due to depth and Hayward being out and proceed to beat the Bucks in 6 due to being out coached / Giannis having troubles getting his 3 going and paint scoring due to focus.   Bud will be replaced or there will be a major change in the org to keep Giannis.  They will proceed to meet James Harden and  Russell Westbrook in the NBA finals after a lack of shooting catches up to the Lakers and a lack of consistency from Paul George and lingering Injury hampers Pbev.  Raptors in 7 to win the championship."
&gt;DeMar DeFrozen  Wtf is this Skip's account?  &gt;I can’t think of a more useless star. Closest would probably be Russell Westbrook at this point?  Are you just a troll trying to make Bucks fans look bad?
Some even argued top 10. Just a few weeks ago I was being told Middleton is better than Russell Westbrook
"Houston. I wanna see Russell Westbrook, mostly, and James Harden do well"
"Ehh I mean I’m not gonna say she’s a bad interviewer, because she does seem to have great chemistry with the players she talks to in her 1 on 1 sit down interviews, and does a good job of getting them to be loose and comfortable...but the particular question from this clip is a super boilerplate snoozefest press conference question.   If Barry trammel asked Russell Westbrook why he was so happy and what about this environment let’s him thrive, he’d get totally roasted on here and I don’t think very many people would suggest that kind of question should put him in the tier of being the best interviewer in the league.   I don’t wanna be toooo cynical here and get accused of being an incel basement dwelling woman hater but tbh I think a big part of the reason she has been so successful is because she incredibly attractive, charismatic and flirty while still keeping a baseline of professionalism and the dudes she’s talking to would happily talk to her all day long... it’s not necessarily because she asks super deep, researched, journalistically hard hitting questions. The players are already drooling all over themselves and ready to spill their guts before the interview has even started half the time.  Which makes for grest content by the way, so more power to her"
Would have been even more interesting to see Russell Westbrook with Jimmy on the Heat if that trade hadn’t fallen through
"Russell ""Marisha Ray"" Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook as a head coach is not a thing I knew I needed until today.
The fact that Harden can have a very bad game and the Rockets still win is a good sign for their championship hopes.  Also Jeff Green &gt; Russell Westbrook.
Once again the only thing that can save okc is Russell Westbrook
"I know we're trying to say there's no superteams this year but what else do I call a team with James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Austin Rivers on it?"
Russell Westbrook
"Oh man it was gold. Watching a rookie Donovan Mitchell, Joe Ingles, and Rudy Gobert  beat Paul George, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony might be my favorite Jazz series of all time. Maybe even better that going to the finals in the Stockton and Malone days."
This is disrespectful to Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook shoots 80% from the free throw line but no one would say he is a good shooter and better than LeBron.. Free  throws are an entirely different beast than 3pt shooting.
"I am in no way saying he's as good as Russell Westbrook, but when Norm gets a full head of steam and when he leaps full force into a dunk it reminds me of Westbrook.  Even his form on his jumpshots."
"They're the only team in the west that's contender status (if James Harden and Russell Westbrook can be instant contenders, so can Steph/Klay/Dray)  &amp;#x200B;  A.) They have a really high draft pick  B.) They have another year with a good coaching staff at solving Andrew Wiggins"
"Well we got some fringe guys that come down to a matter of opinion:  1. Russell Westbrook  2. Kyrie Irving  3. Joel Embiid  4. Jimmy Butler  5. Paul George  6. Chris Paul  7. Ben Simmons  8. Jayson Tatum  I don’t think most of these guys are better than AD, but the case could certainly be made for a couple of them."
"this is so fucking disrespectful to russ  &gt;	In a similar way, Russell Westbrook has never been the best player on his own team, serving as an ideal sidekick to multiple NBA stars during his career.  who was he the sidekick to in 16-17? Oladipo? Adams?  and i’d say he was better than PG in 17-18 but PG was better in 18-19 but that at least is debatable"
"Don't bother, people here are fucking idiots who run with things just because a popular player said it. Anyone who knows what they're talking about knows that Patrick Beverley is a great role player. It's hilarious how all it takes is a salty quote from Russell fucking Westbrook (who it took over 10 years to figure out that he shouldn't shoot threes) for all the morons to act like Beverley is a scrub."
Russell Westbrook; He tricked yall man. Patrick Beverly sitting down and doing nothing.
"Yeah, Russell Westbrook and his 5 WCF finals appearances apparently clearly ALWAYS fucks his team."

"I was in Guantanamo Bay for 10 years just came out today but I heard that Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook were on the same team at one point. Did they win 5 championships together before moving teams?"
Exactly what I was thinking. That trade was made specifically for Russell Westbrook’s sake. Whether  Covington trade was worth it or not rests solely on how Westbrook plays this playoffs. If he’s bad that trade AND the CP3 trade look worse to me. If Russ dominates then it becomes 1000% justified because the Rockets ceiling is higher than it was without Covington.
The GOAT is back. That Russell Westbrook jigg had me dead.
"Dude by all accounts Wilt was a bad playoff player and leader. He didn’t win until he became more of a team player, just like Russell. This is according to players of that era, not me. Those points outweigh any statistical advantage, because if only one player is controlling the offense a team can’t win that way. Read the book of basketball. Sometimes intangible benefits kill the impact of the tangible benefits. If we only lived by stats people would think Westbrook was the best player of the 2010s. Wilt was a beast, but he didn’t understand that he alone could not win when he had at least 3 other hall of gamers on his team at all times."
"Only because [Westbrook](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/umleruiozspnj0y1q3ri/sixers-fan-flips-off-russell-westbrook) is out"

"&gt;Top 10 in no particular order: Lebron, kd, kawhi, giannis, AD, harden, steph, Luka, Paul George, then either Russell Westbrook or Damian lillard.  If you're counting injured players its borderline, but I would take Jimmy Butler over Westbrook on any list in 2020."
"Paul George is definitely better than jimmy butler and still probably isn’t a super star. Maybe he’s borderline. Jimmy butler is definitely not a top 10 player if we’re counting players who are currently injured.   Top 10 in no particular order: Lebron, kd, kawhi, giannis, AD, harden, steph, Luka, Paul George, then either Russell Westbrook or Damian lillard.  That’s 11 players probably better than butler. There’s a bunch more debatable ones, for example embiid, jokic, Chris Paul and probably a few others"
"Steph Curry, Damien Lillard, Kylie Irving, Russell Westbrook, CP3, Kemba Walker, Kyle Lowry, DeAaron Fox.  Id have Simmons in 8-10 range personally."
I kinda think they have to tho. Seriously. You can't have big (primarily Black) dudes fighting every other game and incurring additional damage to their bodies. They'd be no better than the NFL and it feels like every year people question the damage done in NFL.  The KP tech was soft but you really don't want these dudes slamming Russell Westbrook down from out the air so he doesn't get a dunk. Like...that's just trash.

"Russell has had a negative net rating in his last three playoff runs, three playoff runs in a row.. he has been terrible.   Compare that to Chris Pauls last three playoffs runs...  Which are arguable his 3 worst ever.  Chris Paul impacts winning so much more then Westbrook"
"Wow an actual impartial outlook of the game. Would the outcome have been different if KP was still there yes, but his P&amp;R defense was still poor and Clippers would have continued to expose it.  Dallas missed several shots as you mentioned but no way Dallas fans realize this because they were already crying corrupt from the 3rd. Luka was unguardable on the drive and Morris did extremely well to stay in front but the 10 turnovers was a glaring black eye in why Dallas lost. No credit for Kawhi making tough shot after tough shot, along with Bevs offensive rebounds and big time defense, plus Paul George being Paul George.   People will criticize Russell Westbrook for his high turnover rate but Luka gets a pass? This sub is just so damn toxic towards Clippers, it’s hilarious."
Doing his best Russell Westbrook impression
lmao 40 seconds left and Embiid is *walking* down the court  he needs to get a little more fight in him. maybe they could ask Russell Westbrook to come jeer him from the sidelines? might get him pumped

James Harden	25.16   And here's the top 10 most scoring titles:  &gt;  1.	Michael Jordan 10x  2. Wilt Chamberlain 7x 3. Kevin Durant 4x 3. George Gervin 4x 3. Allen Iverson 3x 6. James Harden 3x 6. Neil Johnston 3x 6. Bob McAdoo 3x 6. George Mikan.  10. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 2x 10. Kobe Bryant 2x 10. Adrian Dantley 2x  10. Tracy McGrady 2x 10. Bob Petit 2x 10. Russell Westbrook 2x   So anyone's top.10 should look pretty close.to these 2 lists. I guess Bob Petit was also quite the scorer, but 1950s is a bit too much of a reach."

**I HEARD THE ROCKETS HAD A WAY TO CHEAT BY BANGING ON A TRASH CAN JUST LIKE THE ASTROS. TOO BAD RUSSELL WESTBROOK COULDN'T TAKE ALL THE ABUSE**
WILL RUSSELL WESTBROOK MAKE IT OUT OF THE FIRST ROUND
"If Russell Westbrook misses the series, then Houston still has the best player in the series, but you could argue that the Thunder have the next best five players in Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari, Dennis Schroder and Steven Adams."
"There's literally different levels of fandom man, get used to it. Also I love Russell Westbrook himself more than Luka FOR NOW, but it's not a stretch that I hate the decision-making sometimes of Russ and it just kills me before but rn it just lessened since Harden, which I used to not appreciate, is getting the ball more than him and I just realized how special and transcendent of a player than bad man with a beard is."

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2018/12/06/russell-westbrook-thunder-billy-donovan-paul-george-dennis-schroder Y’all really want that narrative huh
He's going to grow into a combo of Russell Westbrook and Tony Parker.  It's gonna be scary.
"What an accomplishment.  Seriously, you call people trolls for having an opinion? That's lame.  James Harden is shockingly #3 in the league in shot attempts. I expected him to be #1. Of the top 10, he has the 2nd lowest shooting percentage (Trae Young is the lowest). Of the top 20 shot attempts only D'angelo Russell and Trae Young have a lower shooting percentage...Russell Westbrook is #2 in the league in shots.  Obviously James Harden has the most 3 point shot attempts per game (12.4) but in shooting percentage he is ranked #102.  You can put any analytical spin you want on it. You have 2 guys taking all the shots for a team. One of the guys, the guy who leads the league in scoring bombs 3's all game long and doesn't have the greatest shooting percentage doing so.  Let's see how this style of ball works out in the playoffs. I mean if getting there is some sort of accomplishment, then congrats to James Harden on all of his stats. If winning the championship is the goal, it isn't going to happen."
"This is the correct answer. I can think of 5 major reasons off the top of my head of why Luka is overrated.  1) Luka's USG% jumped an insane amount from his rookie to sophomore year. However even as a ROOKIE he had a higher USG% than any year of Chris Paul, John Stockton, Steve Nash, Magic Johnson, etc etc. He puts up insane volume stats that wow people.  2) He gets a high amount of uncontested rebounds westbrook style which further contributes to him getting a high amount of volume stats. There is zero correlation between guard rebounding and winning. A lot of ""advanced stats"" are just a formula that factor in many things including rebounds so he gets a huge boost and he gets rated really high (remember when Russell Westbrook had the best season of all time his MVP year according to BPM and they had to adjust the formula?). Many of these same advanced stats underrate players like Klay Thompson and Dennis Rodman (even the 2 years he won DMVP he had poor defensive advanced stats) but also overrate players like Westbrook, Hassan Whiteside, and Luka.  3) So he has a huge amount of volume stats and a huge USG%. That means his team depends on him right? Wrong, he has [very mediocre on/off numbers](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) and superstar ""mvp"" caliber seasons usually have insane on/off like at least 5+ but many 10+ per 100 possessions.  4) People often look at the best 2 or 3 players on a team to judge how much help they have. For example people say ""Lebron has AD"" etc and Porzingis is a good number 2 but people look at how Mavs third best player is maybe THJ and he isn't a good third best player so they automatically think his team isn't that good. However, the Mavs are an excellent team that is very deep and their 4th-8th best players are among the best 4-8th best players on a team in the league and are excellently coached. They are the right type of players that play the game right and win games and Mavs even have a top 5 bench in the league per net rating. No team has ever had a bench with a net rating as good as the Mavs have had and only finished 7th in the conference, they should have finished much higher.   5) He has been below average at 3% and ft% two years in a row now but he gets compared to Larry Bird for some reason. He isn't a Steph Curry or Steve Nash level offensive player and he also isn't an excellent two way player like Kawhi or Giannis.  I am not talking about projection, there are some people already saying he is an MVP type player or that he is as good as Lebron was when he was the same age and nether are the case.  One counter people will give is that the Mavs are the number 1 offense of all time. However they fail to look that even without Luka the Mavs have a top 10 offense in the NBA that would have been the number 1 ranked offense any year from 2010-2015. This is an unheard of good rating for a team and look up how bad the offensive ratings the Wizards are without Beal, the Trailblazers are without Lillard, the Suns are without Booker etc. Luka should get credit for turning a top 10 offense into a number 1 offense but people are giving him credit as if he is turning their offense around more than these other players and this just isn't the case. Another thing is looking at the same city but a different sport the Dallas Cowboys had the best NFL offense of all time last year but that doesn't mean Dak Prescott is the best QB of all time or even last year and a QB has a bigger impact on a teams offense than a PG does. Luka is on a team that is top 2 in 3PM and top 10 in 3P% and that helps him just as much that he helps them."
"The thing is though, Russell Westbrook never gets tired"
Ja is going to be great if he ever becomes even an average three point shooter.  I'm thinking Russell Westbrook without all the dumb shots and inefficiency
Ja Morant’s peak is Russell Westbrook right?
"Based on their careers so far, I would say this is what the current HOF picture looks like for active players.  Among active players, I would say the locks are Lebron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Pau Gasol, Anthony Davis, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, Giannis Antekoumpo, and Luka Doncic.   Guys that will probably get in are Kevin Love, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Blake Griffin, Marc Gasol, and Derrick Rose.  Guys that might get in are Lamarcus Aldridge, Draymond Green, Kemba Walker, Andre Iguodala, and Joel Embiid.   There's quite a few other guys that are too early into their careers to make a judgment on, like Jayson Tatum, Ben Simmons, KAT, etc."
Russell Westbrook has been to the western conference finals 4 times out of the 9 times he’s been in the playoffs (and he got injured by Beverley in 2013 on route to another wcf and potential finals appearance). Get your shit takes out of here.
"Ok here goes. In no particular order.   MJ, Lebron, Kobe, Bird, Kareem, Shaq, Hakeem, Duncan, Malone, KD, Steph, Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Barkley, Julius Irving, Isiah Thomas, David Robinson, Magic Johnson, Ewing, Reggie Miller, Giannis, Mikan, Pippen, Stockton, Gerving, Nate Thurmond, Rick Barry, Dennis Rodman, Dwyane Wade and Bill Walton.  That is 30.  Honourable mentions are: Drexler, Robert Parish, Bill Cousy, Russell Westbrook, Arvydas Sabonis, Carmelo, Chris Paul."
"That's ok. All in one advanced stats are two things:   1. Notoriously poor  2. Situation dependent. Unlike on offence where a star player can be in any situation and create a big impact, if a player is in the right or wrong context on defence they can be valued very very differently. Harden is a positive on Rockets, but he would be less effective in almost any other defence.  -   DBPM has Harden at 20th in the league. It also has Donte DiVincenzo at 5th, and Jokic at 9th.   Behind him in order Marcus Smart, Mitchell Robinson, Joel Embiid, and Paul George.   The only other Rocket in the top 50 is Covington at 29. PJ Tucker is just below Hassan Whiteside and Montrezl Harrell. Russell Westbrook at 90 is just below Jaylen Brown.  DWS has Harden at 12th. Right below Sabonis, and just a little above Kawhi Leonard and Ben Simmons.   DRPM has Harden at 75th.   -  I don't see why I undersold his post defence? I said he was good at post defence and good on the switch.   -  I'm not saying Harden is bad at defence, but he's not one of the best 4 guard defenders in the league. In his current situation he isn't that good, and the current situation he's in is pretty much the ideal one. Switch him with any top defensive guard that he'd be competing with for a spot with, and the impact on their respective defences would be immediate"
Yeah fuck you Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook, famous post-first round performer"
russell westbrook
Then the rockets overperform and knock out the new Russell Westbrook thunder
Presti nailed his offseason. Sold high on Paul George at his absolute peak before his value went down (top 3 in MVP voting) and got back a great young player in SGA and a much needed sharpshooter in Gallo; traded Russell Westbrook for an undervalued Chris Paul AND two first round picks; and got a first round pick for Grant.
"It pains me to admit, but Russell Westbrook might be good at basketball"
"The Russell Westbrook slander has to stop dude... cp3 is a top 5 all time point but let’s not forget in his prime in LA russ would destroy him in the playoffs, and just in general.. he’ll probably torch cp3 again in the first round... but because he’s missing part of the series I think that’s why we win this"
"Russell Westbrook 3 Attempts: 7.2  Russell Westbrook Open Shots (defender 4-6 feet away): 3.3  Russell Westbrook Wide Open Shots (defender 6+ feet away): 2.2  5.5 out of 7.2 of his 3 points shots were open according to NBA.com. So yes they didn't respect his shot. But yes, keep talking about how I don't know anything. He shot 37 percent from wide open shots not 40. Stop pulling shit out of your ass.   https://stats.nba.com/player/201566/shots-dash/?Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season"
I'll be your friend if you support our lord and savior Russell Westbrook
Agree.  Russell Westbrook is hurt and supposed to miss time.  This isn’t a hot take. The thunder definitely can beat the rockets without Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook. I have never understood why people think shooting so much and so poorly is actually helping his team. If he focused on creating for others he would be unstoppable. Instead hes a guy who I imagine NBA coaches privately hope will go for 40 against their team.  A move to SG and his own version of Eric Snow would do his impact wonders IMO.
Russell Westbrook
"Never. But the OP is wrong. The kind of team the OP is describing is the only way to get the most out of a team led by an Allen Iverson or Russell Westbrook, guys who are crazy ball hog, low efficiency types. Of course you are right the ceiling is not high enough to win it all.  But Lillard is being painted with the wrong brush, he is a vastly superior scorer to those 2 and completely capable of integrating with a team as well. He just needs a little more support than hes got so far."
"Just for fun, here's this year's top 10 vs last year's:  2019 top 10| PPG | 2020 top 10 | PPG ---|---|----|---- James Harden | 36.1 | James Harden | 34.4 Paul George| 28.0 | Bradley Beal | 30.5 Giannis Antetokounmpo| 27.7 | Damian Lillard| 30.0 Joel Embiid | 27.5 | Trae Young | 29.6 Stephen Curry| 27.3 |Giannis Antetokounmpo | 29.5 Kawhi Leonard | 26.6 | Luka Dončić | 28.8 Devin Booker| 26.6 | Russell Westbrook | 27.3 Kevin Durant | 26.0 | Kawhi Leonard| 27.1 Damian Lillard | 25.8 | Devin Booker| 26.6 Kemba Walker| 25.6 | Anthony Davis | 26.1"
"So somehow after beating the Lillard Warriors with Russell Westbrook, and being in the NBA finals, KD decides to take a backwards step when he wants to win a ring by going to a worse team?"
"Oladipo got free rein to be the man in Indiana following the trade with a perennial all-star PG  because of what? His Orlando performances? Also, Oladipo himself attributed part of his success to learning from Westbrook.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2017/11/29/victor-oladipo-praises-russell-westbrook-during-career-year-i-learned-so-much-from-him/amp/"
"Oh yeah, MDA would never want to coach a player that puts consistent pressure on the rim and creates incredible amounts of open 3’s.  Enough about Russell Westbrook though"
"Where is this coming from? Trae young, luka doncic, russell westbrook and lebron James all have nearly the same leash that harden has.  What do they all have in common?  The handles and playmaking to have the ball in their hands at all times.  MDA isnt the reason Harden has such high usage, his talent is.  We have moved passed the idea that players need ro have a position and only the point guard handles the ball.  Were now in an era where the best player handles the ball provided he is a good enough passer and dribbler to effectively run an offense.  Harden shoots so often because he is far and away the most efficient scorer on the team.  Trae young just scored 30 points a game and had 9 assissts. Luka has 9 assissts and almost 30 points.  Lebron 10 assissts and 25 points.  The league is changing and its not because MDA gives harden a longer leash than other coaches give their star players, hes just the best at it.  Just like how Curry isnt given a longer leash to shoot, curry earned the right to shoot."
"Because they were the aforementioned peasants?   But you have to remember that some other players in that era WERE putting up crazy ""Wilt-like"" stats. I mean shit, Bill Russell averaged over 22 rebounds per game over his entire career. Stats were goofy as fuck back then. Pretty much every center was putting up gaudy numbers, and then there were also guys like Oscar Robertson who basically averaged a triple double for several years, and Jerry West who was another ridiculous scorer who shot the lights out.   But the pace back then was lightning fast, not slow like the other guy suggested.   I think someone did some normalization and found that Russell Westbrook would've averaged something like 40ppg at that pace playing his normal ~34 minutes."
Russell Westbrook
"Lol, are you really debating Lillard right now who is fighting for a playoff spot over MVP russell westbrook"
"&gt; You can’t say that past performances hold as much weight as skill set and current ability  But they do. Being an MVP or championship player is about more than just skillset and current ability. It's a reputation you have to earn over several seasons in the NBA. Every single player in my Tier 1 has been in the league for at least 6-7 years. That's where I think you're getting caught up. My list isn't solely on individual accolades and statistics. It's about players who have consistently made the playoffs year in and year out while putting up the statistics and earning accolades along the way. How can I put Luka in that group when he hasn't even gotten the chance to prove himself in the NBA? And you say ""past performances"" like Westbrook hasn't averaged a triple-double as recently as the 2018-2019 season.   &gt;Luka is a top 10 player and so is Dame so you can’t really dock them for not winning awards, which ultimately don’t mean as much in terms of career success and playoff success.  Dame isn't an unquestionably better player than Westbrook. Sure at his peak he's a better scorer, but he has nowhere near the all-around impact that Westbrook has. Both of them are point guards and can be game planned for much easier than a wing player like Luka who can also be used off the ball. This is why I'm interested to see how Westbrook does with Harden in this year's playoffs, because it will be a different style of play where he's playing more off-ball and teams can't take advantage of his one weakness (perimeter shooting) as easily as they could while he was the primary ball-handler in Houston. Dame is also in a similar boat. He's disappeared scoring-wise in plenty of playoff games and series and while a lot of that was due to defensive schemes, at some point you simply have to take over. The view of Russell Westbrook is entirely subjective. In terms of all-around impact there are not 10 players in the NBA who can do what Westbrook does. But yes it is debatable. Either way his body of work speaks for itself overall.   &gt; I think the most accurate way to check this is if X was on a team with league average players in the average system how would they control the offense and or defense  Let's use this metric. Westbrook's 2016-2017 Thunder falls into the category of average players in an average system. The Thunder have relied on talent for years, not necessarily coaching. He had Victor Oladipo but Oladipo was nowhere near what he became in Indiana. Compare that to this year's Mavericks team, which as a whole combined with coaching is actually much better than that year's Thunder team, especially considering Porzingis played almost 60 games. That year Westbrook averaged a triple double, dragged his team to a 47-35 record as the 6th seed, and won the MVP award. This year the Mavericks are 43-31 (only played 74 games so far but in an 82 game season the record would likely be very similar) as a better team, though Luka was very close to averaging a triple double but he won't win the MVP award. So Luka doesn't necessarily have the edge over Westbrook in this situation and if anything they may be almost even. And the rebuttal that Luka is only in his second year strengthens my argument that I can't place him at that level without a legitimate sample size. This is where the whole body of work comes in. Westbrook has a longevity advantage that's why he deserves to be in that tier.  &gt;Also if we are going by awards Luka has more international cache then Russ as a kid playing against grown men which is more impressive then what Russ did on teams with legit co stars supporting him.  But this doesn't reinforce his status as an *NBA superstar*. Many basketball fans did not know who Luka was until the few months leading up to the draft the year he came into the league. He was by no means a household name. His international status doesn't give him NBA superstar rights. I'm not attempting to disrespect Luka's accomplishments in Europe, but this is about what these players have accomplished in the National Basketball Association against the best basketball players in the world.   Overall Luka doesn't meet all the criteria to put him into my Tier 1. He's too good to be placed into the Tier 2. Luka is the sole reason I created that third tier, because it's for *any* player who doesn't have the sample size to justify me putting them in any of the top two tiers. If I solely looked at skillset and current ability I would have Luka in Tier 1, and guys like Tatum, Towns, Booker, etc already in Tier 2. But at the end of the day longevity is part of the criteria I truly believe is required to give a player legitimate superstar or MVP/championship player status. Doesn't mean Luka isn't good enough to be there. Honestly with an excellent playoff performance he can vault into that Tier 1, but what if he goes out there and performs horribly? Then there is no reason to put him into my Tier 1. That's why I use longevity and I don't want to deal with hypotheticals or what ifs when placing these players into tiers. All that aside though, this is a great debate we're having and much respect that you are actually coming back at me with your own logic and reasoning rather than a quick-jerk reactions."
He’s basically Russell Westbrook but with more height and worse shooting deficiencies
"Alright this has got to be a case where I accidentally wished for ""Russell Westbrook please don't play the Thunder in the first round"" instead of ""Houston Rockets please don't play the Thunder in the first round"" and had it granted.  Stupid monkey's paw."
Bill Walton  Dirk Nowitzki  Rick Barry  Tim Duncan  Russell Westbrook
"The ownership pushed it through, hes quoted saying his front office got cold feet and he said just get it done. Eitherway both of these point guards are incredible to have on your team unless you asked the blog boys who felt chris paul was too old and Russell westbrook i too busy stat padding to learn to play more efficiently..."
"Harden has had all star Dwight Howard (not Orlando Dwight but still solid), Chris Paul and now Russell Westbrook (2 seasons removed from his MVP year). Dude has had plenty of help. Not quite LeBron/Steph Curry levels of help, but a hell of a lot more than the teams Dirk or Minnesota KG had.  Harden's teams also are 100% tailored to his skillset."
"Funny thing happened last night, me and my dad were talking about the Rockets Thunder series and my dad said ""Well, if there's one thing you can count on not showing up in the playoffs when it matters most, its CP3.""   And I'm legit sitting thinking he's about to say James Harden's name cause he fits that description too.   The on thing we could agree on was that Westbrook always shows up for the playoffs....as Russell Westbrook. For better or for worse, he shows up always playing 100%. Which can't really be said for either Harden or Paul 100% of the time."
"I mean, the Bucks are the Russell Westbrook of teams. Extremely dominant in the regular season, like historically dominant, and then crash and burns in the playoffs"
\~2013  * Steph Curry (23) * James Harden (23) * Kevin Durant (23) * Russell Westbrook (24) * Damian Lillard (22) * Anthony Davis (20) * Blake Griffin (23) * Kyrie Irving (20) * Derrick Rose (23) * DeMar DeRozan (24)
"Actually, yes. Are you trying to win a championship after a full 82-game season? In that case Grant is more valuable* than Zion.  *) Zion is more valuable if you are selling shoes, ESPN ads, orthopedic surgical procedures, or gumbo.  ** ) I would *love* for Zion to prove me wrong, but if he loses a ton of weight he becomes... new Russell Westbrook? I honestly hope he pulls it off."
We will gladly give them one lightly used russell westbrook
Curry’s screening ability and off ball movement aren’t relevant to who he’s playing with. I could just as easily say that without Klay and Durang Curry would average far more assists cus every single play and basketball who have to come from him so his numbers would be inflated. Russell Westbrook averaged more assists in his MVP season than Lebron but saying he’s a better passer of the ball is just wrong
Wtf are they talking bout.insert russell Westbrook y’all tripping meme.
"This playoffs:  * Westbrook: 17.9 pts / 7.0 reb / 4.6 ast / 1.5 stl / 0.3 blk / 3.8 turnovers on 46.4% TS and atrocious defense  * George: 20.2 pts / 6.1 reb / 3.8 ast / 1.5 stl / 0.5 blk / 3.1 turnovers on 53.6% TS, still a good defender   In no world is Russell Westbrook a more desirable player to have on a playoff team right now than Paul George, even with George's poor playoffs."
Boo hoo. Lackluster teams? James Harden and Russell Westbrook? Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum? Two MVPs and 3 of the arguably top 5ish best (healthly) guards in the league? the Bubble Mvp? Cmon man you lost and we're still here. End of story.
"“Why do you think Harden has such a hard time getting allstars around him on the Rockets lol”  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook  Dwight Howard  6MenOTY Lou Williams and Eric Gordon  “If he dipped and went to, say the Bucks or the Lakers... he’d probably walk to a chip”  Lol. Paul George and Kawhi would like a word. The 2019 Warriors would like a word. The ‘97 Rockets would like a word. Etc etc etc  You seem to be mistaken that the real world is a videogame and they’re out there playing 2k. I’m sure u/mdzealot could pick up his life and family and integrate with entirely new personnel to replicate success time &amp; time again 🙄"
"The problem is the all star team allows 2 starting guards, 2 backs up guards and maybe 2 wildcards guards   Luka, Steph, dame will all make it for the first 3 spots. So at most only 3 of booker, Mitchell, murray, ja, Westbrook, klay, Russell, Fox, paul will be able to make it.  For the front court lebron, AD, jokic, kawhi will all make it leaving 2 backup spots left for either kat, Paul George, KP, Ingram, zion and the others would then compete for the wildcard spots.   Only 1 of zion or Ingram could make it also. And the t-wolves won’t be good enough for 2 all stars so no Russell   My guess is   Backcourt:  Starters:  Steph, luka Backups: Harden, Mitchell   Frontcourt:  Starters: Lebron, Kawhi, AD Backups: Jokic, Kat, PG  Wildcards  Booker, kinda a tossup with Murray/KP/zion/Ingram/ja/Westbrook I’ll say Murray tho"
Ahhh Antoine Walker. If Russell Westbrook was a PF. Where's his MVP?
"Do yall think he makes the ASG next year? As long as Jamal Murray stays in the west I don't see him making an all star team over Luka, Dame, Harden, Curry, Donovan Mitchell, D-Book, and then maybe even guys like Westbrook, Klay, CP3, and D'Angelo Russell. Not saying he's worse than all them, I just don't see people voting for him unless he really steps his regular season game up"
"for recent stuff? kyrie and russell westbrook both had surgeries that went wrong eventually and delayed their comeback. I think the same thing happened for roberson too. I'm sure it happens more often, but these guys do usually go to the best of the best because the teams can afford it."
he's usually guarding guys on the perimeter so Jokic and Murray take most of the rebounds to bring the ball up the floor. same thing when it was steven adams and russell westbrook. he's also not exactly the world's most instinctual defensive rebounder either so that's basically the gist of why he gets less boards than guards.
Tracy McGrady and Russell Westbrook have both had multiple series better than Jamal Murray
Christian Wood for most improved player. He'll have the opportunity to boost his stats since we are tanking he doesn't have to play to win. He can do the Russell Westbrook method
Your team is paying Russell Westbrook 41 million dollars next year.  Talk about yikes
"There are legit a good number of physically active ""fat"" people with better endurance than a lot of muscled up guys. Obviously it's still shocking to see it in NBA athletes but I've seen it too many times already. Endurance is built up mostly from consistent effort. Imagine Jokic getting fit, dude will be a patient 7-ft point guard capable of Russell Westbrook levels of energy lol"
"Ok, so he pulls a Russell Westbrook for another irrelevant triple double?"
"Sure, but what his teammates say about him says something, not everything. Same goes for articles like [this one](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2016/10/20/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant) - puff piece or not, it still bases its opinion of him based on what his teammates say and the way he behaves.   You wrote out a comment where one of your arguments was his playstyle, and you've never spent a single second with the guy talking to him, let alone seeing how he interacts with teammates inside the locker room. What teammates and articles say is infinitely more compelling than that."
"I liked this part especially:  &gt; Players that I want to monitor during these years: Melo, Paul George, Blake Griffin, Boogie Cousins, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Eric Bledsoe and Andre Drummond. If a combination of them somehow joined on one super team, this whole article could look really stupid"
Russell Westbrook
Do you not remember how terribly those teams were constructed? And Russell Westbrook is a terrible game manager... he's an athletic ball hog.
yall think donavon is a coach that can lead the bulls the a semi finals playoffs in the near future. I mean he did good with okc and they had russell westbrook and pg 13%
"https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/06/12/jerami-grant-leadership-of-russell-westbrook-reminiscent-of-jordan/  I mean you can criticize how he plays and his actions, but his teammates love him and look up to him"
"Had this conversation last time around about Russell Westbrook, don’t bother you will get downvoted. Somehow even after a deep playoff run people still don’t see the value herro and bam provide the team."
Russell Westbrook.  He's Zach LaVine with better teammates and a worse jumper.
"PG vs. SG is an outdated paradigm. I think of positions in 4 buckets: (1) Lead Playmaker, (2) Secondary Playmaker, (3) Wing Scorers/Defenders, and (4) Bigs  **Lead Playmakers** are guys like Harden, LeBron, Luka, Steph, KD, etc.  **Secondary Playmakers** are guys like Jamal Murray, Kemba Walker, SGA, Malcolm Brogdon, Gordon Hayward, Jrue Holiday, Draymond Green, etc.  **Wing Scorers/Defenders** are guys like Klay Thompson, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, Pascal Siakam, etc.  **Bigs** are guys like Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Karl Anthony-Towns  A few interesting thinks happen when you think of the roles in this way:  * Top players can fill multiples of these at once or be limited to just one role. LeBron and KD can fill all four roles, for instance. But Harden and Lillard can really only be a Lead Playmakers at this point in their career. * The best Bigs are guys who are also Secondary Playmakers and/or Wing Scorers/Defenders - think about Bam, Anthony Davis, and Jokic. * ""Unicorns"" are guys that can do at least 3 of the 4 with size - LeBron, KD, Porzingis, Giannis, Bam, AD, Jokic, KAT, etc.  The big question is whether young guys can transition into effective Lead Playmakers on a championship contending team. Here are some guys that we're asking that question about:  * Giannis, Luka, Tatum, Beal, Booker, Murray, Mitchell, Simmons, Trae, Ja Morant, D'Angelo Russell, etc. All of these guys are either unicorns, established Lead Playmakers, or Secondary Playmakers who have not yet played a Lead Playmaker role for a team that contended for a championship. * Giannis is definitely an elite Secondary Playmaker, Wing Scorer/Defender, and Big - the question is can he become a true Lead Playmaker or does he need to play with a Lead Playmaker? * We're watching Murray bloom into an elite Secondary Playmaker but the question is will he top out as an Elite Second Banana? * Donovan Mitchell is being deployed as a Lead Playmaker on the Jazz but does he have what it takes to become a highly efficient highly effective Lead Playmaker on a championship team? Unclear, but certainly trending in a positive direction. * Then there are guys like Paul George and Russell Westbrook who seem to have topped out at being inefficient Lead Playmakers or high-level Secondary Playmakers - if they're the best player on your team you are not going to win a championship.  That's my shitty take."
Honestly... It might be russell westbrook.
"lol Dejounte is not an above average starter. He's for sure a bottom 10 starting PG in the NBA, maybe bottom 5. There's also guys that come off the bench like Monte Morris that are better than him.  Lol why am I getting downvoted for this? Which of these players is Dejounte Better than? Suggesting Dejounte is an above average starter is just stupid.  Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Kyle Lowry, Russell Westbrook, Ben Simmons, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Ricky Rubio, D'angelo Russell, Eric Bledsoe, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, Malcolm Brogdon, Jamal Murray"
Russell Westbrook  Low IQ  Bad decision making  Tunnel vision  Bad shooting  Losing athleticism
"Get FVV, Tobias, and Russell Westbrook"
"I'm from the future, Russell Westbrook."
"and that's why the ""killer mentality"" is completely overrated. Russell Westbrook also has it but that's actually hurting his game because he can't slow down and think things through."
"Yeah people look at me sideways when I say that IT was a better athlete than Russell Westbrook or John Wall but I firmly believe it to be the case. Not that those guys aren't great, but to just to *make* the league at under 5-10 is almost a miracle. To dominate at that height is truly incredible."
"Russell Westbrook and Paul George.  Russell Westbrook's game 2 against the Lakers is underrated in how much he helped his team lose. That's an all-time performance by a superstar IMO, every single time he touched the basketball something bad happened. The Rockets went down early due to his turnovers leading to fast break points, and then erased a 20+ point lead with him on the bench, and then blew the lead to go down double digits again when he checked back in."
Russell Westbrook
"Marcus ""Russell Westbrook"" Smart"
Russell Westbrook. Oh shoot you said all-time. Never mind.
"People clamoring for her to lose her voting status because she forgot AD are ridiculous; at least the rest of her picks are defensible. I don't see anybody calling for Davide Chinellato for completely leaving Khris Middleton off his ballot. Not only did he leaving Middleton off his ballot, he put Russell Westbrook on the SECOND team AHEAD of James Harden, a legit MVP candidate.  I do agree with Gottlieb that these random announcers or ""analysts"" shouldn't be getting votes, especially if salaries are tied to All-NBA teams. The NBA should let the players and coaches decide these awards or continue to let the media decide the awards but remove the salary ramifications."
"They had good shooters in 2012, Westbrook chose to go braindead and was called out by everyone, including Magic calling him the worst point guard in history because he was shooting so much    Magic a guy who only says good obvious shit   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1223572-russell-westbrook-the-worst-point-guard-in-finals-history"

"I can't wait for it to be 2027 on r/nba and we're all clowning Ja Morant for being Russell Westbrook 2.0 and hating this ""always angry"" demeanor he has if he doesn't win championships by the age of 26."
"That's one thing, you can't let Rondo blow by you like he's prime Russell Westbrook. Although he's been doing that to guys this post-season. They're giving him space to make passes, not getting into his dribble or rushing him either."
Yet Russell Westbrook won in 2017 on the 6th seed.

"Also Boston fans: ""But he's actually playing better than Kyrie did""  As much as Kemba has struggled, Kyrie was worse.        Foo | Kemba| Kyrie ---|---|---- PPG| 19.8| 21.3 Games Played | 13| 9 Games under 37 FG%| 4| 7 20+ FGA games | 1 | 5  TS% for playoffs| 56.4| 48.8 Did he keep playing defence| Yes | No  The efficiency gap between Kemba and Kyrie in their Boston runs (7.6) is pretty absurd. That's getting close to the career efficiency gap between Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook (8.3).  * Kemba has been more efficient, he's tried to give the ball up when he's cold and he keeps playing defence.  * Kyrie was less efficient, he ball-hogged in spite of his inefficiency, he stopped playing defence outside of trying to 1v1 Giannis.   Nets fans: ""Yeah but Kemba didn't score 100 points on 5 shots every game, that means the guy who just got our coach fired is actually a really good person."""
"Westbrook not only had the slightly better season, he carried a worse team and did something that it hadn't been done since the 1960s and it hasn't been done since by any player outside of himself.  Westbrook has MANY flaws as a basketball player, in fact i think that Derrick Rose in his prime was a better basketball player than Russell is (comparing the two because i feel they were very similar), but what he achieved is absolutely insanity, yet all people do is hate on him due to his notorious flaws and say that he didn't deserve his MVP.  Despite being one of the worst shooters/decision makers in the league Westbrook still was able to put up a season that it still doesn't make any sense, that is a statement of how athletically gifted he is.  Russ makes me remember a lot of a Ray Lewis interview where he said that ""some young players get into the league and they are great in spite of not watching film, they get by insane athletic ability"". Watch his highlights of the 2012 Finals and tell me he is a different player now compared to his 23-year-old version, he's bulkier, but he's the same player."
“Literally fucking dying here” - PJ Tucker costarring “I don’t see shit” - James Harden and “I’ll give them more possessions and grab the popcorn” - Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook crushed one of the most legendary records in basketball history, and the team greatly benefited from it looking at advanced stats. He carried his team harder than anyone else in the league that year. At the VERY least, it should be a tossup."
Yes. Giannis is 7 ft Russell Westbrook. I’ve said it multiple times. Love Russ to death. Totally lacks skill. He’s just a bull in a China shop
"Russell Westbrook should have 0, Harden should have 2017, Lebron should have 2018.  Not sure what you mean by both, Harden only has one"
Russell Westbrook also came off the bench in the all star game in his MVP year

The only MVP award I really disagreed with was the Russell Westbrook one. That was purely narrative. That team had talent like Oladipo that Russ was arguably holding back. Not elevating. Even I got swept up in it and that Nuggets game winner sealed it for him. Every other pick has been solid.
"There's this competing friction between MVP voting and the championship contenders today where the best teams will often be the best TEAM with the most depth...which ends up belittling the star player's value in MVP votes.

He has Anthony Davis!'**   Howabout James Harden/Giannis/Russell Westbrook/etc?

&gt; He’s an average shooter on his best day  He takes like 2 threes per game and even then can't hit them at a league average clip. Russell Westbrook is also a great shooter on his best day but we all know that he's a bad one on average.
"All I see is reasons why the knicks would sign him here  Here’s mine:  Westbrook is a big name with a big fanbase, he is enough of a star that Dolan would ask to trade for because in his mind it means “finally a star to the knicks! The fans are going to love MVP RUSSELL FUCKING WESTBROOK” and then everyone will hate him even more /s"
"Lol where were all these blown rotations. They sure werent in game 5. He got beat once in the 4th quarter on a Torrey Craig where he wasnt paying attention that's really it.. Even Zach Lowe mentioned his defensive effort and intensity was fantastic that series. There's no player in the NBA who doenst miss rotations you can always find one or two in a series but in that game 5 specifically he was outstanding defensively and throughout the series was very good.  This is just a generalization people have been making about Kawhi for years. And it's true to an extent, hes definitely not 2016 Kawhi Leonard but htis season was also easily his best defensive performance since 2016/2017. It's a classic generalization that's overrcorrected itself because defense isnt something people pay as much attention to. He earned his All NBA defensive vote this year(didnt last season)  &gt;having a couple of flashy steals doesn't make a dominant defensive performance.  Another generalization, type of thing you would say about Russell Westbrook not someone like Kawhi Leonard who is not gambling out of position to make steals or make a defensive impact.   &gt;Kawhi's defensive motor has gone way down and he no longer will guard the teams best offensive player a majority of the time.   The DPOY in the NBA just won being a free safety the vast majority of the time people need to move past this level of logic in 2020. You can look up for yourself [who spent the most time defending no 1 options this year](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/). Plenty of good defenders near the top of the list, also ones who arent. The best guard defender in the NBA Marcus Smart isnt at the top as one ex. Kawhi doesnt spend as much time on top players as he used to yes, doesnt mean he still cant or isnt plenty impactful as a help defender."
"Some people are built to get regular season awards (aka Russell Westbrook, and no not calling giannis westbrook)  The playoffs are a different animal though. Different strategies, tempo, and overall more physical game.   He will learn to use that to his advantage once he gets out of his own head."
"He outplayed LeBron easily in their Finals showdown. If not for some questionable calls that favored Heat and Russell Westbrook being jackass that he is, who knows how would we view KD right now."
No way in hell is Russell Westbrook a superstar. I rather have Chris Paul than RWB.
Russell Westbrook is not close to a superstar. I must be confused because no way that is a debate
Fun Russell Westbrook stats:   First player in NBA to average four turnovers a game.  For several years averaged more fourth quarter turnovers in any guard in the league.
Paul George and Russell Westbrook.
"Allen Iverson. 42% career FG percentage. Took 3.5 three-pointers a game at a 31% clip. He had a lot of hussle and athleticism, but his skills are overrated.   For comparison, Russell Westbrook is often criticized for his shooting and he shoots 43.7% overall and 30.5 from 3.  If Iverson played today, I think he would be largely viewed as a volume shooter with low efficiency"
" A about 2 weeks back when the Rockets were going to go up against the Lakers in round 2 of the playoffs, I spent like 10 minutes in deep prayer hoping that they would actually win the series. And surprisingly they won the first game, I was hyped up, and then they went on to lose the next four and got eliminated. The day after they got eliminated I started having moments where everything would black out around me and I'd just be in one of the empty NBA bubble stadiums and PJ Tucker and James Harden would be there. There's also another figure standing in the shadows looking at me with a high visibility vest and a construction hat, I assume it's Russell Westbrook but I can't make out any of the features other than the clothing. Harden has a demented smile and he just stares at me while PJ Tucker with deformed legs just stands in front of me while he's guarding me, he also talks shit to me but whenever it stops I can't remember exactly what he said, just that he was talking shit to me. During the manifestation I'm paralyzed and can't move either. They've been happening around 3 times a day ever since the night after Game 5 when the Rockets lost. Can anyone explain what the fuck is going on? I don't know if it's sleep paralysis or some entity trying to punish me."
Imagine being a Lakers fan and going out of your way to defend Russell fucking Westbrook lmao
"The Thunder ran a Russell Westbrook-Semaj Christon-Andre Roberson-Enes Kanter-Steven Adams closing lineup against the Timberwolves in the Christmas game of 2016-17 season.   Semaj (19% from 3), Roberson (24% from 3), and Kanter (14% from 3) were spacing the floor for Russ, and Adams was in the paint.  Most exciting lineup I've ever seen"
[What.](https://tenor.com/view/russell-westbrook-westbrook-basketball-player-american-basketball-player-nba-gif-16377419)
Hey some of us have consistently bashed Russell Westbrook and just take the chance of them being awful to gloat about it.   I bet that’s the case of a lot of these thing and the hivemind just jumps on
"At least the heat made it to the finals tho, and I’m sure people said some ridiculous shit about them. Paul George was in the MVP race, sure, but Russell Westbrook literally won the MVP and look at what people’s opinion of him has been."
Didn’t know Russell Westbrook was a member of the Celtics locker room
Hold up.   Did you just indicate that Parsons and Lin are better playmakers than CP3 and Russell Westbrook?
"I don’t know the same ones that guarded Dame Lillard, CJ McCollum, James Harden, Russell Westbrook?"
"Might I add, the opposite of Russell Westbrook. Exciting to watch but not a winner."
"Just imagine if they had traded for Russell Westbrook before the season, so much potential down the drain"
Nope. https://www.google.com/amp/s/basketball.realgm.com/wiretap-amp/242007/Russell-Westbrook-Was-Offered-Partial-Academic-Scholarship-By-Stanford
I didn’t ask you what you thought so I’m going to rebuttal a little.   I’ll advices shots? What star player doesn’t take I’ll advised shots?   Doesn’t play to his own strengths? Didn’t he average a triple double by playing to his strengths for a couple years?   Turnover galore. And yet his teamster gets more turnovers then him  Imagine Gobert trying to play like Jokic. I don’t understand that reference.   Westbrook isn’t the best player in the league but everything you said could be attributed to a lot of star players. But when it comes to BBIQ Russell Westbrook has a ton of it. He’s able to read plays that the opposition is running. He’s able to use his body to take advantage of weaker defenders. He exploits defenses using his athletic ability.   He’s no CP3 or Rondo or LeBron when it comes to BBIQ but he’s also not a McGee
"I think they want some sort of new outstanding performance to be the MVP. For example, Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double everyone thought it was incredible, then he did it again no cared the second time. Lebron is usually the most dominant but when some like steph breaks the 3pt record by 100 3 or harden averages 35 for the first time, its pretty unprecedented at first"
"What is his ceiling then? I think he figured out how he can thrive in this league but I also don't see anything other than marginal improvements to his game to make it more complete a la Jimmy Butler. I think you have a little bias against Butler but also bias for Siakam as well. I can think of 15 players I would rate over Siakim easily. Keeping in mind that this has been Siakms breakout year and needs to come back just as good or better in order to knock a few off the list in my mind.   In no particular order LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Russell Westbrook, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Karl Anthony Towns, Chris Paul, currently Jimmy Butler and I would rate Kemba Walker over him currently and Jrue Holiday for his elite defense over Siakim. You could even make a case for Jayson Tatum being ranked over Siakim with their similar stats and role on their team and how that team performs.   That is just my opinion obviously and I think I listed almost 20 but yeah. You could try to make a case for the 15-25 for now but I don't see Siakim challenging Lebron, Durant, Harden, Curry, Leonard, Irving, Davis, or Giannis for a spot to just be in the top 5 conversation. To think at any point of the season Siakim was a top 5 player and has transcendent talent like any one of these guys shows an incredible bias."
"This probably isn’t a popular pick, but I think it’s gotta be Russell Westbrook"
"I bet you think I'm gonna say it's Russell Westbrook.  And you're right, I'm gonna say it's Russell Westbrook."
"All due respek, but you are having a giggle with that one.  Not only is westbrook a hot trash sandwich, the knicks have just reset and committed to building through the draft.  To cash those hard earned assets in on Russell fucking Westbrook of all people would lead to mass suicide in NY."
Paul George is a must better player than Russell Westbrook. And then you want to also give them Patrick Beverley one of the best lockdown defenders in the entire league. Not to mention that Paul George is also considered one of the best two-way players in the league. So I think this is an absolutely terrible idea but I respect your opinion
Remember Max Kellermans favorite player is Russell Westbrook. He hasn't said a word about Westbrook since Houstons defeat. Show is a joke. Molly Qurim Smith is also TRASH.
"IMO the problem at that point is where do you draw the line. Does it become the LeBron award? Would someone like Russell Westbrook in his MVP season reasonably be beaten out by anyone else? Even though he wasn’t the best player overall, how do you argue with his numbers? And do they vote for someone else simply to not give someone two awards?"
"Yep. Kind of ridiculous.  Added context.  &gt;George was asked about shifting his responsibilities to guarding then-rookie sensation Donovan Mitchell. He tilted his head, grinned and in his smooth baritone delivered a quip that has followed him since.   &gt;   &gt;""Y'all ain't met Playoff P yet, huh?""   &gt;   &gt;Playoff P was born in Oklahoma City, but Paul George and Russell Westbrook never reached the second round together. Layne Murdoch/NBAE via Getty Images   &gt;   &gt;The context around the moniker has gotten lost over time -- George was primarily referring to taking on the assignment of guarding the other team's best scorer -- but George might be as much to blame for that as anyone else.   &gt;   &gt;Asked what Playoff P looks like, he said, ""It's a fun guy to watch. It's an out-of-body person where I just lock in and put myself in a different zone.""

“One nba executive” so any person an any nba front office (could be someone on the magic for all we know) believes the Knicks could trade for Russell Westbrook (any team “could”). This article is bullshit.
"I mean he was just looking out for himself. Media drove home the idea that without a title you’re a nobody. But the problem was, what KD didn’t understand that being a somebody, doesn’t guarantee you being a legend like LeBron, MJ, Bird, Magic, Kareem, which KD thinks he deserves, and I also think he has the skills to do it too.   Looking how Russell Westbrook has pretty much been the same player forever, it’s crazy to think how amazing Durant is as a player to take that team to the Finals and losing to the living legend LeBron and that crazy build of a team in MIA. Durant can elevate a team as well as LeBron can, but he chose to go to a team that needed very little elevating and even though he got those FMVP, how the hell you gonna be a legend when you can’t even take over the team from Curry.   And because of that we value him less and every bad/wrong thing about KD will get scrutinized even harder, unless he can win one on his own. He could probably redeem himself with the Nets if he wins 1 and makes it to a couple finals within the remainder of his Nets contract."
I tried to read your abomination of a paragraph/list hybrid but Russell Westbrook at 9 gave me a mini stroke and he and Kyrie Irving ahead of James Harden gave me an actual stroke
"I mean, no. Let’s break it down.  The conversation was about the fact that Curry was a bad defender due to his height and build so you compared Steph to Russell Westbrook. The only logical explain for why you made this comparison was because you wanted to show that there are players who are Curry’s height who are good defenders.   This comparison makes no sense for a multitude of reasons, first Russ is a bad defender so this doesn’t even prove anything and secondly, as I’ve stated before, Russ is ten times more athletically gifted then Steph so it makes no sense to compare them like you did"
Russell Westbrook for Paul George straight up
Paul George for Russell Westbrook trade should happen
"&gt; Paul George is mentally weak...I class him with Russell Westbrook as guys who will NEVER win a championship as a ""star player.""  Embiid is showing signs of being this kind of guy too and it’s disheartening to see."
Simmons is essentially a giant Russell Westbrook.  Joel gotta be in trade talks from now on
"Blockbuster trade proposal of the day:   Celtics get:   * Chris Paul   * Joel Embiid   Sixers get:   * James Harden   * Dennis Schroder  Rockets get:   * Kemba Walker   * Steven Adams  * Daniel Theis   * Julius Randle   * Celtics 1st   * Knicks 1st   * Knicks pick swap   Knicks get:  * Russell Westbrook   * Hamidou Diallo  Thunder get:   * Gordon Hayward   * Tobias Harris   * Sixers 1st   * Celtics 1st   * Celtics pick swap x2   Celtics run CP3/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Embiid   Sixers run Schroder/Harden/Richardson/Simmons/Horford   Rockets run Walker/Gordon/Covington/Tucker/Theis with Randle, Adams off the bench   Knicks run Westbrook/Diallo/Barrett/Knox/Portis  Thunder run Shai/Dort/Hayward/Harris/Whoever  How do you think this trade should be tweaked? I think it’s a little unbalanced right now but I’m not sure where."
"&gt; If he knew he was leaving when sending off 2024 and 2026 FRPs for Russell Westbrook that's also eyebrow raising.  I believe the analytics group within Houston wasn't really fond of that trade, so this point doesn't really make much sense."
"The central question is when Morey knew he was leaving to the Sixers, if he knew he was going there while interviewing Doc for the Rockets job that's incredibly shady imo. If he knew he was leaving when sending off 2024 and 2026 FRPs for Russell Westbrook that's also eyebrow raising."
"I agree. Reddit is great. Considering you just strawmanned my entire argument. Not once did I say westbrook was bad.   What I said was that Westbrook in years past, was an amazing floor raiser (specifically during his mvp year). In the one season where we really got to see westbrook on his own, he was amazing, but let’s not forget he also shot a career high in 3pt% somehow that year as well. Ever since that season, despite having better teammates around him for spacing, his shooting from deep has only gone downwards (his 34% during his mvp year turned into 30% the next year, followed by 29% and 26% the last two years). However, we’ve seen a steady downtrend in Westbrook’s on court proficiency since that year. It’s hard for me to see that magically trending up again now that westbrook is on the wrong side of 30 and would have terrible spacing on the Knicks.   Beyond that, yes I did also mention that despite Westbrook’s decrease in 3pt shooting, a good portion of his resurgence is in part due to the rockets committing full time to small ball to help raise his floor. And I fail to see how that’s wrong, especially considering he shot a career high field goal percentage on 2’s this year. Which again, pulls into my previous point, Russell is still a star and he’ll get his points, but it’s a lot more likely we’ll see last year w thunder Westbrook than rockets westbrook if he goes to the Knicks because the Knicks simply don’t have the tools to help Westbrook’s maximize his skills and playstyle.   Not everything is so black and white. You can acknowledge that the rockets playing the way they did objectively helped westbrook out, it’s not an insult. He’s still a very talented player. But it’s clear as day that even with that, he’s not the player he was 4 years ago."
"hi, i'm tilman.  hi, i'm daryl.  good to meet you.  did you know i pulled a 65 win team out of my ass just this year?  yeah, nerd, that's nice, i need you to trade for russell westbrook.  but my numbers indicate he is terrible, sir.  yeah, but i think he's exciting.  but i just wanna win.  just shut up and listen.  you're trading for russ.

Well at least you don’t have to ever worry about Russell Westbrook being hesitant to shoot!
Morey isn't a slave to analytics though. He traded for Russell Westbrook. Most analytics say that's a bad idea.

"Past westbrook is one of the better floor raisers. With current westbrook, we don’t know how much that carries over. Statistically, he had a really good season in Houston but that’s mainly because of Houston committing fully to small ball which opened the floor for him. The Knicks are the anti-rockets. His floor spacing there would be worse than it was on the famed Westbrook mvp-year thunder team and russell is clearly not the same player he was that year."
.....No. Russell Westbrook is a terrible idea for the Knicks. CP3's contract would be way more bearable because CP3 is a team player and could build up his teammates. I dont want Mitchell Robinson backing away from obvious rebounds so Russ doesn't throw a tantrum like how Steven Adams used to do.
"Who's available and might push them to WCF contenders immediately?  Paul George, Marc Gasol, Andre Drummond, Demar Derozan, Jonas Valenciunas, Nicola Vucevic, Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Mike Conley, Russell Westbrook is maybe available, maybe James Harden's available, maybe Derrick Rose helps them enough, maybe Eric Bledsoe helps them enough, JJ Reddick and Eric Gordon same."
"&gt;SNY's Ian Begley reported Wednesday that some agents believe the Knicks ""would poke around on a potential Russell Westbrook trade if Houston makes him available,""   The title makes it sound like the Knicks want to trade for Russ.  The article just says we're checking the asking price."
Saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/gzz0cp/variety_russell_westbrook_on_coproducing_a/) a few months back about Russell Westbrook pursuing something similar. Could they end up collaborating or will we see two separate documentaries on this topic?
Remember when Russell Westbrook was the Pac 12 defensive player of the year and scouts were thinking he was going to be a Tony Allen type player?
"Corey Brewer, Kyle Lowry, Tim Duncan, Russell Westbrook, Robin Lopez/mascot"
"I mean he cooked John Wall speedwise at the summer league his rookie year. (He didn’t really outplay, just saying he was fast.) And even on camera you could tell this dude moved like that Russell Westbrook type of charging speed."
"i'm not saying nothing else matters - i'm just comparing westbrook to paul george and regularizing the stats between them since you said westbrook put up good numbers on a good team. if you don't think putting up good numbers is enough to be a good player, i agree, but that's the *only argument for westbrook*. for what its worth, westbrook only played 32 minutes a game in the playoffs despite d'antoni running a seven man rotation, probably because he was so awful in those minutes.   it's actually mindblowing that you're giving westbrook credit for the small-ball system they run. the rockets traded capela because he was hurt, but they also struggled playing westbrook/capela, two non-shooters in that scheme. the two-man pairing of westbrook/capela was the fourth worst on the rockets, followed by house/mclemore, rivers/westbrook, and gordon/tucker.   if anything that trade was to benefit westbrook, adding another shooter to the perimeter and allowing him to play in the paint. what you saw in the playoffs was teams like the lakers realizing westbrook wouldn't shoot and leaving him to double harden. that's not an issue with houston's scheme, it's an issue with westbrooks bad shooting.   the timberwolves only had russell for 12 games. i'm not sure why you're blaming towns for the 24th best offense either - 115.7 orating with him on, 103.7 rating with him off. the clippers who were 2nd in orating are at 114.7. the warriors who are last are at 105.9.  if you think he's that bad of a defender, and that the wolves can't put together a good defense with him at center, fine maybe. but the bad offense thing couldn't be less of his fault if he's not on the court when they're bad, and when he's on, they're elite."
"Anthony Edwards shooting percentages are pretty appalling when you consider that he's a projected number one pick. What really matters is good form, which both Edwards and Killian have. There is a pretty long track record of players who shoot like ass in college/internationally and then became great NBA players - with or without a good jumpshot. Kawhi, Luka, Trevor Ariza, Russell Westbrook, Jaylen Brown, etc.  I don't think this class is bad at all."
"Lonzo and Ben Simmons weren't good college defenders and both turned out to be great NBA defenders. You absolutely do not know what you're talking about if you think that because someone isn't a lockdown defender in college then he can't be a good defender.   Michael freaking Jordan wasn't a elite defender in college and Russell Westbrook was perceived as one, what the fuck you are smoking."
"Some may hate it but my vote is Russell Westbrook.  The guy always put it all out on the field/court. He played on a mixture of teams with immense potential, disappointment, bad coaching, etc. When healthy, he is one of the most dominant players - the type that demanded defensive gameplans to scheme around him."
"I’ll admit jump shooting isn’t his forte, but he is far from awful. He shut 37% from 3 pt range, very respectable. Also, let’s not forget Lebron has hit an elbow jumper to clinch a championship (2013). I will also point to towards the entire 2018 playoffs.  Apart from that he’s probably the best finisher in nba history, definitely the best passer on that listc, and an argument can be made that he’s the most efficient scorer. He’s only the fourth player to lead the nba in scoring and assists, after tiny archibald, James harden, and Russell Westbrook.  Pretty strong case for best offensive player imo"

TIL Russell Westbrook has a signature shoe
"**Perspective from a pure business &amp; box office value standpoint:**  1. **LeBron James** - Dude is still the biggest draw in the NBA, he sells the most jerseys/merch and brings in new audiences into your organization. Even if he's aging, he'll still bring in loads of money and championships with the 3-4 potential years you have left with him, and that can arguably be way more valuable financially than a 20 year old up-and-comer. 2. **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - The best of all worlds - b2b MVP, explosive box office talent, and also a superstar for championships for many years to come. If LeBron only had perhaps only 2 seasons left to play, then I would switch LeBron &amp; Giannis. 3. **Luka Doncic** - Highest youth/potential attributes. Can't pass up Luka over anyone under him due to the possibilities the future holds for his career. 4. **Anthony Davis** - Isn't top 3 only due to his injury history. Other than that, a no-brainer. 5. **Jayson Tatum** - Just like Luka, youth/potential but with less draw. 6. **Steph Curry** - Still a big draw, and he's definitely on the older side of 30.. however, his game remains age-friendly as a lot of his prowess comes from his shot making capability. 7. **James Harden** - I can see him doing his thing for another 3 years before falling off, but he just brings so much value overall that he has to be on this list somewhere. 8. **Zion Williamson** - It's Zion. Even if he doesn't live up to the hype, the dude is looked at as pure entertainment.  9. **Kawhi Leonard** - A powerhouse talent with a good amount of years left in him. 10. **Nikola Jokic** - Much like Kawhi, he isn't the biggest draw but he's got everything else. Youth, potential, talent and a fairly good track record towards win value.  **Honorable mentions:** *Joel Embiid, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Trae Young, Ben Simmons*  **Perspective from a pure basketball talent value contributing towards the best chance for winning championships:**  1. **LeBron James** - Still LeBron at #1. Some of the players listed below him might not even sniff the Finals (again, or ever), while LeBron even with only 3-4 years left to play could have the most potential to get another chip. 2. **Kawhi Leonard** - Yes he choked hard this year, but it's not like Kawhi suddenly lost his track record of winning. I would still take him over any player under him for at least 4 more years. 3. **Luka Doncic** - He's already shown that he's likely gonna be a MVP candidate and a centerpiece for a team at age 20. Undeniably the best of both worlds player in terms of youth/talent. 4. **Anthony Davis** - He doesn't seem like he can play the alpha role, but regardless, the talent level is through the roof. Still relatively young as well, but slight issue once again with his injury history. 5. **Nikola Jokic** - Best center in the league and also has the youth. He's also shown he can make a winning environment around him. 6. **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - He gets knocked down a few pegs due to his lack of winning intangibles yet to be shown. But he's still pretty young and his talent is ridiculous so that keeps him in the top 4. 7. **Kevin Durant** - This is the big ""what if"" sorta thing. What if he can return back to his normal self following his injury? Arguably the best player in the league if he does, for at least another 2-3 years. Also, he has age-friendly talent. 8. **Donovan Mitchell** - This is my bias pick. I just believe in him. The dude has some of the best intangibles I've seen in a young player. Overall love his demeanor and he shows a bit of that mamba mentality. 9. **Jayson Tatum** - The youth is strong on him, and also has shown he's able to improve year after year. He's shown me enough to allow me to acknowledge that he can be big-time. 10. **Damian Lillard** - If he was in the right situation, he probably would have had a few chips under his belt. He has the mindset I look for most in a player - just a killer mentality and insane work ethic and love for his craft.  **Honorable mention:** *Jimmy Butler, Jamal Murray, Devin Booker*  **Q &amp; A:**  1. *Q: ""Why the disrespect on Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons bruh?""*  **A: Embiid has a horrid injury history. More importantly, he also has shown no winning intangibles and his work ethic is not admirable to me. Previous sentence also applies to Ben Simmons, except it's worse for him.**  2. *Q: ""No KAT anywhere? Not even an honorable mention?""*  **A: KAT is an amazing talent.. like unbelievable talent for his position. But, he doesn't have any box office draw nor has he shown any winning intangibles. He looks like he plays for individual accolades and nothing much more beyond that.**  3. *Q: ""Why are you doing a Q &amp; A by yourself, with questions made up by your own? You're so narcissistic.""*  **A: I don't know why... maybe I should delete this section...... NAHHH! Just hit submit!**"
"&gt; Only LeBron James ($32 million) earns more from sneaker endorsements than Durant’s $26 million per year Nike deal, according to Forbes. Irving is seventh at $11 million behind Russell Westbrook ($12 million), Zion Williamson ($13 million), James Harden ($14 million) and Steph Curry ($20 million). Michael Jordan is still the unquestionable king earning $130 million per year from Nike.   This is pretty surprising.  I didn't realise Kyrie was behind Russ/Zion and half of Curry. His shoes have always been super prominent, I thought he'd be making more than he does.   Looking at the list, I would have had him closer to ~18m."
"&gt; Then they cut back to Jordan. ""Thirty years ago, that's me,"" he said of Westbrook. ""The attitude, trying to prove myself, showing so much passion for the game of basketball. You see it in his play. You can tell he loves the game, he plays with energy and flair.""   [Michael Jordan says Russell Westbrook reminds him of younger self](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-jordan-says-russell-westbrook-reminds-him-of-his-younger-self/)"
Is it D’Angelo Russell or Russell Westbrook? Russ has the gap in his teeth but idk.
"But Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook are so much closer in athleticism than Della Donne and an NBA player in the 10th percentile in terms of athleticism. She would get straight up eaten alive, even against college teams. The athleticism deficit is just too big to overcome, no matter how skilled you get."
"Russell is the sole reason Skip gets paid millions of dollars to double down on his ""eye test"" argument that he says every day on national TV.   Is there a player with more empty stats than Russell Westbrook? I mean I would even take prime Allen Iverson over him."
I don't think so. Athleticism isn't everything. That's why Chris Paul &gt; Russell Westbrook.  But to each their own.
Russell Westbrook - Ballhog   FTFY
Russell Westbrook
&gt; Russell Westbrook - Balrog  Always thought Russ kinda reminded me of Mike Tyson too lol
James Harden - maybe Zangief style with the beard and his old faux hawk  Jeremy Lin - Fei Long (lol)  Robin Lopez - Blanka  Russell Westbrook - Balrog  Kareem Abdul Jabbar - Sagat
Pyramid answer: Things you shouldn't say to Russell Westbrook
If you look at his rebound splits in the last 3 years - you can see the Russell westbrook stat stuffer effect.
"Ofc, I didn’t say they weren’t, he’s just not freakish in every possible manner like someone like lebron or Russell Westbrook is."
PG mightve been better off with Russell Westbrook
"My biggest criticism of Giannis isn't even his shooting.  I think he has time to improve (already improving) that but I think his biggest weakness is a lack of counter moves.  If you stop or impede his straight line drive he has no counter or plan b.  His footwork is not good and I think that's mostly because he takes long strides.  He draws alot of offensive fouls and throws out of control passes/shots when teams can focus on him and have the athletes to make him work harder for his strengths.    He really does remind me of a 6'11"" Russell Westbrook at times."

No it's Russell Westbrook LMAO
"Chris Paul 82 game seasons played? 1. John Stockton 82 game seasons played? 16, and it would be 17 if we counted the shortened lock down season where he played 50/50 games.  As for the All-NBA, it's nice how you decided to only mention first teams, since if you included all nods then Stockton has more. It's not like he had to compete with any superstar guards for the spots, like Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. Take away one of those two and Stockton has another 4 first teams, and Paul sure as fuck wasn't going to take one of their spots away.  Forgive me for not being suitably impressed that Paul was better than Russell Westbrook and Tony Parker while Stockton was competing with Drexler, Payton, Thomas, Penny, Kidd, MJ and Magic."
yeah its even weirder bc ja is a big fan of russell westbrook. i'd have figured chandler parsons if anyone. if not him someone on the spurs or warriors
"At least in terms of 2K, an 86 would put him on the level of Nikola Vuecevic and DeMar DeRozan, and Butler is clearly better than those two, and an 87 would put him below players like Pascal Siakam and Russell Westbrook, which you could argue he's on the level on or even higher.  I guess my reply was a bit too much, but I definitely feel he'd be on a 88-89 overall."
"Russell Westbrook, because he is possibly the only one of those 4 players listed that is seen as a net negative by a lot of people on here.  If he could win as the main option, it would silence his critics.  Hardly any person on here says ""I wouldn't want CP3/Dame/Harden on my team!"".  But a lot do that with Westbrook, so it has to be him."
"I'd argue with you about that, but then I remember that a Paul George/Russell Westbrook duo got bounced by a rookie by the name of Donovan Mitchell."
"Steph Curry, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Chauncey Billups, Tony Parker, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Deron Williams"
1. Russell Westbrook 2. KD 3. Steven Adams  4. Bill Russell  5. Lebron James  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Shaq 8. Dirk 9. CP3 10. Harden
"Paul George scored 5 points in this elimination game, Russell Westbrook made 7/19 threes while PG went for a whopping 0/6. I don’t blame him for going down swinging since his star teammate couldn’t even get double digits but it was sad to see"
"Pro comps: Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook"
"I don't have to imagine, my favourite non Pistons ever Russell Westbrook plays for your Houston Rockets \^\^, and that same franchise just fired MDA who was with Russ the only reason for me not to have them as the franchise I hate the most \^\^"
"Harden is litterally getting double teamed at halfcourt without any screen.  Any PNR involving Steph Curry attracts a double team.  KD in OKC played with a team where best source of spacing was Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka elbow jumpers.  Harden got to the WCF with a 40 years old Jet Terry as his secondary ball handler.  Lebron went to the finals with Kevin Love and role players.  They all had their fair share of playoffs disapointments, they also NEVER EVER look as bad as Giannis looked those series against Miami and Toronto.  &amp;#x200B;  BTW Giannis got A LOT offensively from Lopez and Middleton in that Miami series, HE was the one that was inefficient offensively"
Lebron said this was his best year ever? Do you consider this peak lebron?   Nobody is gonna say they/their current team was worse. Heck you could ask Russell Westbrook and he’d probably say he’s better than his MVP season.
"You can lump in Reggie Jackson as well.     He left OKC because thinking he was better than Russell fucking Westbrook.    Currently he hasn’t been doing well, of course."
"Per Woj:  “Had Presti been able to strike a deal for George with the Raptors — and Leonard was willing to stay — George was believed to be willing to join the Raptors too, sources said. Presti pursued a package of Russell Westbrook with George to the Raptors — with the NBA’s Most Improved Player, forward Pascal Siakam as the centerpiece of a deal — and Ujiri balked, league sources said....  ... In the end, Toronto didn't have assets to satisfy OKC --- with or without Siakam in any proposed deal. The fear of Toronto entering into trade talks with OKC only proved to guarantee the Clippers would go the distance with five first-round picks and SGA in deal for George.”"
"Tough when you consider PG can opt out next year. Only team that might do it for a shot at the title &amp; salary relief next summer is Houston with Russell westbrook. They REALLY need a playmaker in the playoffs, but idk if the clips want to work around Russ's weaknesses &amp; deal w/ his contract, Im sure it would take quite a bit more sweetener besides the obvious, Daniel House."
This dude looks like Russell Westbrook and Cam Newton had a horny baby boy.
Russell westbrook
"Jusuf Nurkic: Here I am at Costco waiting 2 hours for a tire replacement when I decide to cross the street to In-N-Out for a bite to eat. I order a grilled cheese because I heard they make them good. It was a solid 2/10. Suddenly a colossal bearded man enters wearing sunglasses and a Portland shirt, a beautiful babe by his side. I immediately recognize him as Jusuf Nurkic. “Hey Nurk!” I cry. “What up, man?” He says. I allowed him to proceed with his lunch without further interruption, but what an unexpected twist to my day.  Paul Pierce: I went to a Clippers game a few years ago and had seats pretty close to the floor (I think CP3/Griffin were hurt, plus my dad bought the tickets anyway). Wesley Johnson came out of the tunnel so I tried to go get his autograph but the security guard stopped me. I told him ""please Wesley Johnson is on my fantasy team I'm a huge fan"" and he actually believed that so he let me through. Paul Pierce was on the team that year as well but wasn't playing. I constantly shouted his name throughout the entire game and finally got his attention, but hadn't planned that far in advance, so I continued to shout his own name to his face. He was really confused but laughed. Also saw Alan Anderson almost punch out Blake Griffin for refusing to hand him a seat cushion.  Russell Westbrook: Saw Russ at UCLA during the summer of 2014. Before I knew what was happening, my body was running towards him screaming ""RUUUUUUUSSSSSS!!!!!"" He was cool about it though, gave me a fist bump.  Trevor Ariza: I saw Ariza at Disneyland with his son last summer. At first glance I was like “damn that guy tall” and then I was like “holy shit that’s Trevor Ariza."" Didn't age well, as he recently had child abuse claims filed against him."
Russell Westbrook has said he doesn't like to rest either.
"If the Knicks get Paul George and Russell Westbrook, then Melo comes back... That sounds like a pretty good team?"
"Alex Caruso has more rings than Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and James Harden"
"When its all said and done I garentee Giannis will be among that very same list, James harden, Russell Westbrook ect doesn't mean they're some of the greatest passers ever."
I can’t tell if this is Cam Newton or Russell Westbrook.
Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook for the UCLA reunion
Durant def took hard shots. I think its the fact that on the warriors he had more options on offense and the defense couldn't put him in a hole or force his hand offensively  you go from Russell Westbrook and Roberson to curry and klay with a forward who can set you up... Durant is feasting
Normal Russell Westbrook looks mad as hell  now imagine Angry Russell Westbrook
"yeah it's KG for me. he's the most portable player of all time in the sense that he fits every team composition possible. there is no Russell Westbrook or Gobert situation with fit. he elevated teammates, defended 1-5 for most of his career, could create his own shot (though shot selection wasn't amazing), but if he came into the league today, people would think he's clearly the best big man in the NBA. he'd grow up shooting threes instead of the long twos and he'd be unbelievable."
Russell Westbrook is not a positive trade asset at this point
Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook
So it's either he is a taller/stronger Russell Westbrook or a taller Chris Paul.
"Then he'd be a taller, stronger Russell Westbrook."
Giannis and Brook Lopez.  Brook being used as essentially a sharpshooting 3 and D rim protector is wild imo. Also i cant think of anyone that uses their athletic dominance to run to the rim like Giannis besides maybe Russell Westbrook
"It’s easy for a casual NFL fan to assume a great athlete (Usain Bolt, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James) could be thrown into the league and dominate from physical attributes alone.   NFL players’ bodies are built for that and have spent years fine-tuning their skills. LeBron would get hurt in his first game in the NFL if he went without proper training / preparation"
Lou Will = Bubbles from The Wire Russell Westbrook = Bodie from The Wire
"This is the 37-16 range.   3A: Bam Adebayo, Jamal Murray, Karl Anthony Towns, Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kemba Walker and Kyle Lowry.   3B: Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Kyrie Irving, Devin Booker, Draymond Green and Pascal Siakam.   3C: Ja Morant, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook, Zion Williamson, Jaylen Brown Kristaps Porzingis and Trae Young."
Shout-out Damian Lillard/Jamal Murray/Russell Westbrook/ Dennis Schroeder/Patbev/Dwyane Wade/Kevin Garnett
Russell Westbrook has had an ok career I think.
Maybe Russell Westbrook?
It depends on what trade you’re talking about with the Rockets. When they tried to trade for Jimmy Butler they only offered picks with rigid restrictions making them less valuable.  When they traded for Russell Westbrook they gave away valuable picks alongside the best player in the trade.
"It's crazy to think that during a five-year stretch OKC had one or more of Chris Paul, Paul George, Victor Oladipo, Russell Westbrook, and Kevin Durant."
Different type of athleticism. Russell Westbrook is a bulldozer but no one can contort their body mid-air the way Rose can. Rose has got some insane core strength
Yea cause STATS is all that matters. I guess Russell Westbrook is the best PG ever with his ridiculous numbers the last few years.
R/nba most hated   1a. Russell Westbrook   1b. Paul George    Hugh gap  3. Kevin Durant   4. Kyrie Irving   5. James Harden   6. Ben Simmons   7. Patrick Beverly   8. Marcus Morris Sr  9. Lebron James   10. Demar DeRozan (outside of Raptors fans is low key kinda hated here)
"Russell Westbrook is 16 ounces of espresso, Monster and Red Bull washed down by a can of FourLoco.  KD is gravy on sorbet.  That prolly would have been one of my favorite teams if they had managed to make it work. Now I'm seeing the same thing happen to my Sixers."
"It's not just Russell. Theres others, like i mentioned reggie jackson as well and i agreed with someone who mentioned Morris. This post isnt to hate on westbrook."
Russell ? I wasnt aware LeBron had a close relation with Westbrook.
"I thought the Rockets would be legit title contenders. I think I was blinded by my love of Russell Westbrook and just the thought of them having both Westbrook and Harden, along with solid guys like Tucker and Gordon."
"*Since for whatever reason this thread is just regurgitating what his letter said as if this sub didn't vehemently hate Harden and the Rockets the last 6-7 years and the tweet makes it hard to read, here is the full letter:*  Dear Rockets fans,  Thank you for an amazing 14 years. Your love, support, and energy has meant the world to me.  My family and I came to Houston as yankees, nervous about how the city would welcome us and honored that [former owner] Leslie Alexander had trusted me to help run a legendary franchise. I came into an organization with Hall of Fame players Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady already in place and a championship legacy built by Houston legends like Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. Walking into work on the first day was exciting, daunting, and inspiring.  Soon enough, the nervousness washed away, and we came to feel like adopted Texans. What followed was the most amazing 14 years of my life. I could not imagine my good fortune to be surrounded by incredible people like Tad Brown, Carroll Dawson, Steve Clifford, Sam Hinkie, B.J. Johnson, Keith Jones, Dennis Lindsey, Tony Nila, Gersson Rosas, Rafael Stone, Tom Thibodeau, and Jeff Van Gundy. The bar was so high that when we added additional talent — such as Rick Adelman, Kenny Atkinson, JB Bickerstaff, Mike D’Antoni, Chris Finch, Sachin Gupta, Artūras Karnišovas, John Lucas, Kevin McHale, Monte McNair, Nick Nurse, Jimmy Paulis, and Eli Witus — it took forever to find them. It is a testament to the deep bench of talent the Rockets have always had that 11 of these people have gone on to become GMs or head coaches of their own teams. I am thankful to everyone I have worked with at the Rockets. There are far too many to list each of them by name. Our success was only because of you.  Thank you to Tilman, Paige, Michael, Patrick, Blayne, and Blake Fertitta. Your unwavering support and trust in me — from the moment you bought the team, and through both great and challenging times — is something I will never forget. With your leadership, and with the excellent people you have in place throughout the organization, there are championships in the Rockets’ future.  Thank you for the memories. I have so many. As a rookie GM, we started the season 15-17, and my nerves returned. We then went on a magical 22-game winning streak. The image of Rafer Alston going full Skip-2-My-Lou dribbling out the clock in front of Sasha Vujačić for win #22 will be etched forever in my memory. By 2009, we were able to add some of my all-time favorite players, such as Ron Artest, Shane Battier, Aaron Brooks, Chuck Hayes, Carl Landry, Kyle Lowry, Dikembe Mutombo, and Luis Scola, to the core of Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady. I can’t think of a better group of players and teammates. That team was unfortunately derailed by injuries. We remained a fun, hard-working group afterwards, but it did teach us what life was like without a superstar in the NBA. And then…  James Harden changed my life. An entire page could be dedicated just to James. He not only transformed my life, but he also revolutionized the game of basketball — and continues to do so — like almost no one has before. The game is played differently because of James, and on every playground in the world, the next generation of talent is studying and imitating his game. I can’t believe I won’t be able to have another strategy session with James. I loved working together on how to get his incredible Hall of Fame teammates Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, and Russell Westbrook to the Rockets. I will be rooting for James to win a championship for Houston. It’s how this story should end.  Finally, I want to say thank you again to the city of Houston and to all Rockets fans. Your support has kept me energized and inspired. You have been the driving force to our success. I am honored to have been a part of your story.  Sincerely, Daryl Morey"
His Majesty Russell Westbrook? Brodie getting promoted!
"Wilt, Hondo, Iverson, Bill Russell,  Jordan, Westbrook, Bird, Karl Malone, Oscar, and LeBron"
Russell Westbrook won MVP with the low seeded Thunder
"The NBA: Where ~~amazing~~ Pushoff-P gets to sort of push off to hit a 3 to tie, Jokic gets to take 5 steps on an in-bounds pass, and Wilson Chandler gets to bulldozes Jerami Grant, and Russell Westbrook falls asleep on defense happens."
Bad fit for LA if this guy doesn't shoot like he did last year. Pre 2019 shot stats made Russell Westbrook look like a good shooter.
"They did for Russell Westbrook when he got his triple double stats. He was not the best player by any means that year, but valuable to his team I would say hands down if you took him off that team they were probably bottom 5 in the league with out him."
I agree with you. I live in CLT and I’d be excited to go watch Russell Westbrook. Gordon Hayward has the opposite effect on me.
"Ah man I hate this argument, im sorry if im being rude but  Harden doesnt take every single shot in the game man.  Hes playing with Russell Fucking Westbrook at still averaged 36  There are plenty shots to go around, now, I'd rather flip Kemba for a better piece that doesnt need the ball and play Harden at PG but thats just me."
"Did i say that he has to be a #1 option tho? He could still contribute to a contender by being the main facilitator — think of the Clippers with Brody. Just because he has a bloated contract doesnt mean that he has to be relegated to a role player.   And no, im not disrespecting Caruso. He is a great role player — that’s it. Ive been high on Caruso before Bron went to the Lakers, but im not gonna think that he’s gonna contribute to a chip more than Russell Westbrook on a vacuum. One is an actual role player, while the other just made an all-star and all-nba selection as a guard."
Russell westbrook is better than bob pettit  now lmao
"The NBA has very complex salary rules. In my basic understanding, trades in the NBA need to have equal amounts of salary going each way. If you trade away players that are paid more, in some circumstances you can get a trade exception equal in value to the difference in salaries. The Celtics traded Gordon Hayward who makes a lot to the Hornets for players that don’t make as much, so they were able to get a trade exception equal to the difference in value (27 million). This trade exception is good for one year and let’s them trade for an expensive player on another team without send out the same amount of salary back. Ao if they wanted a player making 40 million like Russell Westbrook, they wiuld normally need to send Houston 40 million worth of contracts back. With the 27 million trade exception, they would only need to send back 13 million in contracts. Anyone with a better understanding should feel free to add to or correct what I’ve said."
Russell Westbrook with the absolute lockdown clutch defence.
"You’re neglecting that it’s a team game and fit on the team is so important, if I have a 20 win team Russell Westbrook is a lot better than Kyle Lowry, if I have a 60 win team the opposite is true"
Is Russell Westbrook not a scorer?
"You’re forgetting Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton, Paul George, russell Westbrook, John Wall, Kemba Walker, etc   I’d rather have Bam on a max that a large majority of other guys that have already signed their maxes."
What statistics prove that you are a top 15 player??  I also can give you Russell Westbrook statistics and make the case he is top 15 ever
&gt;You can't say Harden and Lillard aren't built to be number 1s when they haven't even come close to the end of their careers.  I sure can when their #2s are CJ McCollum and Russell Westbrook and they're both rapidly approaching 30 and are under contract for several more seasons.
"The Knicks were on pace for 6p wins well 59 and on pace for 33 when melo didnt play. Also melo created more of his own points. The thunder did win 60 wins but he didnt have Russell westbrook, kevin martin or Serge ibaka. Instead melo had 29 games of amare, 39 year old Jason Kidd and JR Smith as his best teammates"
Shifty Russell Westbrook.
"&gt;I think KD Kyrie PG Dame are next in some order, Kawhi with NB somewhere up there too since he’s their only big deal. (...) Shoe tech has hit a plateau a while ago, it’s just hype and marketing now   Yup. This is why Im saying DRose really missed out. Before his injury, he was arguably more marketable than even LeBron. ""The Return"" post-ACL tear had so much hype. Thats how big a story DRose was. Some people were in denial even when Butler took over the team. They still thought MVP Rose was possible. And its no surprise. Rose was far more electrifying than anyone today not named Steph Curry. Not to mention the Chicago thing.   I mean, his playstyle doesnt even look human. Its like if Russell Westbrook played with the finesse of Antawn Jamison, but at Westbrook's speed"
"As seriously talented as Russell Westbrook is, his triple double seasons were completely manufactured by the system the team was running. With his usage rate several other players would be extremely capable of putting up those numbers."
I’ve always accepted that Kobe didn’t deserve it then but then Russell Westbrook won an mvp by only stats and it annoyed me that Kobe didn’t get the same treatment.
"“Not talking about prime Russ” proceeds to mention his OKC playing days. Alright dude.   And if Russell Westbrook is seriously the best counter to Ja, he’s going to be fantastic. Peace"
"Bleacherreport lmfao   https://www.google.com/amp/s/oklahoman.com/article/3380690/thunder-selects-james-harden-with-the-third-overall-pick-in-the-nba-draft/amp  “The Thunder passed on Spanish point guard Ricky Rubio, who is widely considered the second best prospect behind former Oklahoma forward Blake Griffin. In doing so, Oklahoma City avoided a potential predicament in which the 18-year-old Spanish sensation likely would have moved Westbrook to shooting guard.  Rubio, who the Thunder showed increased interest in over the past week, was available to the Thunder when the Los Angeles Clippers used the first selection on Griffin and Memphis passed on the Rubio in favor of Connecticut center Hasheem Thabeet.”  ESPN analysis: “Analysis: The Thunder will have an easy choice here if Rubio is still on the board. Russell Westbrook can play off the ball, and he and Rubio would give the Thunder one of the best young backcourts in the NBA. Neither guy is a great shooter, but they have Kevin Durant for that.  If the Grizzlies take Rubio, Oklahoma City will have a tough choice between Thabeet and James Harden.”"
Eh Ja probably but I still don't trust his shot and I don't trust the John wall/Russell Westbrook strain of point guards in the playoffs
"In my opinion he’s a worse Russell Westbrook, and Westbrook’s play style is one of the most unpopular in the modern NBA. Combine that with character/motivation issues, although in this situation who knows if he has these if he stays healthy. His game won’t age well and I don’t think he’d have the determination to adapt to the post-Curry NBA"
So Russell Westbrook?
"Russell Westbrook is an all-time great.  His unique style of play, his role as a foundation player in a new city, his record-breaking and bar setting statistics. He has a dynamic sports story. Especially since he still has time for either a spectacular ring win or other compelling twist."
I'm more of a Russell Westbrook/Ja Morant type myself.
"D'Angelo Russell will not be a Top 20 NBA point guard next year  (Bron, Steph, Dame, Luka, Kyrie, Simmons, CP3, Lowry, Murray, Trae, Fox, Westbrook, Jrue, Kemba, SGA, Wall, Morant, Rose, Brogdon, Dragic.  If Lonzo / Conley / Rozier / Schroder overperform and some rookie breaks out he might not even be Top 25)"
He was trying to injure a player that is probably worth half a billion in Luka. Same with Beverly injuring Russell Westbrook. Honestly there should be more punishment for these type of plays.
"I'm assuming ""Russell"" is D-Lo and not Westbrook, since WB shoots with his right. Simmons, Harden, Zion is a scary big 3, although the lack of shooting is a little unfortunate. With all of the other great players, though, that's easily a championship team."
"Him, Tobias (basically everyone on the Sixers), I have high hopes for BI, I think Frank Nkitilia will show he’s got NBA chops, and Russell Westbrook will be insanely good. Dude put up 27/11/11 two months before the shutdown on good efficiency. He’s getting roasted for playing after he had COVID for a few weeks and a quad injury."
"Bad possession =/= wasted possession. Wasted possession = (1) turnover or(2) a shot so bad it’s as if the team didn’t get a shot off at all, such as Russell Westbrook having to take a step back fadeaway 3 over 2 defenders at the end of the shot clock"
"I never said one was a better rebounded than the other,   You said that Luka actually battles for boards unlike Russell.   Statistics show that they battle for rebounds about the same amount. I’m sure if Luka wanted to battle for more rebounds he probably could because he is a lot bigger than Westbrook is, but claiming that Westbrook doesn’t battle for rebounds when stats show he typically grabs a higher % of contested rebounds directly proves that claim to be wrong."
"&gt; Russell Westbrook asked his thoughts about being picked on LeBron’s team, thought he was the last pick. **Informed it was just an alphabetical list**, he made sure to correct Melo who was heckling nearby."
"For a guy like belinelli, I think he just wasn't comfortable in the American structure, and just didn't want to be great. He didn't want to put himself through the rigors to achieve another level and simply plateaued. The potential is definitely there though.  Hell, I thought Brook Lopez had the potential to be the next Tim Duncan after watching him in college. Was pretty wrong about that one.  The one I was spot-on about though was Russell Westbrook. I watched him at UCLA and knew his ceiling was higher than nearly anyone I'd ever seen from where he started. I was the only one saying he would be MVP of the NBA and people thought I was nuts. I'm still mad that he plateaued as well. He was too selfish and bullheaded to inch to that very next level."
"I love how in a series with CP3, Russell Westbrook and James Harden the most talked about playing was Lu Dort."

So you actually think that Rubio isn’t better at diming dudes up than Russell.   LeBron Trae Luka Harden Ja CP3 Ben Simmons Lowry Westbrook Rubio Dame  Those are all dudes who have better passing vision than Russell. Have you watched them? That’s not even getting into the lead ballhandler that can score better than him.   Jesus you guys are dumb.
As well as Russell Westbrook and Josh Hart
I mainly play 2k20 on the switch. I built a Russell Westbrook type built.
You could have put a garbage can vs prime Russell Westbrook and most people would choose the garbage can lol.
"This is the first year he’s leading the team, so we don’t know what his production is going to be. Also, no one else on the team might be averaging above 16+ ppg (I hope someone does though).   OKC has a sophomore Kevin Durant averaging 20+ and a rookie Russell Westbrook with a team of nobodies and they only made it to 13th in the West. With how stacked the West is this year, I wouldn’t be surprised if they did really, REALLY bad, even if SGA is a good player."
"I didn’t say Boston was a gross organization. You’re just being a child.   Get off your high horse with the spreadsheet shit. You’ve given me literally no justification for why you think Tatum is the better prospect going forward. All you’ve said is that he’s played more playoff games (which is also a number). So has Jaylen Brown. So what. Justify your position. Why do you think this?  What is this grown men shit? Tatum is 22? You don’t need to be grizzled veteran with years of playoff experience to win a title. You mentioned Duncan. How old was he? Magic? Bird? Kareem? Wade?  You’re acting like Luka put up empty stats on a bad team. He’s not Al Jefferson. He’s not a stat hoarder. The Mavericks had the best offensive efficiency in league history last year. He makes everyone around him better. The Mavericks won almost as many games as the Celtics last year despite being far less talented and in a far stronger conference, while missing their second best player for significant time. This shit about stat hoarders is nonsense. It’s a strawman. If Luka is a stat hoarder, then Jordan was. He won the scoring title every year he won the title. LeBron’s usage rate is pretty ridiculous and he stuffs the box score and it’s worked out pretty well for him.   Kobe’s 81 point game was close at the start of the 4th. His insane 4th quarter put it away. His team didn’t win anything that season because Lamar Odom and Smush Parker were the teams 2nd and 3rd best players. It’s weird to me that you include Kobe here, because when he had talent around him he was incredible and won titles. Are you saying he was a stat hoarder? Because I think you’re arguing against yourself their bud.  It’s clear from the way you talk about Kobe and Westbrook and Chamberlain that you’re one of those people who think individual players are solely responsible for the success or failure of their team. The talent around a player matters. Bill Russell was incredible, but I think having a roster full of Hall of Famers to complement him had more to do with his success than some inherent weakness on Chamberlain’s part.  Til;dr strawman strawman strawman"
"You don’t judge players from previous seasons? Lmao if a front office went solely off the most current seasons when evaluating players, you would end up with a team that gives up Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook thinking they upgraded their team.   Oh wait..."
"Bro Jeremy Lin had a faster 40 time than John Wall and Russell Westbrook, but gets called “sneaky athletic” BECAUSE people think Asians aren’t as athletic as black people"
Russell Westbrook taking 46 shots in game 6 against Utah in 2018.      Russell Westbrook taking 18 fourth quarter shots in game 4 vs Houston in 2017.

They’re just so stacked they needed to be included in the main list.
"Like I said, I understand why you’re doing it; I’m a Russell Westbrook fan, so I can relate to where you’re coming from re: shit takes.  But the outlook of that trade will persist for years."
"I haven’t been to many 76ers games, but the one of the ones I did go to was the one where Embiid dunked on Russell Westbrook and then stared him down. That game didn’t end well but still."
"People keep talking about John Wall for Griffin or John Wall for Russell Westbrook, but wouldn't Russ for Blake straight up make the most sense?"
"Ben Simmons, DeMar DeRozan, Giannis, Westbrook... at shooting 3s  Wiggins, Javale, Westbrook... At bball IQ  Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Irving, Bertans, Lou Williams, Lavine, DAngelo Russell... Defense  CP3... size  Kawhi... Leadership  Whiteside... Effort"
"They can if they pose a significant attacking threat similar to Russell Westbrook. He was horseshit tier from mid and long-range for his entire career but was an MVP level player at his peak, even rivaling Kevin Durant in terms of impact during some of those OKC playoff runs."
Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook, DeRozan and go from there."
"Just watch literally every Russell Westbrook, Giannis, Magic, or Lebron game ever"
"Michael Jordan has never been about losing. He has never tanked, and the only reason we got the 3rd pick was pure luck. We finished 9th/10th in the East last year with a 6.7% chance of the 3rd pick and lucked into it. Originally, MJ wanted to trade for Russell Westbrook, but I imagine Mitch Kupchak (our GM) convinced him to take LaMelo Ball instead if he was available. Since he was, I'm guessing Gordon Hayward for the ""compromise"" for not getting Russ.  Michael Jordan may have not played in almost 20 years, but he still has the same exact competitive winning edge he did back then. Unfortunately, it has hurt our franchise more than helped. Also, we have to overpay to get guys to come here. How many NBA players actually want to play here (even the guys *from* the Carolinas), so overpaying in free agency is the only way right now."
Bawh Gawd that's a Russell Westbrook sized exception /s
"John wall,  Russell westbrook, maybe even blake all worse."
"Flair checks out.  Rank Ingram among these players who were voted all-stars: Harden, LeBron, Doncic, Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, Donavan Mitchell, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert.  Currently, at absolute best, he's still bottom of the pack, ahead of Gobert and maybe Westbrook (Westbrook will get in off name recognition anyways).  It would be plausible that Oladipo never makes an all-star game again.  Calling D'Angelo Russell a fringe all-star is an incredible compliment to where he stands in the league's hierarchy.  Ingram definitely has the best chance to ascend to a point of being a consistent all-star, but at this point all 3 of them are, yes, fringe all stars."
Or Russell Westbrook the Mouth Breather?
"James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, John Wall, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, DeMar DeRozan, Victor Oladipo, Kyle Lowry.  I'll be very, very impressed if Fox somehow makes it."
In KD's fourth season he was 22 years old and led the Thunder to the WCF (lost to the Mavs who won the finals that year).    At the time Russell Westbrook was in his third season and he averaged 22/8/4 with 4 turnovers a game. James Harden was in his second season and averaged 12/3/2 a game.  KD on the other hand averaged 28/7/3.   Just because Harden is the player he is now and Westbrook went on to win a MVP does not mean that the 2010-2011 Thunder were a superteam.
I’m sure Philly is dying to get noted 3p shooter and floor spacer Russell Westbrook.  Morey did a lot of work to fix some of those roster issues the 76ers had. Let him do his thing.
There are Rockets fans who think Russell Westbrook doesn't know how to play with a center. And they also think John Wall is better than Russ.  Wow.
Why? What exactly does Russell Westbrook give them?
Russell Westbrook &amp; Wussell Restbrook
Is Russell Westbrook dumb LeBron?
"You're arguing that  Russell Westbrook is ""trash"" because the OKC (with KD as their leader) lost to the Warriors after being down 3-1. You also believe Kevin Durant is ""flat out better"" than LeBron James because Warriors swept Cavs.  I can't argue with that logic. I rest my case."
"Russell Westbrook,  D'Angelo Russell,  Cazzie Russell,  Campy Russell,  Bill Russell"

"Guards in the west that will have better numbers then him: Steph, Lillard, CP3, Ja, Murray, Harden, Luka, Mitchell, Kawhi, PG, Booker, Ingram, Russell, and Westbrook."
Basically everything Russell Westbrook related for the past four years
Question is is how much they want to pay Russell Westbrook when trading George.   I'd say that that is low.
"In terms of tiers, I see it as:  Tier 1 Goat: MJ, Lebron, Kareem  Tier 2 NBA Cornerstones: Magic, Bird, Wilt, Russell, Shaq, Hakeem, Duncan, Kobe  Tier 3 Transcendent: Steph, KD, Oscar, West, Dr. J, KG, David Robinson  Tier 4 All-time Greats: Nash, Harden, Westbrook, Kawhi, Melo, IT, CP3  Not an all-inclusive list, but that's roughly how I see it shaking out."
"Russell Westbrook | Welcome to the Clippers | Skills, Tricks, Dunks and Assists | 2008-2020 | HD 4K   &amp;nbsp;  Formula for another playoff disappointment."
I actually thought at first he was comparing Wilt to Russell Westbrook and came in to lose my shit.

If it does happen I feel that there is 100% chance that Russell Westbrook will be the involved

Ultimate karma that 3 MVPs left Oklahoma shitty. If Seattle never left they would have been the rival this past entire decade to the warriors. It would have been like 2016 okc warriors except it woulda been EVERY SEASON   Russell wilson...ruaeel westbrook....the connections don't stop lol.....Seattle and the nba community was absolutely fucking robbed
"You don't understand the fear in our hearts when we heard Russell Westbrook might come to NY, this is the best possible outcome"
"No no no no no no no no no...   The dubs don't need to forfeit the future for the beard. Also, don't do business with the rockets and Tillman, fuck that guy.   Let James Harden and Russell Westbrook take a collective 60 shots a game and get bumped in round one.   As a dubs fan I don't want Russ or Harden on my team. They aren't good leaders, team players, or winners. Bleh... Trust the process, just because the warriors are being slept on doesn't mean the youth can't and won't step up."
"Ya bro it's not a hot take, but people do give him a quite large pass for his war crimes. But he's still seen as a massive dissapoint. I think only reason it's ok is because despite our society's standards - ""it is okay to not be better than MJ"". That, and that Vince also really took 2nd half of his career in his own hands and transitioned into 5 different levels of role player. Whereas people have waited 12 years for LBJ to not look inhuman anymore. Blake for example gets way less hate now that he's injury prone. And Russell Westbrook only gets hate because he makes a supermax $40M+, that makes any flaw stand out. Vince quit on Toronto but at least he wasn't an asshole or a whiner later on."
"True, but I imagine if the Sixers starting point was Paul George and Russell Westbrook instead of Andrew Bynum their rebuild would've looked alot different"
37 year old russell westbrook will be quite the draw for you guys
Incoming russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook, regardless of the team he's on, will have a ""bounce back"" season. I say that in quotes because he averaged 27/8/7 on 47% shooting. Which was a career high from him.  I mean he'll return to MVP form, shoot average from 3 and the line."
The disrespect to [SuperSonics legend Russell Westbrook...](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/76/3f/a3/763fa35ce96e5f3ee6122ffab21665c7.jpg)
"If healthy, Gordo is 3x the player that Tobias is. Tobias caps out as a decent 3 and d wing, who isn’t a top tier defender and doesn’t take many 3’s. Hayward tops out as a borderline all star who can make plays for others on offense.   Don’t get me wrong, I hate the contract, but the Tobias deal is another level of bad. John Wall, Russell Westbrook, and Kevin Love all have worse contracts as well."
It always comes back to Russell Westbrook huh.
"Trae young, luka, Russell westbrook love his passion and how he gave a lot of money to disney bubble staff, boban, Stephen curry and klay Thompson."
"I think if you put David Robinson in this era and since they are both big men who do you think would be better? I'm putting my money on Giannis due to his versitility on defense which is mostly what centers do nowadays but I could see Giannis being even better back then with the rules because now you can play zone which is how you stop Giannis since Bud is stupid and Giannis should play in the post and inside and near baseline instead of being on the perimeter and do kinda the same thing like you do with Russell Westbrook just sag off him but the only difference being instead of just sagging off him you also need multiple defenders to be ready since Giannis can drive through, between or over a single defender unlike Westbrook who can't but with multiple it's much harder for him, I think that Giannis hasn't been used right and his potential is much higher than what most people think even if his jumpshot doesn't get to an elite level. Just post up more, become more active in the Pick and roll, off ball screens and cut to the basket more will unleash the true monster in Giannis. I have watched footage and you don't see him getting many lobs thrown to him but imagine if he was cutting and rolling to the basket like AD and the alley oops would just keep coming, he's quicker, faster, I'm going to say he's stronger than AD too (but I think AD is better at handling strength in the post on defense due to him being a little bit heavier but I do think Giannis is stronger when driving and knocking defenders away like nothing), he has a higher vertical, he is an inch taller, his wingspan should be as long if not longer but hasn't been measured since his rookie year when it was at 7'3 but we can tell it's definetely more than that and his hands are way bigger."
"The Sixers started The Process with Jrue and Iggy. The Thunder started it with Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Steven Adams. Not to mention leftover assets from previous trades, whilst the 6ers were barren and were dealt a bad hand with Bynum.  Since OKC start with a much better initial standpoint, they were not only able to acquire more draft capital, but they've also acquired a young stud in Shai. We literally started from the bottom, with no hope, no great assets. Hinkie turned that into 2 potential Superstars and we managed to get not 1, but 2 franchise players.  The Process until Hinkie was driving it was a huge success. We have hope now. Yes, Thunder's process has more potential. But Hinkie's Process will forever be the one that had the greatest effect in terms of magnitude. We got an elite coaching department that wanted to work with our 2 stars. We got an elite POBO that wanted the same. Hinkie single-handedly saved the franchise from irrelevancy."
"Sorry, a more acute title should've been ""Why has Russell Westbrook forgotten how to shoot as consistently as he did in the first nine years of his career, as compared to his three point and free throw shooting percentages in the previous three seasons?""  Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue does it?"
"&gt; So how would you compare Paul gasol to a chris Paul or Westbrook, I think most would agree they are.    1. Westbrook is far worse now than Gasol was from 2008-10  2. The Lakers never had to run into the Warriors   &gt; Are chris paul and Westbrook better than Jason terry and 40 yr old Jason kidd?   2020 Russell Westbrook is far from the play he was three seasons ago. He’s inefficient and can’t keep the Rockets afloat in Harden’s absence.   &gt; Clearly they are, so like I said yall keep making excuses, the winners just get the job done.   Except they wouldn’t have gotten it done if they had ran into the Warriors. Harden had the misfortune of having his prime coincide with them.   &gt; So that argument holds no water And you guys love to assume you wouldve won that game 7, you guys are absolutely sure you wouldve won.  even though you yourself said they were playing against the most talented team ever, with a proven playoff track record of coming back from multiple game deficits.    First of all, I said they “likely” would have won the series. They were a 65 win team that was up 3-2 and had two chances to seal the series, with one of them being at home.  And the only deficit the Durant Warriors ever came back from was being down 3-2 to Houston after Paul went down."
"What a completely asinine thing to say. Without FT’s he’d still lead the league in scoring by 3.4 ppg, that difference is the same as 2nd place Giannis and 19th place Russell Westbrook."
They don't. They just make up bullshit.   Russell WestBrook hasn't played a back to back yet and no one is bitching about it. Because no one notices and people don't care.
I was fucking around on BBRef earlier and did a query to see who had the most games under 40 FG% in the last 10 years. I was surprised to see Conley in the top 10 and it made his struggles this season a lot more understandable.

Khris Middleton is better than Russell Westbrook...? I gotta get off this sub man y’all disrespect Russ way too much
"No it's not lol. Their defense isn't good enough and you aren't going anywhere with Russell ""23% from three"" Westbrook as your second best player."
Both Russell Westbrook and James Harden will be high once it's all said and done.
Honestly Westbrook’s argument is mostly that he’s Russell Westbrook. If Donovan Mitchell/Booker and Russ swapped stats would you be pushing for Mitchell/Booker to get in?
"Luka, Harden, LBJ, Kawhi, AD (starters)  Lillard, Jokic, Mitchell, Gobert (good chance at making it over Booker)  Ingram (since he's a frontcourt player)  KAT (at flex spot, if he ever comes back any time soon)  PG13 (wildcard flex, he's missed a ton of time though)  So if these above 12 are the All-Stars, we still have other guys  CP3 and Russell Westbrook.  DDR, McCollum, Lou Williams, Montrez Harrell, and Capela are long-shots, but they won't make it.  So Booker has to beat either PG13, CP3, and Russell Westbrook, or beat 2 of the 3 and hope KAT misses a lot of time."
"And so Russell Westbrook avg 10 assists and 10 rebounds a game doesn’t contribute to his team winning correct? Somehow one of the most inefficient shooters of all time has managed to carry teams to the playoffs over and over again, and even managed to win the MVP. But we’ll just ignore everything else he does on the floor cuz that gets to fit your mental narrative that he’s a bad player.   Lets not look at the absolute blazing pace he can push the ball with. Lets not look at his black hole level gravity on the floor. His ability to beat almost anyone off the dribble and slash open a defense. Lets not understand how he’s good, and instead parrot 50% TS cuz that’s somehow the only stat that matters, even though this guys missed the playoffs once in his career."
Dunn and Pat Bev over Lowry and Bledsoe IMO  Before you quote Russell Westbrook on me the advanced stats love Bev’s defense too
"Russell Westbrook has the worst breaths per 36 of any player, what a bum"
"The proof is the team defensive rating and the record.   And even then that isn't narrative. Narrative is a storyline based decision. Like the Russell Westbrook MVP. Or the Kawhi/Iggy FMVP. What storyline was I pointing to for AD's candidacy?   The media anecdote was me crediting Richard Jefferson for noticing something with the Lakers as a whole that I noticed AD taking part in.   &gt;lines about him “locking in”  If anything you could say my original comment didn't provide proof of him doing this. But me saying he's locking in select situations isn't a ""narrative.""  And here's some numbers to back up what I was saying. Of players who played 12 ""Clutch"" games. AD is 4th in defensive rating. The players in front of him are Brook Lopez, Giannis, and Danny Green. Two of those players are being bouyed by their teammates. Brook Lopez is being bouyed by Giannis and DG is being bouyed by AD.  https://stats.nba.com/players/clutch-advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1"

Zach Lavine   I think Fox is a top 11–18ish point guard. He is in a tier with Bledsoe, Murray, Dragic, Conley, Dinwiddie, etc. Not quite top 10 material yet, but he has the potential to be."
"Sure, but he’s averaging this over a little less than half a season and has a career 54% true shooting. His single highest season before this was 55.5 percent true shooting, which is pretty average. Players have major fluctuations like this all the time, but it takes at least three seasons for me to be truly convinced by statistics alone that a player has truly improved and isn’t just on the high end of their own personal distribution curve for a stretch.   Here’s an example. Is Russell westbrook a 34 percent shooter, or a 22 percent shooter? Or he is a 29 percent shooter. He shot 34 in his mvp season. He’s been significantly worse since then. Did he forget how to shoot? Or his he really a 29 percent shooter but has had seasons lower and higher than that?   Demar derozan is a good player but he is not a super star and probably never will be. He’s having a good season but I sincerely doubt we will see a continued streak over multiple years of him maintaining 60 percent true shooting while shooting very few threes and taking several mid range shots. This isn’t to knock mid range shots. But nobody can deny the value of three point shooting in this league. I’ll honestly be surprised if he even maintains 60 percent true shooting for this whole season"
He said only Russell Westbrook can stop Kevin Durant.
"https://www.nba.com/article/2017/04/12/blogtable-what-criteria-matters-most-making-mvp-decision      &gt;Shaun Powell: In this particular case: Have I seen it done before? And the answer is: I""ve seen what Harden did before, seen what LeBron did before, seen what Kawhi did before. I've never seen a guy average a triple double. And I don't understand why this is even a debate.      &gt;John Schuhmann: My vote went to the individual who had the biggest effect on why a good team was good. That was the guy averaging 29 points and 11 assists for the No. 2 offense in the league. The Rockets had the league's third-best record primarily because of their offense, and James Harden put up historical numbers running the show.      &gt;Ian Thomsen: I love this award because it’s all about value: who has done the most for his team? Which is why, in my view, LeBron James is usually the player to beat. It has taken extraordinary numbers by Harden and Westbrook to beat out LeBron. In the end, as much as Westbrook has done for the Thunder, I believe Harden has done a little bit more.      &gt;Lang Whitaker: I'm doing my best to keep it simple: Value. I'm trying to vote for the player in the NBA who is the most valuable. (FWIW, I also hate that whoever you choose is somehow also seen as a total rejection of the other candidates. I can appreciate greatness on multiple fronts!) And you can throw new-fangled stats and numbers at me and summon the Fun Police on me if you want, but to me there was no player in the NBA who was more valuable to his team and his teammates (and fans of the game, if you want to include the entertainment factor) this season than Russell Westbrook.       It's not that weird of a concept to say a lot of voters don't think about defense. Two guys interviewed there mentioned defense and one of those still went Harden/Westbrook."
"We may not have a chip like Cleveland, but we watched winning basketball in OKC for basically a decade straight and have what looks to be another decade of winning basketball ahead of us. We’ve watched stars like James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and Kyle Singler wear the letters OKC on their chest. It aint a chip, but it’s a solid consolation prize."
Royce just tweeted it:    https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1216918133191139333  &gt;SGA has the 148th triple-double in Thunder history. Russell Westbrook has 138 of those.
Russell Westbrook type beat.
"You said DPOY-level defence is never used as an argument. That’s why I quoted it. That’s blatantly untrue and any number of MVP winners make it extremely obvious that defence is taken into consideration.  Being the clear best player on a top 3-5 team in the league is an absolute necessity if your name isn’t Russell Westbrook. Beyond that, a player’s total contribution is very obviously taken into account, *including defence*."
Russell Westbrook was right lol
Westbrook  Rose  Melo  Lebron  Embiid  6man: Dame or Deangelo Russell
Russell Westbrook if he didn’t chuck threes?
"I was curious to see how Russell Westbrook affected the rockets passing. They're dead last in the nba at 241.5 passes per game. But last year they were second to last with 246 passes per game. With Harden being the primary scorer, Westbrook probably doesn't affect this stat too much, but I wonder if Westbrook was the primary play maker for a new team how much affect it would have then?"
"I'm basically the opposite. When I play pickup, I try to play with the intensity of Russell Westbrook mixed with Pat Beverly, but I end up having an asthma attack about 30 seconds in...."
"This seems like a fun exercise. I'll take a stab at it.  Point Guard.  **(1) Stephen Curry** - He's #1 for now but the last time he balled out as his team's undisputed #1 was four years ago. If he doesn't come back strong, then then his position at the top starts to become contentious.  **(2) Russell Westbrook** - Top 3 playmaker in the league, crazy at pushing the pace, one of the best rebounders in the league, elite kick and drive game, has a history of going off for 40+ points  **(3) CP3** - Has shown he can still deliver if he plays in a team geared to his strengths. However, is injury prone and has lost a step.  **(4) Damian Lillard** - Is the most proven of all the other score-first guards in the league so he's fourth by default.  **(5) Kemba Walker** - Less flashier than Kyrie but is more of a team player and provides more effort on D  **(6) Trae Young** - Only reason I'm not putting him in the top 5 is because the Hawks have been absolute trash. Potentially the greatest offensive guy in this list.  **(7) Kyle Lowry** - Is a reliable floor general who's just all-around good at everything. Doesn't get the respect he deserves tbh.  **(8) Kyrie Irving** - He really showed his limitations on the Celtics last year. He's entertaining as fuck but isn't a great playmaker or a consistent elite scorer yet. I need to see more from him.  **(9) Ben Simmons** - He's fantastic at everything but shooting. Unfortunately, he's the 5th scoring option when everyone's healthy so his opportunities to demonstrate what he can fully do as a top is limited  **(10) Malcom Brogdon** - Is emerging as a top notch floor general too. Great length and can't wait to see him alongside Dipo  Shooting Guard.  **(1) James Harden** - He's a one-man-offence. Pass him the ball and stand on the perimeter is a legit winning strategy. 38ppg is absurd.  **(2) Klay Thompson** - Elite shooter. Top notch defender. Doesn't need to handle the ball. Would start for literally every franchise in the league.  **(3) Luka Doncic** - It's weird. I think he's a better player than Klay but not a better SG lol. His NBA career has gotten off to a great start but his impact against elite teams takes a severe dip and I don't know how he'd perform in the playoffs.   **(4) Devin Booker** - Is in the loaded Western Conference where most of the best guards play so gets a lot of disrespect. However if you use your eyes, it's obvious that he's a supremely talented fella.  **(5) Donovan Mitchell** - His solid defence makes up for the usual efficiency complaints. Has shown an increased playmaking capacity in Conley's absence.  **(6) Bradley Beal** - Considering he's in his 8th season, I don't think he's done enough to be in the top 5. I don't really see why he's a lot of people's #2 either.  **(7) Victor Oladipo** - If he returns to his pre-injury form, then he's basically a top 5 staple. A ball-handling bucket getter who plays great defence.  **(8) Jrue Holiday** - Watching Jrue clamp up a great guard is one of the most exhilarating things in the NBA. He's also good for 20ppg.  **(9) Zach Lavine** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(10) Demar Derozan** - Is the gatekeeper for a top 10 SG imo. Has shown he can handle being a #1 guy but isn't clutch and hasn't developed his 3pt game since leaving Toronto.  Small Forward  **(1) Lebron James** - Kawhi coasts too much in the regular season for him to seriously challenge for this position. Still The King for now.  **(2) Kawhi Leonard** - Incredible two-way guy who is unguardable when hot. His questionable health prevents him from being #1.  **(3) Kevin Durant** - Absurdly good scorer. Can get a bucket in a multitude of ways. But he's third because he's not an elite defender and people who shed their skin once a month are creepy.  **(4) Jimmy Butler** - Jimmy G Buckets. The G stands for Gets. He's a closer, a good on-ball defender and a great team player.  **(5) Paul George** - I think he had a career year in 2019 because Russ decided to defer to him as a top scoring option. He's a streaky guy who's not as good a shot-creator as the top three guys in this list. I think him and Jimmy are very close tbh.  **(6) Khris Middleton** - Isn't marketable. Plays in a small market. Overshadowed by his MVP teammate. Still a good sharpshooting two-way guy who is reliable at what he does.  **(7) Tobias Harris** - When you consider how valuable excellent wings are, then Tobias and Khris' contracts make a lot more sense. These guys are in the tier below some of the greatest players in the league. Tobias is just another good all-around dude.  **(8) Bojan Bogdanovic** - Insanely efficient scorer and has been doing it longer than the guys in the next two positions.  **(9) Brandon Ingram** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(10) Jaylen Brown** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.   Power Forward:  **(1) Giannis Antetokounmpo** - is a force of nature.  **(2) Anthony Davis** - Most obvious #2 in any position lol.  **(3) Pascal Siakam** - Is currently in his breakthrough year but needs to maintain his form against top teams. Will make All-NBA this year.  **(4) Draymond Green** -Is fantastic at everything but scoring.  **(5) LaMarcus Aldridge** - Game is passing him by but he's still delivering.  **(6) Blake Griffin** - was very good last year but he needs to stay healthy  **(7) Kristaps Porzingis** - Ihas been very good this year but he needs to stay healthy.  **(8) Jayson Tatum** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(9) PJ Tucker** -Mr Iron-man. Great defender. Good shooter. Elite-tier role player.  **(10) Marcus Morris** - is currently shooting 47% from three in January. He made my top 10 on that alone lol.   Center:  **(1) Joel Embiid** - Can put up 27/13 while providing DPOY level defence. Can be a monster against anyone not named Gasol.  **(2) Rudy Gobert** - Averages 15 points while being maybe the best defender in the league. It's very close between him and Jokic.  **(3) Nikola Jokic** - Arguably the best playmaking center of all-time. I don't rate him that much on defence though. It's very close between him and Gobert.  **(4) Karl Anthony Towns** -Excellent offensive force but he's a negative defender in one of the most crucial positions. He needs to improve on that front.  **(5) Nikola Vucevic** - Doesn't get the attention he deserves because of small market. He's a 20/10 guy who's a top defender.  **(6) Deandre Ayton** - This kid is a stud but people don't know it yet because he's bad at peeing.  **(7) Bam Adebayo** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(8) Clint Capela** - Kinda how I'd imagine Drummond to play on a good team.  **(9) Andre Drummond** - Has never had a good guard/roster to play with but has managed to impress regardless. I reckon he could take a major leap forward within the right system. I really hopes he goes to the Hawks.   **(10) Josef Nurkic** - Trailblazers fan will @ me if I omit him so Nurkic gets the #10 spot by default. Sorry Sabonis."
"You're right, I have been enlightened. 2017-2018 Paul George who initially didn't even make the all star team because he was having an atrocious first half of the season and in many games during his funk played third fiddle to Westbrook AND Carmelo Anthony, was actually better than Russell Westbrook who averaged 25/10/10."

"""He don't guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing."" -Russell Westbrook"
"my dude.  i completely understand the reasoning behind Stockton often getting overlooked whenever these kinds of discussions take place, but homie is 100% top 25.    a few quick bullet points:  \- he's the ALL-TIME leader in 2 of the 5 most important statistical categories in NBA History (assists and steals)  \- his lead over 2nd place all-time in both categories (jason kidd) looks like a typo.    **-** He has a lead of over **37-hundred assists** over second place on the all-time list.  To put that in context, Russell Westbrook lead the NBA in assists this last season with 784.  **That means Stockton has a lead greater THAN FOUR LEAGUE LEADING SEASONS OF ASSISTS.** He has 31% more assists than the guy in second place.  \- He has a lead of over **600 steals** over second place all-time (again Jason Kidd).  Paul George lead the NBA last season in steals with 170.  **Meaning Stockton has a lead of nearly FOUR LEAGUE LEADING SEASONS OF STEALS.**  \- 10x All-Star  \- 11x All-NBA  \- 5x All Defensive Team   \- In 19-seaons he missed 22 games due to injury.  Let me repeat that, in **19 SEASONS, HE MISSED 22 GODDAMN GAMES DUE TO INJURY.**    \- His team never missed the playoffs and he lead them to Back-to-Back Finals Appearances.  \- It's the steals and assists that get most of the attention (understandably so).  But he's also **45th all-time in points scored**.  That puts him ahead of D Wade, Scottie Pippen, Isiah Thomas, Steve Nash and Magic Johnson.  I've been following the league for almost 4-decades and again I understand the reasoning behind the lack of love that Stockton gets, but the numbers simply don't lie.    This dude does a real nice job recapping what made him the GOAT PG:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvv8giVEgG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvv8giVEgG4)  Peace and Love from Tokyo my friend!"
"Westbrook was just as bad if not worse. I know your teams fans hate KD but it is absolutely not debatable that he was better than Westbrook for his entire tenure at OKC.  I find it funny that KD gets blamed for carrying the team to the WCF and losing, meanwhile Russell is somehow praised? for not being able to get past the 2nd round lol"
Russell Westbrook. Plays every game like it's his last. He's awesome
"When looking at amount of points and career TS% at 31 years old, Russ is in good company.  ||||Crit|Crit| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Player|From|To|PTS|TS%| |Wilt Chamberlain|1960|1968|25434|.538| |Vince Carter|1999|2008|16592|.536| |Dominique Wilkins|1983|1991|18796|.536| |LaMarcus Aldridge|2007|2017|15136|.534| |Gary Payton|1991|2000|13485|.534| |Russell Westbrook|2009|2020|19670|.528| |Tracy McGrady|1998|2011|18108|.519| |John Wall|2011|2019|10879|.519| |Chris Webber|1994|2005|14945|.518| |Isiah Thomas|1982|1993|17966|.517| |Allen Iverson|1997|2007|20824|.515|"

"Yes that's the point of the original post buddy. Westbrook started the season with an injured finger and had just undergone knee surgery. His shooting percentages were far below his career shooting percentages which are already bad (but justifiable due to his major contributions in most other aspects of the game).   Now that the Rockets are close to fully healthy and Russ doesn't have to jack up bad shots because he doesn't want to drive hard to the rim to try create an open 3 for a team that's shooting barely over 20% from 3 -  he's back to playing his best basketball, hence why OP used a recent sample to show that after the bad start to the season, Russell Westbrook is no longer playing bad, and is now playing good.  But sure, just ignore context and pick whatever stats you want to fit your narrative ;) If Westbrook regresses majorly from this sample and starts to hurt the Rockets production, you can come back here and brag about being right :) at this moment in time, you can argue 'small sample' but I can also argue your sample is being affected by a lot of significant factors that you're choosing to ignore such as Westbrook's injuries + Rockets not being healthy and being ice cold from 3 forcing Russ to take more shots."
"Record matters a ton in the bench selections, if you’re the #2 or #3 seed you usually get two allstars.  Also who’s making it over him? Lillard, Luka, and Harden are locks. Minimum of four guards, I’d take Mitchell over Westbrook, and that leaves who else to replace him? Booker? Russell? Even if Westbrook is picked over him there’s still two flex spots. Unlikely he isn’t selected"
Russell Westbrook has 1423 more points than Chris Paul despite playing in 135 fewer games
Thunder fans are starting to realize CP3 might be better than Russell Westbrook.

Except theres no way Russell Westbrook misses the allstar game. Ingram wont make it
"&gt; Russell Westbrook's last 14 games: 54.4 TS%   &gt; ”Since December 9th, Westbrook is averaging 55.4 TS%”  This is the most impressive thing to me.  League average is currently 55.8TS%, so Russ is basically a league average shooter.  Russ does lots of other amazing stuff on the court, and if he can shoot some where close to respectable and control his turnovers, that makes the Rockets a formidable team int he playoffs."
I agree and wouldn't mind someone on a better team making it like Malcolm Brogdon out East or Russell Westbrook or Rudy Gobert out West.
Its a pretty commonly held belief.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-should-be-mad-at-kevin-durant-durant-stuck-him-with-all-the-work/  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/oklahoma-city-thunder-kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-mvp-051616

I really fuck with Russell Westbrook and James Harden as a duo in my head but like James Harden needs to be the shooting guard not the one.
"It’s for sure changed.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/nba--patrick-beverley-didn-t-want-to-hurt-russell-westbrook--but-not-apologizing-for-play-060139676.html  This is the second google result for Patrick Beverly 2013. People hated on this dude constantly but when he joined the Clippers, suddenly he goes from dirty player to scrappy underdog and it feels like everyone decided to forget what they said about him for years."
Here will be the guard candidates for all-nba  James Harden (Lock)  Luka Doncic (Lock)  Damian Lillard (Lock)  Kemba Walker (Lock)    This leaves two spots for the following:  Trae Young  Bradley Beal  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Kyle Lowry  Kyrie Irving  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook   Personally I’d give it to Lowry and Kyrie.

"the team he would be leaving doesn't have another MVP caliber player (Russell Westbrook) so basically I feel like that would be significantly less *Snake Like* on Giannis's part idk . . . this combined with what everybody else said and nah, Giannis would have a chill transition going to GSW imo"
"Russell Westbrook is playing great for the Rockets, on 24 points, 7 assists and 8 rebounds yet he gets no credit, due to James Harden’s outstanding performances."
I will always upvote a Russell Westbrook highlight idc if it’s a video of him plowing my wife shits getting upvoted
Does that mean Wilt or Oscar Robertson &gt; LeBron? or Russell Westbrook was the best player the last 3 years? or Luka is better than LeBron right now?  Bron fans always bringing up stats like that’s the only thing that matters
"Russell Westbrook, Pat Bev and Embiid."
I think I'd take D'angelo Russell over Westbrook
"I wouldn’t consider Luka any more of a point guard than Simmons, though neither guy is really what I’d consider a point guard so I’m just going to list everyone that is listed as a PG in B-ball Ref.   In order :   LeBron James  Steph Curry  Luka Doncic   Damian Lillard  Kyrie Irving   Chris Paul  Kyle Lowry  Kemba Walker   Ben Simmons   De’Aaron Fox  Russell Westbrook   Mike Conley Jr.  Malcolm Brogdon   Spencer Dinwiddie   Goran Dragic"
"Posting some that were in the other post:   LA/So Cal:  PG Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, Lonzo Ball  SG Demar Derozan, Jrue Holiday, Trevor Ariza, Norman Powell  SF Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Anderson  PF Taj Gibson, TJ Leaf, Kevon Looney, Chimezie Metu  C Kevin Love, Nikola Vucevic"
"Not really sure why you are comparing a defensive guard from the 90s to an offensive guard from the 60s, but no he is not straight up better than Oscar.  Oscar was the best offensive player ever until Magic/Bird.  He was the 60s version of combining prime Steph Curry with Prime Russell Westbrook.  By that I mean he basically led the league every year in APG, was top five in PPG, and led the league in efficiency.  This allowed his teams to basically be #1 if offensive efficiency every single year in the 60s despite having what was considered mediocre offensive support."
Man if Lebron refused to talk to the media after losses there would be hell raised. People on tv would literally be saying Michael Jordan would never. You know it's against the rules to ditch those post game presser right? Even a furious Russell Westbrook has to deal with them and then criticized for his responses post game.  Woj even wrote an article about Lebron's immaturity back then. You think he's gonna write one on Luka? Lebron critics already accuse Lebron of hogging all the credit and taking none of the blame.
I see people arguing Russ over Paul.    I feel like Chris Paul success on the Rockets 2 years ago where they were up 3-2 on the Warriors was better than anything Russell has ever done in his career and that includes his MVP season.    Honestly I know Westbrook was up 3-1 on the Warriors but that team was much worse than the team with Durant.   I don't buy the argument for Russ over CP3.    Much better shooter passer and bball iq.
"Kevin Johnson, John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Shannon Brown."
You think the Thunder which had a backcourt of Russell Westbrook and Andre Roberson was a great team?
this playoffs will prove whether Luka Doncic is the next LeBron or just another Russell Westbrook type guy.
Yes the Russell Westbrook who has been top 3 in assists like 3 years in a row
*Russell Westbrook nods*
"2nd best player on rockets is former mvp russell westbrook. 2nd best player with Luka is Kristaps prozingis, resident tree branch. That's why Luka is ahead."
Russell with Thunder and Steph with GSW remind me alot of Dirk with my Mavs. I know if Dirk had ever left we would've given him sooo much love every time he played against us. Westbrook will always be a OKC Thunder in my heart.
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Victor Oladipo, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony-- all before the franchise was even 10 years old."
Russell Westbrook is shit compared to KD. Y'all mad

Because one likes to make a comment on anything and everything and the other is Russell Westbrook
"It really is a shame Sam Presti will always be known for trading away Harden then subsequently losing Durant.  His track record aside from that is near perfect. He did almost everything perfectly for a small market team, and the amount of talent he's been able to find is incredible. It's just remarkable that he continually trades away late bloomers (James Harden, Victor Oladipo, Domas Sabonis, Eric Bledsoe... etc) (Here are his highlights).  2007:  * Drafted Kevin Durant (Best Player in the Draft) * Traded Ray Allen for #5 pick (Jeff Green), Wally Szerbiak, Delonte West, 2nd pick * Traded Rashard Lewis for Capspace and 2nd * Used Capspace to absorb Kurt Thomas' contract and 2 first round picks (Serge Ibaka and Quincy Pondexter)  2008:  * Drafted Russell Westbrook (Best Player in the Draft) * Drafted Serge Ibaka with the 24th pick (arguably top 5 player from the draft) * Traded a late first rounder for Thabo Sefolosha  2009:  * Drafted James Harden (Arguably the best player int he draft, Curry is the only real competition)  2010:  * Drafted Eric Bledsoe with the 18th pick, later traded for a future first  2011:  * Traded Bledsoe first round pick and others to Boston for Kendrick Perkins and Nate Robinson, maybe his worst non Harden decision). * Drafted Perry Jones III with the 28th pick  2012:  * Signed Derek Fisher * Traded Harden and Filler for Steven Adams, Mitch McGary, Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb  2013:  * Traded Kevin Martin for Cap Space * Drafted Steven Adams 12th (Top 5 player from the draft) * Signed Andre Roberson  2015:  * Traded Lance Thomas for Dion Waiters * Drafted Cameron Payne 14th overall * Traded Reggie Jackson, Kendrick Perkins and Tibor Pleiß for Enes Kanter and Kyle Singler  2016:  * Traded Serge Ibaka for Victor Oladipo, Domas Sabonis and Ersan Illyasova * Traded Illyasova for Jerami Grant  2017:  * Traded Anthony Morrow and Cameron Payne for Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott and 2nd round Pick * Traded Victor Oladipo and Domas Sabonis for Paul George * Traded Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and 2nd round pick for Carmelo Anthony  2018:  * Traded Carmelo and a protected first for Dennis Schröder  2019:  * Traded Paul George for Danillo Gallinari, SGA and a shit ton of picks * Traded Russell Westbrook for Chris Paul and 4 first rounders or pick swaps"
Because the Magic were a trash franchise as well. Oladipo turned into an all nba talent in one offseason. Sabonis was immediately putting up double doubles on the Pacers when he got traded. The pacers saw talent and knew how to develop them. The thunder just acquiesced to the “Russell Westbrook triple double farce”. Adams was getting so much crap last year about being overpaid and useless especially in the playoffs. And now everyone is giving him props.  What’s the difference? Russ isn’t there hindering their development by forcing the triple double crap.

"I think the idea is that it would have been easier to move Chris Paul's contract. If this doesn't work out with Russell Westbrook then Houston is really screwed, because it will be impossible to move Russ, especially since Houston gave up all their first-round picks to get him. If it doesn't work with Westbrook then Houston is stuck, and in that case I would not be surprised if eventually James Harden asks for a trade."
"**If you win 80% doing something I think you should do that something.**   There's an actual direct positive correlation to when Russ got a triple double for the Thunder they usually won the game.  There's no actual data on what your suggesting, it's clearly your opinion that Russ was ""hunting for an assist with the game on the line just to get a triple double"" that you are trying to state as fact.   Do you have any actual stats that back up your claim? Did he turn the ball over a lot and end up with 9 assists and the Thunder lost? Did you watch every second of Russell Westbrook basketball in OKC when he had 9 assists and was ""hunting"" them? Sure he did some stat hunting but I never felt like it hurt the team. He gave 100% effort every night to earn those stats and when he got his stats the Thunder won 80% of time.   This is what happens when you don't actually watch the games and form opinions on lazy narratives.   And why even word it that way ""worst superstar"" that's moronic, it's like saying LeBron sucks because he lost in the finals 5 times... Would it be better for Russ to be worse and just be a star like a Jimmy Butler level player? Would it be better for LeBron to lose in the ECF? Hell no."

Man I’m on a plane right now and I’m getting choked up lol. I was 16 years old when we drafted Russell Westbrook. I grew up with him.
"Should have been a video that starts off in plain darkness. Then a brick falls. Another. Soon it's a shower of bricks falling from the sky. The shot zooms out. They're all falling through a circular object. Is it a basketball hoop? No, it's a NBA championship ring. The bricks stop falling. The ring disintegrates into nothingness. The end. Russell Westbrook."
people are ignoring that westbrook has another year on his deal compared to paul. There was a world where you rode out pauls deal or even used a little assetes to dump it and then retooled around harden. Thats over now.. Houston has basically ended james hardens prime with russell westbrook. Harden likely demands a trade in a year or two if this experiment fails.
he did ask for a trade last year tho which is funny. reportedly might've even asked for a trade before paul george did.  https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/12/russell-westbrook-reportedly-wanted-a-trade-before-paul-george/
"Cant argue with numbers:   Russell Westbrook in Thunder History...  1st in point with 18,859  1st in Assists with 6,897  1st in rebounds with 5,760  1st in steals with 1,442  138 triple doubles in a Thunder uniform!!!   &amp;#x200B;  Dont like numbers KD? How about OKC fans vote on it and lets see how that works for you. Tosser Snek toolbag"
"Shit happens. Great teams lose to bad teams all the time. The 72 win Bulls lost to a franchise opening seasoning Raptors. Jordan didn't go sit at the edge of the bench. Worse yet, Westbrook was playing his old team, the Rockets have lost to bad teams before this season but Russell didn't react, and showing how emotional he is to silly narratives makes him look even more fragile."
"I mean, is Shaq a bitch for not reacting the same way or something? Shaq's message here, is that you're soft if you were truly offended by this shit. I mean, if you truly feel like the coach was being racist, then bring that shit up in the locker room like a man. Whether or not you agree with that sentiment, I'm sure that we can agree that if Shaq felt like the coach was being racist, he would have said something. Instead of reporting it to Twitter.   It's like the damn commentator for the Thunder who announced with energy night in and night out, who loved Russell Westbrook, and who made all of his dunks sound ferocious. One night, with enthuiasm and awe, said that Russell Westbrook is playing out of his cotton-pickin mind. He was fired. That's what Shaq is talking about."
I would love for Russ and harden to win a ring and then all come back for one last ride  Final game stats:  Russell Westbrook: 30/10/10 on 40%TS  James Harden: 45/5/5 on 30 FTs  Kevin Durant: 35/8/3 on 75%TS and 4 angry tweets
Russell Westbrook. Once he gets hot from three you're absolutely fucked.
Happy Russell Westbrook day!
"""James Harden gave Russell Westbrook depression."""
"OKC Fans last year: Westbrook is amazing. He's shooting isn't that bad. How can he be a ball hog, he's leading the league in assists? Durant bailed on us for no reason, he's the cupcake. Best rebounding guard of all time. More triple doubles than the Big O! You are all haters!  OKC Fans this year: Russell who?"
This has not been magically lost in the shuffle. Almost every analyst that I’ve seen make the argument that the trade was a mistake begins with the following premise: a fully fit Russell Westbrook is not good enough to be the second best player on a title team at this stage of his career and a fully fit CP3 is.   Flowing from that premise is that if your goal is to win a championship then your ONLY chance to do so is to keep CP3 and hope he’s healthy or trade him for a player who when fully fit is good enough to be the second best player on a championship team.
"Overrated: Robert Covington, Kyle Korver  Underrated: James Harden, Russell Westbrook"
Is Russell Westbrook
Exhibit B: Russell Westbrook
"&gt; In conclusion, I have never seen a GM talk more out of his ass than when Daryl Morey said he wasn't planning to trade Chris Paul last offseason.   Yeah, except that he said that before Russell Westbrook became available."
"""*It ain't my money.*"" - Russell Westbrook"
Fuck them kids.  - Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is a demigod
Halfway into the third quarter and Russell Westbrook is one of only two players (both teams) still scoreless!?
The dunk by Russell Westbrook! Now they're saying it's Chris Paul...
"""*I can shoot threes again without judgment...*"" - Russell Westbrook"
Just looking at the draft:  In 2008 the Timberwolves selected OJ Mayo the very next pick... Russell Westbrook  In 2009 they selected Jonny Flynn the very next pick... Steph Curry  In 2010 they selected Wesley Johnson the very next pick... Demarcus Cousins  In 2013 they selected Shabazz Muhamed the very next pick... Giannis  There will never in the history of the NBA draft have a team with worse selections than the Twolves did over that time period.
Ages when FA opens in 2022:  James Harden - 32  Kevin Durant - 33  Stephen Curry - 34  LeBron James - 37  Kawhi Leonard - 31  Paul George - 32  Kyrie Irving - 30  Chris Paul - 37  John Wall - 31  Russell Westbrook - 33  Bradley Beal - 29  Kemba Walker - 32  Jimmy Butler - 32
Ben Simmons   James Harden   Russell Westbrook  Pick one.
"The biggest difference I notice is that guys like Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook are in it, guys who were considered freshly minted elite players.   Obviously Curry and john Wall also got there, just not at the time."
Ah the good ol’ Russell Westbrook Insecurity Tour continues
"This kid is more Russell Westbrook than Russell Westbrook, and I know you know what I mean."
Clearly you've never watched Russell Westbrook.
Ha!  Tell that to Russell Westbrook.  wait...
Westbrook even got Jokic a [birthday present](https://www.google.com/amp/s/okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/06/18/russell-westbrook-nikola-jokic-reportedly-made-up-at-all-star-break/amp/).

[Lowe] Thank you for gathering here today. Russell Westbrook sucks unconditionally. And may God bless these United States. Amen. I will not be taking questions at this time. Seacrest out.
Russell Westbrook reigning player in the league.
We all like to think we do. Loyalty doesn’t always mean playing for the same team though. Only have to look as far as Russell Westbrook to see that

&gt; Who would’ve thought that Russell Westbrook was capable of such a dominant second prime  Every single one of his critics knew he was capable of this. It's why we've been so critical of him since 2012.
Russell Westbrook because he's an insane athlete
I’d like to see Utah run a 1-3-1 against Houston’s 5-out. That’d be interesting.  An entire series depending on Russell Westbrook vs Rudy Gobert at the rim.
james harden and russell westbrook are good at getting points
"Jimmy has never finished top 3 in MVP and DPOY voting, AD is better on both ends the only thing Jimmy has on him is ball handling and playmaking. PG has had better teams than AD has had, AD had never played with a Russell Westbrook caliber player that could help take pressure off him, best he has had is Jrue who is a fringe All Star and a couple of months of DeMarcus Cousins and that led to a first round sweep of the Blazers as the lower seed"
"Russell Westbrook made the playoffs a decades worth of years with two future MVPs, George, Ibaka, and at least solid role players every time and he's shot 40% or worse in like half of those trips. He isn't blameless"
PF maybe. We already have a perfectly good center and his name is russell westbrook
"It’s just so comical that it took coming to the most trigger happy team in history for Westbrook to become allergic to shooting threes. But what’s he’s doing is honestly just absurd. 33/8/8 on over 50% fg and 57% TS without relying on a 3pt shot is some pre-3 point line shit.   Who would’ve thought that Russell Westbrook was capable of such a dominant second prime. It’s like he became the player everyone wanted him to be overnight. Now people like Zach Lowe/Coach Nick are praising Russ, this is officially the day hell froze over."
"So Davis is a terrible player because he's only led his team to two total playoffs and missed them for the majority of his career, right? No, that's fucking stupid. It's not George's fault that his team's second best player during the end of his Indiana career was George Hill or Jeff Teague.   &gt; him and westbrook completely choked  Paul George during OKC's two playoff runs: 26.5 PPG, 56.3% TS  Russell Westbrook during OKC's two playoff runs: 26.4 PPG, 48.2% TS  Yeah bro, it's all Paul George's fault. Not the dude shooting below 40% from the field on 26 and 22 FGA over those two runs."

"alternatively your argument is ""nobody would ever consider trade for Russell Westbrook - Terry Rozier and Cody Zeller are just too valuable.""  6 months ago - ""hahahhaha Charlotte is so stupid for signing Terry Rozier to that contract. hahaha cody zeller isn't worth 15 million a year!""  so Charlotte couldn't possibly trade a hilariously negative value contract (per Reddit for the last 6 months) and cody zeller, who makes 15 million as a backup center, for a star who makes too much money and will age poorly.  To be clear - we're not talking about a championship team with a bright future right? we're talking about a middling team with a middling future and past.  again - why would they trade for a former MVP?   I dunno - the whole history of mediocre teams in the NBA?"
"&gt;HOU  &gt;Receives- Al Horford, Mike Scott, Zhaire Smith  &gt;Sends - Russell Westbrook  &gt;Houston gets a true center that can also shoot 3s.   &gt;PHI  &gt;SENDS - Al Horford, Mike Scott, Zhaire Smith  &gt;TBD  &gt;Sixers get players that fit better than Horford, ideally with a ball handler and expiring salary after 20-21  &gt;3rd Team  &gt;SENDS - TBD  &gt;RECEIVES - Russell Westbrook  &gt;3rd teams are all middling to OK that could possibly use an additional star.  &gt;Possible 3rd teams:  &gt;Suns - Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre, Frank Kaminsky  &gt;Hornets - Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Malik Monk  &gt;Magic - Evan Fournier (opts in), Terrence Ross, Al-Farouq Aminu  &gt;Bulls - Thad Young, Thomas Satoransky, Cristiano Felicio  &gt;Knicks - possibly trade Westbrook into cap space depending on what Sixers what, lots of players on team options/non-guarantees  &gt;Pistons - possibly trade Westbrook into cap space depending on what Sixers what, possibly Derrick Rose/Tony Snell  wtf is this bull shit"

I think we can all agree the 3 point contest spot should have gone to 2020 NBA All-Star Russell Westbrook.
"which despite being poor for a Russell Westbrook team, is still a winning percentage Devin Booker hasn't sniffed his entire career"
"How would he replace Russell, when Westbrook is averaging more points, rebounds, and assists...and that Westbrook is on a winning team"
Russell Westbrook.

"I think it's because the punishment is more severe. Ever since the malice at the palace, the NBA has been very concerned about the image of its players. If you take a swing at another player, you are getting suspended. Not a big deal if it's markief Morris, but if it's Russell Westbrook you giannis, you might have a problem"
I hope the NBA picks Russell Westbrook just to be petty

1. Daddying Russell Westbrook
"&gt; Defensively, Westbrook is nothing short of outstanding, as evidenced by the phenomenal work he did locking down the three top scoring guards in the Pac-10 this season, O.J. Mayo, Jerryd Bayless, and James Harden. He is long, strong and very fundamentally sound, getting into a terrific defensive stance on every possession, moving his feet incredibly well, and being absolutely tenacious getting after his matchup. His wingspan, combined with his huge hands and outstanding anticipation skills make him a terror in the passing lanes, and this is a big factor why he spends so much time in transition offensively. -   Source: http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/russell-westbrook-5062/ ©DraftExpress"

Russell “Dede” Westbrook
Russell Westbrook: your point?
"We actually also have legendary 6'3 7-footer russell westbrook at center, thank you very much"
"And Westbrook averaged 30 ppg for the last 3 years in the playoffs, but never got out of the first round, because sometimes stats can be empty. There is a reason why Wilt lost almost every time to Russell even when Wilt had the better team. No one ever makes the argument that Russell would be a 5x mvp in today's game though do they, and he was a better player than Wilt.  Don't reply, because I don't care."
"Bill Russell dominated Chamberlain on defense. Picture a guy like Hakeen on him, he would not be able to get shit done.   Difference is Lebron has been the best player on a finals winning team 3x times. Chamberlain had 1 year were he won and was the best player on his team. Chamberlain is the westbrook of old school nba, he has a lot of athletic talent and can put up great stats, but you watch him play and understand why he can't really be the #1 option on a playoff team for that long."
IIRC last season Paul George's TS% dropped whenever he didn't share the floor with Russell Westbrook.

"It's kind of pointless to double Russ.   He's not a threat from the perimeter, so the answer to him has always been sag off and put as many bodies as possible on him as soon as he starts going downhill.   If they double Russ to take him out of the play, then they've just given 4 shooters, including one James Harden, a 4 on 3 situation. Plus, good luck trapping Russell Fucking Westbrook and not just leaving the paint wide open for him to feast."
"what elite talent does russell westbrook have? seriously? rebounding for a guard? fantastic! i agree. he's a great rebounder  is he an elite passer? eh.. debateable. he gets a lot of assists, and he's a pretty good playmaker in general. but we also know he makes tons of terrible decisions and has a pretty poor assist to turnover ratio compared to some of the better all time passers in the league (cp3, nash, magic)  is he a good scorer? he gets shots up, but he's a relatively poor finisher, and downright terrible shooter. he's a volume guy. he gets a lot of opportunities and he converts them at a sub optimal rate. he's a decent/below average scorer when figuring in efficiency.  saying that someone who is a second option by default is the worse player  is just an awful way to think about this. there's immense value in knowing your role, playing within yourself and propping up better players than you  would you rather have five demar derozan level first option players, or a team like the warriors, who have a defined first, second, third, fourth option? the warriors right? because if you have demar, you're missing out on a ton of the little things that make a team go.  i'm not gonna keep doing this cause its getting late now. but if you say i have no understanding of the game, you're lying to yourself. you just don't think about the game the same way i do. that's okay."
"I’m sorry but if you think Klay Thompson is a better player than Russell Westbrook you’re either a delusional fan of Klay or a massive hater of Westbrook.   At his peak Russ was a top 5 player on the planet and an MVP that dragged a bad team to the playoffs essentially by himself. Klay at his peak was top 15 at best and was surrounded by the most stacked team in NBA history, which allowed him to get easier shots than Russ has ever been able to get because teams had to deal with KD AND Steph."
"and russell westbrook can't shoot 45% from 3 on insane volume. matter fact, he actually can't even shoot over 35% apparently  why are the 10/10 so amazing??? russ has the ball in his hands all the time. he's a good passer. he's gonna get assists. but he also turned the ball over at an extremely high rate that season too.  you just value the basic casual ass stats like ppg/rpg/apg so you think russ is better lol"
"klay is absoluetly 100% a better player than russell westbrook  probably the best 3/D guy ever, one of the greatest shooters ever who can scale on any great team, doesn't need the ball to be successful.  russ is wildly inefficient, makes awful decisions, and has a better standing with NBA fans because he's a good rebounder for his position and plays hard every night"
"“The Rockets' James Harden and Russell Westbrook have each scored at least 30 points in the same game five times this season:  1️⃣ Dec. 21, 2019 2️⃣ Jan. 11, 2020 3️⃣ Jan. 18, 2020 4️⃣ Jan. 31, 2020 5️⃣ Feb. 11, 2020  No other duo in team history has more such games in a single season.”"
So how about that Russell Westbrook?
"Russell"" DeAndre Hopkins"" Westbrook"

RUSSELL WESTBROOK SPINNIN AND DISHIN
OMFG RUSSELL FUCKING WESTBROOK
"""*I'm coming, you better be ready...*"" - Russell Westbrook"
"Hi, my name is Russell Westbrook, and I don’t give a fuck."
"We're the Rockets in a game where everyone is heat checking, is tried and James Harden and Russell Westbrook are here: thus iff Smart doesn't close out this game I'll be mad."
Imagine saying Giannis is taking more threes than Russell Westbrook.  This season had been a spectacle.
"Russell ""small like curry shoot like Shaq"" Westbrook"
&gt; Top 5 least valuable player in the league according to PIPM  You should never rely on a singular stat to capture a player's entire value.   PIPM also says:   - Javale McGee &gt; Nikola Vucevic  - John Henson &gt; Domas Sabonis  - Eric Bledsoe &gt; Dame Lilliard  - Hassan Whiteside &gt; Joel Embiid or Bam Adebayo  - George Hill &gt; Fred VanVleet  - Patty Mills &gt; Trae Young  - Kris Dunn &gt; Russell Westbrook  - Mikal Bridges &gt; Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  - Josh Hart &gt; Jrue Holiday  - Meyers Leonard &gt; John Collins  - Reggie Jackson &gt; Donavan Mitchell  - Tomas Satoransky &gt; Brandon Ingram  - Jordan Clarkson &gt; Bradley Beal  - Jeff Teague &gt; Lou Williams  - Frank Ntilikina &gt; D'Angelo Russell  - Svi Mykhailiuk &gt; Demar DeRozan  - Ben McLemore &gt; Ja Morant  - Derrick White &gt; Malcolm Brogdon  - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist &gt; Steph Curry
"Giannis is tied for 4th in NBA endorsement dollars at $20 mil for 2019-2020 (active players), he’s gonna do fine with endorsements regardless of which team he is on.  I combined the data from two recent Forbes articles about [top 10 highest paid players for 2019-2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/10/23/the-nbas-highest-paid-players-2019-20-lebron-james-scores-record-92-million/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=2763997863&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrSportsMoneyTwitter#223fcf8bdae6)  (salary+endorsements), and another on [top shoe contracts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/08/28/the-nbas-richest-shoe-deals-lebron-kobe-and-durant-are-still-no-match-for-michael-jordan/#76ff41b03d02), stripped out salary and reordered to get an approximation of how Giannis ranks. (This list doesn't not completely represent endorsement dollars, as the first article combines salary, so some older players who's salary has dipped and still have big endorsements might technically make the list, such as Derrick Rose who makes $11m from shoes).  &amp;#x200B;  1. LeBron James, $55 million ($32m shoes) 2. Stephen Curry, $45 million ($20m shoes) 3. Kevin Durant, $35 million ($26m shoes) 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo, $20 million ($10m shoes) 5. Kyrie Irving, $20 million ($11m shoes) 6. Russell Westbrook, $18 million ($12m shoes) 7. James Harden, $17 million ($14m shoes) 8. Klay Thompson, $15 million ($9m shoes) 9. Damian Lillard, $14 million ($10m shoes) 10. Zion Williamson, $13 million (full amount unknown, only shoes)"
https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/12/russell-westbrook-reportedly-wanted-a-trade-before-paul-george/  All reports out there say Westbrook is the one who asked OKC for a trade and OKC agreed to it. That's why he was allowed to pick his destination
"Trae and Steph are not as similar as people say. Besides, 'generational' !=  'unique style of play' anyway. Nobody plays quite like, say, Nikola Jokic or Ben Simmons or Russell Westbrook either."
"“Before you say, 'Shaq can't play in this era today,' I'm already playing. My name is Russell Westbrook."""
Any advanced stat is going to fail at evaluating small samples. You can't criticize a stat for it's inability to properly evaluate small samples.  But DBPM literally thinks Russell Westbrook is an amazing defender. That's inexcusable.
Giannis  Lebron  Kawhi  James Harden  AD  Dame Lillard  Luka Doncic  Nikola Jokic  Paul George  Joel Embiid  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler  Kyrie Irving  Rudy Gobert  Karl Anthony Towns  Pascal Siakam  Ben Simmons  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum
"It’s disingenuous to be upset at the players who don’t play this position who are finalists, so let’s compare him to the point guards selected over him. Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Malcolm Brogdon, Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker and Marcus Smart. It looks like they’re leaning towards veterans who have experience playing with team USA already. Those guys have pedigrees more prestigious than Trae or with the case of Brogdon and Smart are absolute killers on defense."
"To be clear I’m saying he’d either rank somewhere between 20-30 to 15-20.  I don’t think he’d be top 30 right now though(especially when you factor in injured players)  In no order  Giannis, Lebron, Kawhi, luka, Anthony Davis, jimmy butler, jokic, dame, Rudy Gobert, Chris Paul, Kemba, Tatum, Trae, Paul George, Ben Simmons, Joel embiid, KAT, kyrie, KD, donavan Mitchell, James harden, Russell Westbrook, pascal siakam, sabonis, oladipo, brogdan. Bam, Ingram, SGA. Middleton, Devin Booker, d’lo(maybe?) Lowry.   I’m not acting like that’s consensus, but I think most of those players would be up there."
Could you do this for Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook wish he was shooting 3's as well as Giannis lol...
"This is the shitiest take I've read so far, so I had to comment. Beal wanted to stay in Washington, he chose to sign there, there was no trade happening. Google his opinion. The Russell rumors were at the same time as butler and we ended up with Butler. At that point Tyler and Nunn had not played a minute and were not being used as leverage to get Westbrook.  Your take sucks ass it's in lala land."
Unfortunately we can't plug Russell Westbrook in at center so I don't think it'll be very successful
As a kid I was always more of a players fan than a team fan(aside from me rooting for the Raptors) . The Thunder   was the first team that I gravitated towards.  They were young and exciting plus Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant we're my favorite players(Russ still is). Even tho Russ got traded I still rock with the Thunder.
"My choices for a 12man Roster: Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, Khris Middleston, Bam Adebayo, Dwight Howard, Montrezl Harrell, Jaylen Brown, Klay Thompson, Javale McGee.  I would love to see LeBron/Cp3/Durant/PG13/Kawhi but injury/age and the fact that some of them have already won 2 golds they may give others the opportunity.  I would probably bet everything I have that Kawhi wont be on the team."
"Russell Westbrook was a low IQ, inefficient ball hog for most of his time in OKC. Very talented, but the dude made some of the most brain dead plays I ever seen time and time again in the playoffs. I remember that series against San Antonio in 2012 WCFs, Westbrook was the definition of unclutch. Harden and Durant did some heavy lifting in big spots."
Saying I will never understand why Russell Westbrook gets the amount of hate he does isn’t  saying that saying dame &gt; Russ is hate
I will never understand why Russell Westbrook gets the amount of hate he does
Russell “Kevin Gates” Westbrook
"He’s a plus defender, an incredible rebounder and sees the floor very well. Russell Westbrook with 4 others around who can shoot makes it so much easier for him to excel with his tool set. I personally believe he can be a number 1 guy, and I believe him and harden compliment each other well"
Russell Westbrook has been excellent lately.  What bothers me however is that at the moment Harden and Westbrook can't seem to be hot at the same time.  This will be necessary in the playoffs if the Rockets want to go far.
"I am become Russell Westbrook, the layer of 3 point bricks"
"Na he just needs to do Russell westbrook shit. Always drive at the rim, dont be scared of getting fouled, and make ur free throws.  If he does that, and plays elite defence then he is a top 10 player."
"Also I love that he cherry picked the Russell Westbrook games as an example for his defensive “issues”. Especially given the fact that Westbrook at his prime physically, was one of the most explosive guards ever. Not even the greatest defenders ever could always contain a player like Westbrook all game for an entire series. But yeah let’s keep listening to these no bodies over people who cover the games with context and people who played the game at a high level."
"The first NBA MVP was awarded when my dad was 6 and my mom was 5. My dad turns 70 on Thursday.   Every MVP was still alive when I was born. That was over 40 years ago. That Kobe is only the 3rd to go is sort of batshit insane, especially considering very tall people often have short lives.    We still have, somehow, Pettit, Cousy, Russell, Robertson, Unseld, Reed, Kareem, Cowens, McAdoo, Walton, Dr. J, Bird, Magic, MJ, Barkley, Hakeem, Robinson, Karl Malone, Shaq, AI, Timmy, KG, Nash, Dirk, LeBron, Rose, KD, Steph, Westbrook, Harden and Giannis."
"Bill Russell, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Rick Barry, Michael Jordan, Isiah Thomas, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Reggie Miller, Allen Iverson, Manu Ginobili, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook.."
"Yeah, he said he Russ reminded him of a younger version of himself. It was apparently in a promo video for Jordan shoes, but still. MJ doesn’t say things like that often.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-jordan-says-russell-westbrook-reminds-him-of-his-younger-self/"
"There's only a few nba athletes I'd be confident enough to bet on it. In no particular order: Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Giannis, LeBron, and (yes) Draymond Green.   In the scope of active athletes in general: Messi, Tiger, Mayweather Jr, Serena Williams. I'm sure I'm missing more."
It’s like you built a really sweet bird house in shop class and then you get locked in the teachers office and can only watch as it gets slammed on the floor over and over and you can’t do anything about it  And then Russell Westbrook shows up wearing some weird sweater he took from his grandmas closet and teabags you.
Eric “Russell “James Harden” Westbrook” Gordon
"It’s not just that they are Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul, I’m pretty sure (due to a confluence of age, ability and a host of other things) were actually close. I’m not minimizing the relationships that Kobe forged with other players (Giannis and Luka come to mind), but Westbrook, lebron, Paul all played on *multiple* all-star teams and Olympic teams together. Their primes meaningfully overlapped with Kobe’s second prime and as a result have battle stories and time spent together on long international trips.  My guess is they were all close in a “let’s grab dinner with the families next time I’m in town” kind of way that most players aren’t."
28 points on 28 shots. The russell westbrook
1) Be Russell Westbrook
"well if they were nobodies then they likely wouldn’t have gotten drafted or even scouted. there are players who were nobodies/subpar in high school but then got noticed in college though, if that’s what you’re looking for (some examples of this would be dennis rodman, russell westbrook, ja morant)"
"Again, I don't doubt there is only one kobe. Kobe is Kobe and in terms of basketball will always and should always be around. But if the criteria is just ""spreading basketball,"" Yao, Manu, Drazen, etc. should as well. The world will always remember Kobe because Kobe was stupidly bullheaded competitive in the best and worst of ways. He was a pleasure to watch and an inspiration to everyone except the opposing team.   Honestly, if I were in the league office, I honestly think the best way to handle it is to create a ""Mamba mentality"" award given to the most Kobe esque of players (Russell Westbrook wins the Mamba mentality award for shooting the most shots despite missing the previous 20... for the 5th year in  a row[I jest but not too much]). All I'm saying is that if Kobe is the standard for leaguewide retirement of a number, 10 other numbers would have to be retired as well."
"Of course. But you can shore up those weaknesses so they are less exploitable. For you to deny that being possible is to not acknowledge reality.   Russell Westbrook has been a solid open three point shooter in his career, already. I have no clue why you continue to pretend as if that is something out of the realm of possibility for Westbrook to rediscover once again.   You are a Warriors fan.  Stephen Curry is still a limited defender.  But he has worked to become far less of a liability than earlier in his career. It's still a weakness relative to peers, but he's no longer inept in that skill.  Would you rather Stephen Curry never work on his defense and continue to be a massive liability who cannot stop a nosebleed or was it important for him to dedicate an offseason with the training staff in improving his weakest area.   Ben Simmons is 23 years old. I have no idea why you're eulogizing his potential as a shooter at 23 years old. He spent much of the offseason trying to work on shooting threes. His head coach is pressuring him to shoot threes. His own fanbase is pressuring him to shoot threes. Are you going to call his trainer and organization wrong for pushing him in that direction? Are you calling them stupid for pushing them in that direction from your armchair? Or are they doing so because they understand the importance of improving in the three and understand that he CAN make strides in that shot without enough work.  &gt;You're still acting as though you can force it to happen.  Nobody said that at all. You aren't reading my posts and you aren't arguing in good faith either."
"&gt; Yeah the rockets would want Simmons someone who won't attempt perimeter shots, alongside Russell Westbrook who shoots 23% from three.  If they trade Harden, they are blowing the team up (like OKC), so they would probably trade WB if they could as well."
"Yeah the rockets would want Simmons someone who won't attempt perimeter shots, alongside Russell Westbrook who shoots 23% from three. Great idea that would definitely happen if harden went up for trade"

Russell Westbrook
"For sure. Russell Westbrook might be a little crazy, but I never have any doubt that man gives every ounce of drive in every game. He wants to win and will do whatever he sees as necessary."
Seen on twitter before this game- stats from a 10 game Russell Westbrook stretch from a rockets fan with the ending line of “Don’t EVER tell me Dame Lillard is better than this man (Westbrook).”
"I have no idea what you're on about.  LeBron substantially improving as a jumpshooter is arguably the defining development of his prime. He didn't just stagnate, he absolutely worked on becoming good in an area that he was weak in until defenses could no longer just ignore him until entering the paint.   &gt;Trying to shove every player at a position into the same archtype is a good way to end up with a pretty boring league because nobody gets to play against type.  Nooooooooo idea who you're talking to lmao. Like I'm not even saying this at all.  &gt;Curry and Magic Johnson and John Stockton are three very different kinds of PGs - but they're all considered all-time greats because they were still highly successful playing to their strengths.  What does this have to do with Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook? You know that Magic became a substantially better shooter as his prime developed and it made him better as a player? That Curry became a substantially better defender, finisher, off ball player as his prime developed and it made him better as a player? You know he's been working on getting to the free throw line more often so that he has another source of offense when the jumpers don't fall, and it makes him a better player? They didn't just stick to their strengths. They worked on their weaknesses and made them strengths too. Superstars tend to do shit like that.  Nobody is saying that these players need to specialize in the same shit. It's about rounding out your weaknesses to make it more challenging for defenses to account for you. You can still have strengths that define you as  a player. Just that your weaknesses are less glaring and harder to exploit."
1. Kawhi Leonard 2. Steph Curry 3. James Harden 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. LeBron James 6. Anthony Davis 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Joel Embiid 9. Luka Doncic 10. Paul George 11. Damian Lillard  12.

I dunno how the fuck Westbrook played in this. He and Harden idolized Kobe. Harden and DeRozan both couldn't make it. Russell must have felt out of body.
"First of all, I'm not from Boston so I couldn't give a fuck what a random person on reddit says, let a lone get defensive about it.  Secondly, all what you said could be aplied to any city in America since it's all anecdotal.  Third, if Russell(Westbrook?) doesn't like the city, well that seals it then, right?   Get a grip."
"While it is not always deserved, players will always get criticized for this until they make the playoffs. KAT is an extremely good player but he only made the playoffs once when Butler was there.   It takes an all time great player to take subpar players to the playoffs like a Tim Duncan, Larry Bird, Russell Westbrook, and etc. Hell Westbrook’s carry job was so impressive combined with his triple double that he got MVP without a top seed."
"I think what you meant was, Utah is the place where one fan insulted Russell Westbrook, and was banned for life for being a huge cocksucker.   I don't understand why you're using ""same people"" as if these people are at all similar to the aforementioned ""one fan"", or why you're using the word ""where"" as if all other people are a location or group that fosters bad behavior. In fact, I sense some salt on your end, sir."
"Only 3-4 slots.  [Lillard is well ahead of Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, and Paul by most measures.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Damian+Lillard&amp;player_id1_select=Damian+Lillard&amp;player_id1=lillada01&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id3_hint=Devin+Booker&amp;player_id3_select=Devin+Booker&amp;player_id3=bookede01&amp;y3=2020&amp;player_id4_hint=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id4_select=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id4=paulch01&amp;y4=2020&amp;player_id5_hint=Donovan+Mitchell&amp;player_id5_select=Donovan+Mitchell&amp;y5=2020&amp;player_id5=mitchdo01&amp;idx=players)  Behind Lillard, I think Paul is likely in, then Booker is in a scrum with Westbook and Mitchell.  Those three are really close.  Booker is having a better shooting year than those two but is worse on defense than they are.  I think he gets snubbed."
-Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook and James Harden both being at their best is not a thing that can happen. They are a 1st round exit imo and a safe one at that.
Russell Westbrook is an okay scorer if you think about it
Try Russell Westbrook driving ***19.6*** times a game and averaging 6.6 FTA for the season.

"Looks at post history, “Is Russell Westbrook a starting caliber PG?”  Lmao"
"&gt; ""And let's not mince words. This playoff run, it's not a run, this playoff fall is a disaster for Russell Westbrook. A disaster.  &gt; ""He shot, I think 36 percent from the field, much worse than that from three-point range. He was the worst pull-up jump shooter in the entire NBA this year. The worst statistically. 104 guys took at least three pull-ups per game. He was No. 104. &gt;  &gt; ""Interestingly, he shot 65 percent at the rim, which is his best figure ever. But then you have these games where he's just throwing (expletive) up at the backboard."" &gt;  &gt; Lowe went on to further analyze Westbrook's game, particularly his lack of effort on defense and his inefficient shooting. &gt;  &gt; ""This is a disastrous playoff run for him,"" said Lowe. ""I don't know what you do because you're looking at the contract. To answer your question, I think only John Wall's is worse."
I love Russell Westbrook
"Didn't the Rockets have to add assets to Chris Paul to get Russell Westbrook back? So wouldn't it be more accurate to say ""then he used (x assets) to convince OKC to exchange Russell Westbrook for him""?"
Russell Westbrook.
"I don't know if people have ever heard of him but this guy named Russell Westbrook plays pretty good when James Harden isn't on the court. Also, Anthony Davis is a pretty good player of basketball behind LeBron James.   More of what you are looking for: Kristaps is out of the limelight because of the Doncic and Carlise show but he still has a game that could be built around as the 1st option. Still haven't seen a clear vision of a team built around him but he still deserves one."
Russell Westbrook put up a season high in points last game and the most points he’s put up this past month

"Iverson was never asked to distribute to the extent that Westbrook has had to shoulder. That doesn't inherently make Russell a better passer. Magic is a better passer than Stockton despite John having more APG per 100.  As I said, AI was more creative, talented, and had superior vision. Prime AI was primarily a shooting guard, not a PG like Westbrook has been.  And per 100 is a terrible way to compare. As I said it has nothing to do with numbers (even if AI would have matched Westbrook's APG numbers had he been asked to distribute to the same degree, with the same pace, the same free-flowing pace and space era instead of iso hero ball, comparable teammates, and usage rate)"
Stats stats stats. Stats are all that matters huh? Context doesnt matter. The era that Allen Iverson played doesn't matter huh?  Allen Iverson owns Russell Westbrook. Put Westbrook on that 01' 76ers team and see if they make it to the finals still and get a win off of arguably the greatest team of all time the 01' Lakers
"Harden looks up from the bench as the team takes a timeout. Russ has been carrying the team the whole night but Harden somehow looks more gassed. Russell comes over to James and looks at him in the eye, ""i gotchu fam tonight"" he said, a drip of Westbrook's sweat fell onto harden's shorts, right into his lap, then rolled and disappeared around the crotch area. A couple more drips fell onto Harden's jersey. Westbrook leaned in closer as if he's doing it on purpose. Harden stares deeply into Westbrook's eyes, noticing that Russell's iris is of a lighter shade, the last time he looked at those pretty eyes like this was from all those years ago in OKC, where he shared a sweat-drenched and passionate night with Russell while a guy named Kevin watched on the side."
"Well, I understand that, but you also understand who should have the onus of proof, right?    It doesn't really matter anyway: Even *if* he said it, this would make him wrong on a numerical level, but not necessarily wrong on what factual relation he was trying to convey: That the rebounding numbers of Steven Adams are significantly deflated by playing with Russell Westbrook. The gargantuan jump in DRB% and therefore TRB% and REB/36 show that there is clearly a correlation (causation can always be argued, of course). As already discussed, his stagnant RPG is related to a big drop in MPG which could be tied to dozens of factors unrelated to rebounding."
I’m just passing through here to remind y’all that you guys are buggin the hell out! comparing Kyrie Irving to Russell Westbrook.
The death if Russell Westbrook has been greatly exaggerated
well chris paul in the last 10 games:  19.7 Pts 5.8 Ast 5.2 Reb on 51.1 / 38.6 / 87.5 shooting splits with 2.2 TO (**okc on 7-3 winning record**)  Russell westbrook last 10 games:  29.8 Pts 8.1 Ast 8.1 Reb on 51.9 / 23.8 / 69.6 shooting splits with 4 TO (**rockets with 6-4 wining record**)  Both are playing well but you gotta remember westbrook is taking nearly 22 fga per game while cp3 takes 12 fga.
Russell Westbrook has been objectively better than James Harden for the past month.
Best Russell Westbrook since Russell Westbrook
And they said Russell Westbrook is not an all star. Smh
"Russell ""AND ONEE"" Westbrook"
"Russell Westbrook has finally figured out he shouldn't shoot 3s and it is both amazing to watch and scary for the rest of the league  Also, BeastBrook has easily been the best Rockets for about a month now and is carrying Harden super slump. I'm not a Russ fan by any means but he's so fucking impressive and you have to respect him always going 150% no matter what, he should be an all-star, just hope it doesn't bump Rudy out (if he's one of the two ""wild card"" not talking forward/guards)"
Russell Westbrook is a Houston Rocket and I love it

Russell Westbrook is #1 on my Myspace friends right now
Maybe Russell Westbrook is no longer coachable.
yes thank you u/TheAmbitious1 for those wonderful proverbs and an analysis on the psyche of NBA star Russell Westbrook
Russell westbrook has a relationship with courtside hecklers the same way Robin lopez hates mascots.
New challenge for David DeLooper...  Get Russell Westbrook to try to eject you from each stadium.
"Russell ""The Bouncer"" Westbrook"
“Russell Westbrook appears to be a little bitch.”
Russell 'Boo Hoo Waah Waah' Westbrook
Yes 1 time all star Russell Westbrook just like khris middleton and Harden was their only good bench player unlike the whole bucks team who has the best supporting cast in the whole league.
I love the sudden narrative change with russell westbrook.
"There are people in this world out there, right now, this very second, who will tell you Russell Westbrook isn't an all-star. Think about that for a minute."
"Thought he wasn’t gonna make with how he started the season, but he turned it around the last month. He’ll get in, probably take what would’ve been Ingram’s reserve spot. He’s russell westbrook lol"
"Russell ""Stalin"" Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook
The next best would be Paul George or Russell Westbrook and neither of their games were must watch on OKC or Indiana
"Russell Westbrook is the exact kind of ""star"" I can't stand. So much talent but won't focus his work ethic on improving an obvious fatal flaw in his game (outside shooting). Westbrook has great court vision, basketball IQ, and a killer instinct. If he would learn to shoot, he would relevant for years to come. As it is, he will go the way of Iverson and Carmelo."
Russell Westbrook should be one of the best. I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone say anything bad about him as a teammate.
*checks title of thread*  Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook brings teams to the playoffs in the western conference. Russell Westbrook is an mvp. Russell Westbrook is consistently mentioned by former teammates as one of the best leaders they’ve had. And that’s the man they want to mention with Kyrie lmao.
Man stop lyin... when has Russell Westbrook ever had a losing streak and throw his team under the bus?
"Russell Westbrook: played for OKC for like a decade  Elston Turner: player that does not exist  This is just one example, the numerous instances of “now they’re saying his foot was on the line” are themselves bad enough. I really can’t spell it out any clearer why people treat them differently, but if you truly think Harlan is just as bad as Marv in terms of errors then we should just end the conversation here because we’re clearly not watching the same people."
See that’s a valid reason - Annoying and obnoxious fans. But don’t act like it was because Alex Caruso got more votes than Russell Westbrook in a popularity contest that doesn’t even affect the all-star roster.
The 6 seed right now has James harden and Russell Westbrook harden is better than any of them (kills me to say that I really don’t like to watch James harden) and Russell Westbrook has had a better single season than any one of them also.
This the man yall tryin to compare to Russell Westbrook? “What?! Yall trippin trippin
"Someone check me on this bc I might be wrong  Can we compare each players 1st, 2nd, 3rd games to one another so on  And see if Caruso ever once outscored outrebounded or out assisted russell Westbrook?"
"Demar and Russell Westbrook. Both are only notable on offense, one is a chucker and neither can defend better than Pascal. Westbrook is a much better passer though, I'll give him that."
"I think for a lot of people close to the game like players, ex players, coaches it's very difficult to knock out an incumbent all star. For whatever reason there is a serious inertia and for someone like Westbrook in their minds its like ""of course he's an all star, it's Russell Westbrook""  Which I totally get and understand that Westbrook is still a bigger draw than someone like Rudy gobert, and for an exhibition it makes sense  But the place where it falls down is that no one really cares or watches the actual game, and the recognition is far and away the most important factor. Be it for salary incentives or just personal pride being named to the game is far more meaningful than what actually happens in the game  This means that players that deserve it just routinely get snubbed. This year someone like Booker mitchell Ingram all probably deserve it but 2 of those guys probably will not make it because we will see an old head or two. I personally think gobert and Mitchell from my team are surely all stars, but I thought gobert was an ez all star in the past and well, he wasnt"
"Steph Curry a worse shooter than Russell Westbrook? Ah, very interesting!"

**NEVER FORGET**  LeBron ended up trading Russell Westbrook for Ben Simmons. Westbrook shot 8/20 (1/8 from 3) in 19 minutes. Westbrook and Steph (who shot 6/23) cost Team Giannis the game.
"My point was to show the irrational hate people have towards russell Westbrook, where he can put up spectacular numbers and no ones bats and eye, but when a popular player does the same thing it’s celebrated like a championship   You got defensive about that for some odd reason, probably because you’re a Mavericks fan"
"He literally listed Westbrook as one of his potential all stars this year, he hated the CONTRACT, which most everyone in the league does  Even if you think that’s a terrible take, one bad take does not equal “blatantly biased”, he’s not on some warpath against Russell Westbrook, he barely mentions him"
Not including Russell Westbrook is really a disgrace.
"Nah, he only got five.

"I am stunned that his 20/20/20 is NOT on this list. Maybe he only got five, but I watched that game and he was everywhere! Not to mention, somebody walks away with 20 REB, you're gonna think it was a high number on the offensive side, too.  But, this is Russell Westbrook that we are discussing, so ..."
You can be a great defender while not getting those stats and can be a bad defender while getting a shit ton of them (Klay Thompson and Russell Westbrook are examples). Steph Curry led the league in steals a few years ago. They're not good indicators of defense.
I want someone to ask Russell Westbrook this question. He wouldn't be as polite as Lebron was here
"Westbrook right now is not a top 20 player. He's not better than Lebron, Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Harden, AD, Towns, Booker, Simmons, Trae, Mitchell, Gobert, Embiid, Lowry, Lillard, Jokic, Ingram, Walker, Siakam, Kyrie, and a few others you can make an argument for over Russell.  And there'd be even more ahead of him there weren't so many injured stars like Steph, KD, Klay, and Oladipo"
"Or because there’s an irrational hate for Russell Westbrook, and there’s an abundance of Europeans on Reddit"
Stay be one of the almost lifers. (Almost lifer is like Russell Westbrook)
"he’s making too much money regardless of if he’s a 1, 2 or 3. 40 players this season take &gt;15 shots/gm. KP ranks 40th in TS among those players.   Below guys like Collin Sexton, Terry Rozier and Russell Westbrook."

"I mean if Russ keeps this up, I think they are built better than the teams with CP3. The court is space perfect for him to do what he does best, which is get downhill and attack the paint.

For Harden I think Dantoni realized the ball screens with Capela brought traps to James and to open the floor with shooters. It's making it harder to trap and its making teams pay for trapping. They spray a three or it lets Russ go one on one and attack the rim! He's like their Center on offense with shooters spaced around him.

"The thing about Luka is that he hasn't had a 'big' performance in a while. Most of his MVP hype and 'Luka is a top 5 player in the league' noise comes from back in mid-December before his first injury. Since then, he hasn't really had a statement game against a top winning team while Russ has shown up against nearly every good team that he's faced.   Dallas' remaining schedule is tougher than Houston's according to Tankathon so Luka will have a bunch more opportunities to gathermomentum himself (with some of those opportunities coming against Houston themselves) but I'd say 1st team is now Russ' to lose.

yeah that sure happened after they made the transition to the pocket rockets oh wait their first game was on the road and Russell fucking Westbrook was the best player in the game and they won. To say they will get slapped for sure is a brain damage tier statement
thought this was a D'lo post at first lol. kinda weird to see people call him Russell and not Russ or Westbrook
"Russell westbrook the type of dude to fuck your girl but ask permission first, and youre totally okay with it"
"For me 2017 was an outlier as Russell Westbrook is objectively a bad 3 point shooter and in that one year he shot significantly better than average and that alone was enough to make him an MVP level player.  Meanwhile, every single thing that 2020 Russell Westbrook is doing is sustainable."

RUSSELL WESTBROOK
"My lifetime is going to consist of guys from the 2000's onwards. Most of them will be dunk contest participants.  1. Jason Richardson. Won back-to-back dunk contests and probably had several top 20 dunks in NBA dunk contest history and yet is never mentioned at all. Hell he was an electrifying in-game dunker too, swooping for 360's, posters, windmills, and his alley-oops with Baron Davis were legendary back in the day in the Bay Area.  2. Desmond Mason. Like J-Rich he had some electrifying dunks both in-game and in the dunk contest. He was a pure-bred high-flyer.  3. Baron Davis. Athletically he was Russell Westbrook before Russell Westbrook. Especially before he tore his ACL in college. A point guard who would out jump almost everyone on the court, B-Diddy was a highlight machine in his prime. Dunked on KG and most famously on AK-47, once Davis got a head of steam to the basket, he would not be denied.  4. JR Smith. Yeah he got meme'd out of the league but in his prime, the JR had really flashy dunks, including a 360 alley-oop, windmills in traffic, and a poster on Gary Neal.  5. Shannon Brown.  6. Gerald Wallace.   7. Smush Parker. Yeah he wasn't a great NBA player but the man could fly, I'll give him that.   8. Jamario Moon.   9. Rudy Gay.  10. Richard Jefferson."
Russell Westbrook is so good
"I'm kinda surprised myself. But I think that the ""sophomore year"" part can actually be a detriment for that. In a way, surely young players are exciting because they're new and they have the most potential to improve but it's an unknown, yeah? In theory, that could be said, but I see that many players who are not ""hyped"" when already going into the league take a long time to be noticed. Like, being 11th pick... Coming in the league the same time as Doncić and Trae Young... I think people care much more about players that they already expect to be stars. Even if they are bad, they are talked about. Like Andrew Wiggins is always a topic just because he was expected to be a superstar.  Like... I remember when Russell Westbrook appeared in the league and he was mad exciting, but it tooks years before he became like the most talked-about guy in the league actually. I remember being kinda surprised it was so quiet about him then."
"Yeah, it's become normalized like everything. It's only an interesting number if it's an unique number, otherwise it's... just a number.  Russell Westbrook has now had three season of ""averaging triple-double"" and the first one was like 100 times more impactful in media than the next ones."
"It's still Russell Westbrook, but he's climbing his way out with his new role. He has the [lowest TS% of all players averaging 20 ppg or more](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=per_game&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=2020&amp;year_max=2020&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;qual=mp_per_g_req&amp;c1stat=pts_per_g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=20&amp;order_by=ts_pct&amp;order_by_asc=Y).

Ask Russell westbrook
Ahhh man I get so sick of explaining this.   Only three players have gotten an MVP award when their teams weren’t 1-2 seed in their conferences.   Michael Jordan 3rd seed.   Karl Malone 3rd seed but team had same record as first place team.   Russell Westbrook 6th seed but historical triple double season.   This is NBA tradition and is very seldom shied away from. Harden would have 100% won if his team was 1-2 seed in his conference. The difference between Harden and Giannis that year is that Harden was playing without CP3 and Capela for a lot of those games and willing the team to victory while at the same time putting up insane offensive numbers. He deserved the MVP that year over Giannis (in my opinion).
"It's been another level, man, but people don't understand cause they don't watch us. I always admitted Steph was at another level with the spacing he demanded, but some teams won't even let Harden touch the ball in the backcourt without two guys on him, and we have Russell Westbrook on the court..."
"they're only averaging 3 fewer rebounds per game from last year (46.2 to 42.8), and actually average more ORB's this year. Probably has something more to do with the fact that the defensive lineup isn't Klay, KD, and Iguodala anymore and there's fewer DRB's to catch.   As far as comparing Ben Wallace's rebounding numbers to Draymond's. Ben Wallace is 6'9, Draymond is 6'6.   With all that said. Has Draymond not played as he could have this year? Yes, definitely yes. But I don't think anyone walked in to this season thinking: ""Wow, with with Steph and Klay injured and with KD gone this year; Draymond Green is going to be a walking triple fucking double, transform into Russell Westbrook with James Harden shooting, and become the second unanimous MVP!!"" (an exaggeration for effect, in case that wasn't clear)  All this to say, Draymond's value has always been defense and playmaking, and hustling everywhere else.  He'll always be infinitely more valuable on a good team than he is on a bad one. None of this is ""exposing' him. Everyone knew this before coming into the season. It's like hitting January and it starts snowing and everyone's surprised for some reason"
"Chis paul, Vitor Oledepo, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving  So would all these guys. Its almost like this would be true wirh  any smaller player with handles"
"This article was published on the 17th. Lowe acknowledges and praises Russ here. Literally says ""I like this Russell Westbrook""  https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/02/17/lowe-and-torre-discuss-is-this-the-best-russell-westbrook-has-ever-played/  You wasted all that time looking through his Like and Don't Like series and missed that?"
"Just another KD (tall, can shoot anywhere, great handles, can play d, a teammate named Russell Westbrook) but with a much better playmaking abilities. Lol."
"A free win? We have one of the highest winning percentages in the entire NBA the last few years lmao. How can you be this bad at making up insults? You could have at least gone with the generic ""Harden is a choker"" or ""Russell Westbrook"" insults. Also, the last two years the Bucks and Rockets have literally made it to the second round and the conference finals, so if that makes the Rockets a free win then the Bucks would also be a free win you idiot, and the Rockets both times ran into the Warriors. Who did the Bucks run into? The starless Miami Heat, the Raptors who needed multiple injuries to the Warriors to win, the Cody Zeller led hornets?"
"It was a bit of both. Yeah there was a vibe they're gonna tank and CP3 won't even be there and even if not, that most likely some of the players will be not in form due to age/health.  Another was, though, the usual opinion around the league that Chris Paul doesn't give you that many wins. He's been regularly described as one of the worst contracts in the league. It's like, whatever the scores say, he will never be treated as for example Russell Westbrook is in that way, far from it.  And that OKC made it work to have CP3, Shai and goddam Schroeder play so well together is something that I think even the CP3 fans would not expect with certainty."
Russell Westbrook: Hits a 3 pointer   Any Commentator: Goes on about how Russell Westbrook can't shoot 3 pointers
"Imagine playing Russ on the first night of a back-to-back, knowing he's at 15 techs and there's a very real possibility that he's gonna deck the first dude that gives him an excuse.  Russell ""wish a motherfucker would"" Westbrook"
"Were they the ones who chanted ""Russell Westbrook"" at KD?"
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2020/2/24/21150618/russell-westbrook-houston-rockets-james-harden  This article breaks a bunch of it down. I can’t find the reddit post that originally discussed it. Mike encouraged him to shoot 3s and never told him to stop. Russ just moved away from it.   And I’ve said this elsewhere: Russ made the playoffs. With bad rosters. Analytics darlings sit as the best players on shitty teams watching at home every year and Russ made it leading Steven Adams and mediocre shooters across a roster. Analytics can’t solve that. His game transcends what your computer can tell you. You might actually have to watch some games
Russell Westbrook is the best playoff performer of ALL TIME pal.
Idk about “special” tech. But definitely can request things like I want the zoom air from the KD with the upper of a Kyrie. Here’s an example of Westbrook wearing custom shoes https://www.google.com/amp/s/sneakernews.com/2017/02/01/russell-westbrook-doesnt-wear-air-jordan-31/amp/
And Russell Westbrook did??
"Really close, the bench is the difference here and I think Lou Will will give them an edge surely because we can count on him getting buckets. I cant say the same for the Rockets, really is hit or miss depending if our 3's fall.   All in all, great fucking series!! Pat Beverly v Russell Westbrook  Doc v Austin Rivers  Let's hope the 3's fall for the Houston Rockets!!"
It was talked about in a book by Marcus Thompson called The miraculous rise of Steph Curry but these articles mention it   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-doesnt-like-stephen-curry-2017-4%3famp  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2702921-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-more-reportedly-hold-disdain-toward-steph-curry
"Rudy is kinda in the middle of dark skin and light skin. He’s not as light as a Russell Westbrook or Danny Green, but he isn’t as dark as a James Harden or a Shaq."
"yall just go to basketball reference and think those box score metrics are the analytics ppl r talkin about lol  in fact, russ' mvp season actually exposed major flaws in the stat that forced them to change it. so there's that  when people are talking about analytics and russell westbrook, they are referring to his shot selection and his inefficient scoring.  among the highest scoring seasons in nba history, westbrook's 2017 season is among the most inefficient ever."
I am a Russell Westbrook fan. I switched my main focus from OKC. To Houston this year. But I still love OKC more than any other team if that makes sense  For instance
"Russell Westbrook is what basketball needed. A bunch of weenies playing with no passion, giggling and shit with opposing players... enough with that. We need some dogs, I’m happy Russell Westbrook didn’t cave into this buddy buddy bullshit and I’m ecstatic the new face of the league, Giannis, isn’t like that either."
"I guess Luka’s the best player in the league then and Russell Westbrook was the best player in the league the past three seasons when he’s averaged a triple double. Stats are inflated nowadays , compare Luka’s impact on the game to Zion’s . Pelicans have been a top 10 offense and defense with Zion and way worse without him."
Russell Westbrook makes NBA players look like they dont play basketball.
I'll give you a short history about our franchise so it might help you make your decision.  &amp;#x200B;  In 2008 the Seattle Supersonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder. (Supersonics fans hate our team)  Our General Manager selected MVP in 3 consecutive drafts.  2007- Kevin Durant   2008- Russell Westbrook  2009- James Harden  Durant and Westbrook were great from the start and quickly made all star/all nba teams  Harden was an excellent sixth man and even won 6th man of the year  In 2012 we made the finals with Durant Westbrook and Harden all being young great players.  Harden wanted a max contract extension in the summer of 2012 (after the finals) but our owner didnt want to pay him the max so he made our gm trade him. (one of the worst trades in NBA History)
Portland fans will probably agree with these:  Raymond Felton Russell Westbrook Robert Horry Anyone wearing a Lakers jersey Clay Bennett The Thunder and Nuggets fan base as a whole
"For perspective, my favorite players ever are Kobe, Bill Russell, Westbrook, and Larry Bird. Bill Russell seems like the ""one is not like the others"" choice there, but not really. He had such a killer's mentality, like MJ and Kobe, but from a defensive standpoint.  So I have a similar lens as you. I'm not sure I'm recalling the same game as you, but I remember similar instances. The 2012 all-star game comes to mind as well as the game Kobe had against the Heat the following week. I do too believe the players.  I agree 100% with your assessment of Steph. I think he is an all-time great player, but I truly believe he is the one superstar that benefits the most from the era he plays in. I have a hard time believing he would be as good in more physical eras. I think guys like Giannis, Durant, Westbrook, and AD would more or less be the same players in the past they are today.  Guys like Giannis and Westbrook would be more appreciated honestly.  As for Harden, I despise him so much. I'm not the type of guy that roots for other players to fail, but the less I see him succeed, the happier I am. In my opinion, he is a stain on the NBA record book.  I do place value on guys that use their teammates appropriately so I don't discredit the Magics and LeBrons, I just sort of give the MJs and Kobes ""extra credit"" for being able to singlehandly annihilate another team."

"It doesn't, Paul George and Russell Westbrook were playing injured in that series. They both had surgeries after the series was done and people still shit all over them, so why would people expect that excuse to stop the OKC fans from shitting on them."
"Which 3-gaurd lineup fares better?  CP3, SGA, Schroeder  Or Eric Gordon, Ben McLemore and Chris Clemons?  OKC prolly has an edge.  But the Rockets frontcourt of James Harden at PF and Russell Westbrook at center is waaaaay better than Gallo and Adams.  Rockets in some kind of sweep."
Find urself a second option like Russell Westbrook
Mike Conley just became exactly whatever the opposite of Russell Westbrook is this year.
Russell Westbrook ?
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook good
I don't think I've ever told anyone but I think I'm in love with Russell Westbrook
We have Russell fucking Westbrook and James fucking Harden and the seats aren’t filled. Embarrassing
Russell Westbrook scored 20 points in the paint this first half...
You can’t put a guard on Russell fucking Westbrook in 2020. You will get roasted.   Also this defense can work because of how active Russ has been everywhere on that end
Carmelo Anthony Davis or Bill Russell Westbrook?
This version of Russell Westbrook is unstoppable
I FUCKING LOVE RUSSELL WESTBROOK  *do not check my post history*
Russell Westbrook doesn't use turn signals.
Reminds me of this video breaking down the different ways Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook fall/land. Zion’s landing here is exactly what they show Derrick Rose doing as the what not to do.   https://youtu.be/S_rdO8OLHZo
"Idk about that. Explosiveness can make a big difference.   Melo is a better pure scorer than Bron, but the more explosive Bron average(d) more   Damian Lillard is a far more polished scorer than the more explosive Russell Westbrook, but they average the same   Also don’t forget that while Tatum has the edge from 3, Brown is right up there career % wise. Tatum at 39%, Brown at 37. And from the field , bc of that athleticism edge, Brown always shoots a higher %"
1. Lebron 2. Giannis 3. Damien Lilliard 4. James Harden 5. Russell Westbrook
Most regular-season games falling one rebound short:  1. Magic Johnson — 46  2. Oscar Robertson — 43  3. Jason Kidd — 37  4. LeBron James — 26  5. Russell Westbrook — 23  6. Larry Bird — 19
Your GM traded four draft picks for Russell Westbrook and you have one of the cheapest owners in the league.  It's really only a matter of time now until your team becomes trash
"No, but Russell Westbrook says hi to all of us at /r/nba"
"That's a big if. And again...Less possessions mean less shots and more pressure to hit even bigger shots.   You are okay with Russell Westbrook taking 3s, and if Eric Gordon beats you by going nuts on fire scoring 35-40, you can live with that too."
"It's an interesting point, but there's a lot of personnel that has to be there for this to work.  You need a James Harden kind of guy that can do whatever he wants with the defense and get the team whatever shots they want. Most teams don't have a legendary scorer/playmaker like that. Also, a lot of why this works is because Harden gets doubled so much. You have to find someone who attracts that much defensive attention.  You need a Russell Westbrook who is super athletic and strong and can just get to the rim at ease while being quick. Also, this player has to be a really good drive and kick player, which Russ is.  You need a Draymond-PJ type small-ball 5, which are rare. These guys have to be able to defend all positions extremely well, have high defensive IQ off-ball, and space the floor by being a good enough 3 point shooter.  You need other skilled lengthy 3nD wings like Roco and House. Again, a RoCo type player is very rare.  Basically all of the role players have to have some size to them to not be a defensive liability, and some have to be elite defenders at all positions. All the role players have to be able to shoot 3s. Even the stars have to be able to defend all 5 positions well and have to be larger/stronger than your typical guard."

"basically they are on of the oldest teams, not quite as old as pistons or kings that predate the nba, or boston and knicks that were in the nba from year 1 but they are an old guard team  they started as the st louis hawks and they drafted bob petit, one of the first star players of the league, and a sort of grandfsther of the classical power forward archetype that has evolved last decade  a smaller interior player who orovided some spacing with 2 pointers and a bit more speed than the center while being the co pilot of protecting the paint and rebounding  he also loved all star games and won a lot of all star mvps back then amd was a sort of bridge star from the mikan pre clock shot first years of the league to the russel, chamberlaim, west, Big O first big generation of legendary stars  the hawks then drafted bill russell, one of the greates players of all time and traded him for a good player in bob mccauley that helped petit beat the celtics to the title in the 60's  it was hawks first and only championship and 1 of the only 2 years in a 13 year period where boston didnt win the ring for 11 championships with russell  they went to atlanta and were bad for a good while until the 80's when they got a french bron hall of fame wing dominique wilkins remembered for his scoring prowess, dunk contest duels being robbed by jordan amd coming back from a torm achiles which was unheard of at the time  they built really good but not great teams in the 90s around older post injury wilkins   they sucked again in the 00's but made some pretty solid teams in the late 00's with al horford ex great player who spends his time on soxers bench these days, josh smith dominant athlete with a westbrook 3 point shooting complex at  30% ish who once randomly became curry with a different team to elimimate the championship contender  2015 clippers and beloved ultra skilled gunslimger joe johnson who was not worth his contract but was still fun as hell and was a clutch shot god  they became bad again then randomly replaced joe johnson and josh smith with underated specialist role players and won 60 games and had their whole starting five make the all star and win a player of the month award, arguably the most succesful in reg season team withput a star ever that then was swept by lebron in playoffs  that is pretty much it  also connie hawkins a college star who was unfairly accused of betting against hinself on college and blackballed from the nba made his delayed nba debut im the hawks which is cool"
Oh yeah Russell Westbrook choked when Paul George went 2-16 in an elimination game? Lmao that’s rough but you can’t place the blame on a player who averaged 30 a game that series
"Lowe on Westbrook literally ten days ago:   *""Objectively speaking, this feels like the best basketball of Russell Westbrook’s life. Obviously, his MVP season, when the numbers would sort of suggest it that OK, maybe it was then. But in terms of being the most efficient Russ, this feels like right now, that is the answer. The year he won the MVP, he didn’t have anyone nearly of his own caliber on his team so he had to do all these other things. Playing next to Harden makes his life a little easier, but this is as efficient he’s ever been""*"
Lowe picked the Rockets to win the title when very few people were picking them.   He also said only a few days ago that this is the best version of Russell Westbrook ever.
"It was done to neuter Russell Westbrook, lol."
"RIP Russell Westbrook, died too soon 🙏🙏🙏"
"&gt; Why was BPM changed?  &gt; The simplest answer: Russell Westbrook. Westbrook's 2016-17 MVP season graded out at 15.6 in the original BPM. Essentially, his 10.7 RPG and 10.4 APG broke the interaction terms between those statistics. So Westbrook's great season ended up being 20% better than any other season in the database, which just didn't pass the smell test.  Damn."
"I mean according to 538 Alex Caruso and Javale are both better than Marcus Morris, Gordon Hayward, Russell Westbrook, Serge, you get my point. Markieff is definitely a positive asset compared to Jeff Green who shot 39% from the field."
"Depends on what you mean by ""do better."" Their individual stats would be better, because you don't have to share the ball without another star on the court, but the team would definitely not ""do better."" Embiid and Simmons aren't the cleanest fit, but it's not as bad as national media/fans want it to be.. narrative is way overblown - the problem is they have been trying weird stuff around these two.. the coach has been trying to shoehorn Horford as a stretch 4, and Tobi/JRich haven't been spacing the floor as well as hoped.  You could make this similar argument for any team with two star players.. for example, obviously they're a good fit but, I'm sure Steph Curry would have better stats with Klay Thompson off the court, that doesn't mean the team would be better off splitting them. It's just the nature of the game.. Russell Westbrook was an MVP without Durant, but his team also got bounced in the first round of the playoffs that year."

"Kawhi didn't really have to go up against that tough of competition:  Round 1: Nikola Vucevic  Round 2: Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons  Round 3: Giannis and Khris Middleton  Finals: Steph Curry, and a few games of Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant.  &amp;#x200B;  Dirk went through:  Round 1: LaMarcus Aldridge, Brandon Roy  Round 2: Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum  Round 3: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden  Finals: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh  He faced 3 of the top 5 players in the NBA (Kobe, LeBron and Wade, the other two being Dwight Howard and Derrick Rose)."
"Man I love Russell Westbrook. Definitely my favourite non-Raptor, he's just so fun to watch"
I miss Russell Westbrook almost as much as I miss basketball.
"I also value differences in defenses between eras. Kobe was tearing up the league and averaging 35+ during an era when perimeter defenses were stifling. How many elite perimeter players did Jordan go against? Reggie Miller? Uh....Kobe faced: AI, TMac, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Carmelo, Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, Dwyane Wade...list goes on, almost every night it’s a tough perimeter matchup. These are all time players. Jordan dominated an era dominated by big men. And even the elimination of hand checking and illegal defenses changed things. Kobe/Lebron have faced tougher teams and tougher dogs on the perimeter than Jordan did. Just my two cents."
"**PG** Russell Westbrook, Nick Van Exel  **SG** Latrell Sprewell, JR Smith, Ricky Davis  **SF** Peja Stojakovic, Danilo Gallinari  **PF** Rasheed Wallace, David Lee  **C** DeMarcus Cousins, Kurt Thomas, DeJuan Blair  Head coach: definitely Jeff Van Gundy.

"Fun fact: If Russell Westbrook wins a ring this year AND next year, he would still have less rings than Steph Curry."
"Man, I'd have loved to see Russell Westbrook play for the Sunshine"
"Kobe wins 5 more rings. LeBron, seeing this, realizes he needed a start PG not a SG &amp; PF combo and he teams up with Steve Nash on the Knicks. It turns out, the curse of the Knicks affects everyone and btoh get injured and retire early. Because of this, Cleveland never wins a title and, eventually, the NBA moves the team to Seattle to make up for the Thunders move. Kevin DUrant, seeing this and wanting to make up for Seattle's hurt, signs to the Seattle Cavaliers and wins 3 rings. Russell Westbrook, upset at Durant's success outside of OKC and without him, signs to the Celtics and tries to match Bull Russell's championship resume.... AND HE SUCCEEDS! Westbrook is then named the true GOAT. With an uncountable amount of rings and triple doubles, only one player has the chance to match his resume    [and that player is....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX7vRertYQs)"
"&gt;""Wasn't gonna pass to him anyways..."" - Russell Westbrook  That aged poorly"
Dennis Smith Jr. is the next Russell Westbrook...
Thunder easy. They already have a better record right now than Portland and they also got 6 picks for Paul George and a few others for Russell Westbrook. It’s not close.
Tell that to Russell Westbrook and his triple double rampage

Younger Russell Westbrook is one of the most explosive athletes ever. Amazing to watch.
Russell Westbrook is a bitch
Russell Westbrook + Joel Embiid just for the entertainment

I would have loved to have seen what happens if he did something like this to Russell Westbrook.
The most Russell Westbrook moment of all time.
Thought for sure that Emmanuel Mudiay was the next Russell Westbrook ☹️
How many rims would Russell Westbrook have destroyed if he played in that era.
"Yeah, it's weird. I couldn't find a list that is both comprehensive and updated. Even Basketball-Reference, for some reason, only shows the top 13. I arrived at the number by basically finding a list of TDs on, of all places, NBA India website, which updated in December.  I then Googled Luka's career TD number (which was 22) and determined that he would be #20.  [This is](https://in.nba.com/news/most-triple-doubles-in-nba-history-oscar-robertson-russell-westbrook-ben-simmons/cyw8d7ue47wt17x5vsu667767) the webpage, if you're interested."
They thought they were playing russell Westbrook still.
“I’d rather have terry rozier than Russell Westbrook” was a real thing multiple people were saying during the 2018 playoffs
All Time Top 20  Michael Jordan  Wilt Chamberlain  LeBron James  Magic Johnson  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Larry Bird  Op  Bill Russell  Tim Duncan  Shaquille O’Neal  Kobe Bryant  Hakeem Olajuwon  Moses Malone  Kevin Durant  Kevin Garnett  Julius Erving  me  Jerry West  Oscar Robertson  Karl Malone  Stephen Curry  Steve Nash  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  David Robinson  Isiah Thomas  John Stockton
He shot more than Russell Westbrook did in the Finals you're quoting.
What do you mean? He didn't do anything in the off-season? He traded for former MVP Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook of course
"No particular order, just as I think of them.  MJ, LeBron, Kobe, Duncan, Bird, Wilt, Russell, KD, Kareem, Magic, Hakeem, Steph, Malone, Shaq, Charles, AI, Reggie, Dirk, Wade, Stockton, Garnett, Robertson, Robinson, Nash, McHale, Paul, Harden, Westbrook, Pippen, Baylor, Erving, Havlicek, Allen, Melo, Pierce  There's 35 guys comfortably better than Vince, and I'm sure there's a lot I forgot."
Nice job comparing Russell Westbrook to a role player valued for his defense
"It only matters when you rank retired players. Even now, if you started a team and had the choice between a 19yo Westbrook, Harden or Leonard for the next 10 years knowing that their careers would pan out the same, you would still not take Leonard. Besides being a late bloomer, availability is the best ability.   It's kinda like Russell vs Champerlain. At some point, winning stops becoming the point when a player is clearly better. Kawhi did make huge strides forward offensively, but at the same time he took 3 steps back defensevily. We'll see how his career pans out"
99% would be amazing rugby players. Fuck me JJ  Redick would be taller than half the team  Edit: since I’m bored as fuck  Nba starting 15 1. Draymond Green 2. PJ Tucker 3. Zion Williamson 4. Ruby Gobert 5. Anthony Davis 6. Paul George  7. Jimmy Butler 8. Giannis Antetokoumpo 9. Steph Curry 10. Dame Lillard 11. Russell Westbrook 12. Donovan Mitchell  13. Lebron James 14. Klay Thompson 15. Ben Simmons
"One of my favourite games to games to watch.  Donovan dropping 38 points alongside an amazing 3rd quarter filled with scoop shots and eurosteps giving me prime Wade vibes.  Russell Westbrook carrying the Thunder with 48/5/10 filled with pull up 3s and great passes to Adams in the post.  Imo, what really sealed it was te Derrick Favors mid range at 1:10 to go (8:50 on the video). PG played amazing D and could have gotten a stop and the lead but Favors hits the mid.  The foul on PG was pretty controversial, even Snyder flinched thinking it would be called. Imo they wouldve called that in regular season."
"I'm gonna go out on a limb and say uhh Russell Westbrook is not James Jones. Idk why you made this argument something along the lines of ""Yeah Robert Horry won 7 rings, should we put him ahead of Michael Jordan?"" lol. I was stunned for a minute there"
"Ok I found the measurement you’re talking about, Shams did say that, but the new measurements also have Serge as a 7 footer and KD is clearly taller or as tall as him    https://www.google.com/search?q=kevin+durant+height+next+to&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjF0Jm7q63oAhUBiqwKHZ2bBbYQ2-cCegQIABAC&amp;oq=kevin+durant+height+next+to&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-img.3..33i299l3.2275.7837..8026...6.0..0.145.3048.23j10......0....1.........41j0i5i30j0i8i30j0j0i131j0i13j0i8i13i30j0i24.jqKky_3QUf4&amp;ei=R_Z2XoWRBoGUsgWdt5awCw&amp;bih=635&amp;biw=375&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us#imgrc=jQrergt_wJyZRM   https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-and-serge-ibaka-of-the-oklahoma-city-picture-id153310830"

For reference Russell Westbrook has been touted as extremely inefficient and a chucker and his career average is 53%.  They're completely different eras.  Do you think Steve Nash would only have a 60% TS in our current era?  Hell no, because different parts of the game as emphasized.  There's a reason why you compare a player to their era, and how great that was and then compare that to others.  We don't make fun of MJ for not having a great 3 point %(32) because it wasn't emphasized during his era.  However, Lebron gets some heat for his 34%."
Nah it’s Russell Westbrook
Kevin Durant  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Paul George  Victor Oladipo
you’re gonna get on al gore’s internet to say that bob cousy is better than russell westbrook?
Russell Westbrook but im a borderline zoomer
\- Russell Westbrook after a game he shot 6/20 from the field in
when you see a Russell Westbrook ripping opposing players heads off with ruthless slams it probably wouldn’t be too hard
"Even so my point still stands. He's never really been considered an elite point guard in the same tier as a Steph Curry, Damien Lillard or Russell Westbrook up until he won last year even though his level of play never really warranted it. That's not to say that he was bad but he certainly wasn't elite."
You mean Typhoid gonna come down with a case of Russell Westbrook
"""Russell Westbrook would average a triple double if he played for the sixers""  Flashback to the 2014-2015 NBA season. MCW was averaging 14.6/5.3/6.7 in his sophomore season, however he was generally regarded as an empty stats player.  Kevin Durant was out for most of the season, only playing 27 games on the season.  In KD's absence, Russ, who was regarded as a ballhog who should be playing SG, KD's sidekick, and a finals choker, put up 28.1/7.3/8.6 in his first season as the number 1 option.  I was telling everyone who would listen at my high school/in the BR comment section that Westbrook would easily average a triple double on the sixers if MCW can put up 14.6/5.3/6.7. I got soooo shat on though, Oscar Rob's triple double season was something mythical akin to Wilt's 100-point game, no one thought it could be replicated in the modern NBA."

"Jordan: Ewing, Reggie Miller, Charles Barkley, Penny Hardaway, Larry Johnson, Brad Daugherty, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Mark Price  Players who won rings but when Jordan was retired: Clyde Drexler, Alonzo Mourning, Gary Payton   Kobe: Reggie Miller, Chris Webber, Grant Hill, Steve Nash, Yao Ming, Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Aamare Stodoumire  LeBron James: Demar DeRozan, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Derrick Rose, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Victor Oladipo  Unlike Jordan, pretty much all of LeBron’s rivals “ate” in his era. That’s probably one of the biggest knocks against him."
I’m probably older than a majority of the subreddit and from what I remember that’s sort of true. He was way more highly regarded years ago than today. Russell Westbrook probably had a hand in slightly tarnishing his legacy by averaging a triple-double.
Russell Westbrook
James Harden led Houston to an 11-6 record in 2015-16 when Joey Dorsey (who had been out of the league for three seasons and was out immediately after) started. LeBron James led a dogshit Cavaliers team to the Finals in 2018. Russell Westbrook led an underwhelming roster to 47 wins and a playoff spot in 2016-17. MVP players lead their teams to success despite considerable handicaps.

Russell Westbrook - Berserk Wool Sluts
Like when the entire OKC team would just block out the opposing team to let Russell Westbrook get the rebound.
"iLoveYouLonzo did it, yours was good though too.  * Head coach: nick nurse * Steph Curry * James Harden * Lebron * Kawhi or KD * Giannis * Anthony Davis * Paul George * Chris Paul * Damian Lillard * Bradley Beal * Russell Westbrook * Trae Young * Pascal Siakam * Zion Williamson * Edit: this is only first names, I can’t read"
"Sounds like the start of every NBA 2K MyPlayer mode.  ""Why is this 71 overall with green afro taking time away from Russell Westbrook?"".  You keep on playing him though OP because he'll end the season as All Star, MVP, ROTY, All-NBA, and world champion while averaging 45+ PPG."

Yes. I played with Russell Westbrook when he was in High School at a local part and score 4 points on him. That’s gotta count for something
"Ahh yes, the Russell Westbrook strategy"
"Fair enough they’re jump shooting stats look to be pretty similar, but looking at FG % on player drives John wall is at 51% on 6.3 FGA with 16.9 drives per game and Russell Westbrook is at 44% on 6.2 FGA with 20.1 drives per game. Isn’t that indicative of John Wall being much more efficient on his drives to the hoop and around the basket? Especially considering both of the these guys spend majority of their time driving to the hoop.   Adams is a legit top 7-8 big man in the nba, Roberson was a top 3-4 perimeter defender in the nba, Victor Oladipo at the time was still a very good player, Taj Gibson was also a very good PF, Doug Mcdermot  was a legit sharp shooter, Jerami Grant was another awesome athlete that could defend 1-5 and provide vertical spacing, Enes Kanter was one of the best rebounders in the league and could score pretty well around the rim. These are all very good players, even when you compare to the likes of Bradley Beal, Markieff Morris, Gortat, Porter and Oubre I’d say the thunder were deeper. I do agree that Washington has better spacing but the overall talent level on both teams were similar. Westbrook has guys that did all the dirty work and Wall has guys who could space the floor.   Russell took a bigger role in the offense because that’s who he is, even when he had all star teammates who could pick up the slack his usage was always pretty high. Even now with harden on his team, he still has a higher usage rate than wall did in 2017. If you give wall the same amount of usage as Westbrook I’d argue he’d put up similar if not better stats. I think both guys garnered the same amount of respect from opposing defenses,nobody took either of these guys lightly   Wall was legit one of the best decisions makers/iq guys in the nba. Russell Westbrook was one of the worst at least among guards and especially among all star guards. I think the gap is pretty big."
"&gt; Well he was a better shooter, a better finisher around the rim... and was overall more efficient  John Wall 16-17  Midrange: 38.7%  3PT%: 32.7%  Restricted Area: 58.6%  TS%: 54.1%  Russell Westbrook 16-17:  Midrange: 36.3%  3PT%: 34.3%  Restricted Area: 57.2%  TS%: 55.4%  Really the difference in their shooting numbers is negligible. Russ was overall more efficient while having much worse spacing and teammates than Wall (Adams/Gibson/Roberson/Oladipo vs Beal/Porter/Morris/Gortat) Russ also had to take a much bigger role in the offense than Wall and was a bigger focus of opposing defenses. Had a higher TS% while taking on a much bigger scoring load.  I'll give you that Wall was a better passer/decision maker but I don't think the gap is as big as you're making it out to be. Wall isn't THAT good of a decision maker and he was mostly a reputation defender."
"What tons of others per capita? And again, you think every racist belongs to a group sheesh. Im talking about Houston specifically, not all of Texas. If we are doing state to state, yea Texas as a whole is probably more racist. Really, it was just Russel Westbrook?

"You think the amount of white nationalist groups (not just the kkk, tons of others) per capita in a teams market and the historical fact that Texas has been a racist ass place in the past isn’t a better way to judge then one experience Russell Westbrook had? You should take your own advice and don’t be stupid"
Russell Westbrook is the Hassan Whiteside of point guards his stats are meaningless and his teams will never win anything
"Anthony Davis to the Lakers for the majority of their roster and Russell Westbrook to the Rockets for Chris Paul and a truckload of picks.

"Of course, so was Rajon Rondo, Derrick Rose, Tony Parker, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving. That doesn't mean any of them were better."
"Reggie Jackson for sure.  Ibaka also said:  &gt; But then, Ibaka’s efficiency dropped, as did his scoring and his rebounds, and following the 2015-16 season, he was traded to the Orlando Magic. “I’m gonna tell you the truth, it’s hard sometimes when you play hard, you play you’re (butt off),” Ibaka said in his final season with Westbrook in a not-too-veiled comment about the star. “You play so hard on defense, then you come to offense and you’re going to be out there in the corner for 4, 5, 6, sometimes 8 minutes and you don’t touch the ball. We human, man. It’s hard.”  Kevin Martin too.  &gt; Kevin Martin never took to being a score-first shooting guard trying to share the ball with Russell Westbrook after stepping in for an elite player. Signing after James Harden walked following almost being the unanimous choice for the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year, Martin was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves after just a single season with the Thunder in 2012-13. Of his new club up North, Martin noted “this is such a fun team to play on. Nobody is trying to lead the league in scoring here.”  It's happened. But most people don't do it or at least don't say his name because of the above."

Nina and Russell Westbrook
"It's not just the Bucks or Clippers this season. Dudes like James Harden and Russell Westbrook have carried sub-par rosters with little to no shot-creation aside from themselves to the playoffs. They're actual MVP players. You can place a bunch of shooters/defenders with zero other offensive skills around players like that and they'd make the playoffs. Davis lacks the playmaking ability and scoring self-creation to do that.   &gt; And Jokic is surrounded by a pretty good team as well, so does that mean we can downplay his success as well? You can’t have it both ways.  No, since the team goes from elite with him playing to barely treading water without him.   &gt; Uhhh, what?  Davis isn't an elite playmaker, he's not a great shooter, and the vast majority of his buckets are assisted. He isn't the offensive powerhouse that someone like LeBron or Jokic is. A big isn't gonna lead your team to a championship-level offense in today's NBA unless he possesses skills like Jokic, who is one of the most unique players ever."
"So why is it that LeBron can keep the Lakers a top-tier team without Davis but the reverse isn't true? Even if the Lakers' role players are mostly just shooters/defenders, any elite player should be able to carry them to at least mediocrity. LeBron James, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and actual elite players have been doing it for years."
"Idk, 2 years ago I was still dealing with being a Jason Terry fan.  4 years ago you tell me Jason Terry, CP3, Austin Rivers, Tyson Chandler and Russell Westbrook will all play for the Rockets...idk what I'd say man."

"I mean, I think the answer to that is that most players LeBron's size don't have the ballhandling and passing skills to make as many passes as LeBron does. The whole thing about LeBron is that he has the skills to be a primary ballhandler and playmaker, with SF/PF size and strength.   If simply being taller made it easier to get assists, you wouldn't expect the league leaders in assists to be dominated by guards. But look at the leader going back to '86:   LeBron James	10.60	LAL  2018-19	NBA	Russell Westbrook	10.74	OKC  2017-18	NBA	Russell Westbrook	10.25	OKC  2016-17	NBA	James Harden	11.20	HOU  2015-16	NBA	Rajon Rondo	11.65	SAC  2014-15	NBA	Chris Paul	10.22	LAC  2013-14	NBA	Chris Paul	10.69	LAC  2012-13	NBA	Rajon Rondo	11.05	BOS  2011-12	NBA	Rajon Rondo	11.70	BOS  2010-11	NBA	Steve Nash\*	11.40	PHO  2009-10	NBA	Steve Nash\*	11.01	PHO  2008-09	NBA	Chris Paul	11.04	NOH  2007-08	NBA	Chris Paul	11.56	NOH  2006-07	NBA	Steve Nash\*	11.63	PHO  2005-06	NBA	Steve Nash\*	10.46	PHO  2004-05	NBA	Steve Nash\*	11.48	PHO  2003-04	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	9.22	NJN  2002-03	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	8.89	NJN  2001-02	NBA	Andre Miller	10.89	CLE  2000-01	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	9.78	PHO  1999-00	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	10.12	PHO  1998-99	NBA	Jason Kidd\*	10.78	PHO  1997-98	NBA	Rod Strickland	10.54	WAS  1996-97	NBA	Mark Jackson	11.40	TOT  1995-96	NBA	John Stockton\*	11.17	UTA  1994-95	NBA	John Stockton\*	12.33	UTA  1993-94	NBA	John Stockton\*	12.57	UTA  1992-93	NBA	John Stockton\*	12.04	UTA  1991-92	NBA	John Stockton\*	13.73	UTA  1990-91	NBA	John Stockton\*	14.20	UTA  1989-90	NBA	John Stockton\*	14.54	UTA  1988-89	NBA	John Stockton\*	13.63	UTA  1987-88	NBA	John Stockton\*	13.76	UTA  1986-87	NBA	Magic Johnson\*	12.21	LAL  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron is the tallest league leader in assists since Magic. Most of these guys are 6'3"" or shorter. Magic is really the only comparable playmaker at that size. But he was quite an outlier himself.   So, you could look at LeBron's height as being an advantage, but it is only an advantage if you still have the skills to run the point. Is it less impressive somehow because LeBron is so big? One could argue that it is more impressive- I could turn it around and say, of course John Stockton was so skilled at running plays, he had to be to make it as a 6'1"" guy. Would he have developed those skills if he were a 6'8"" guy who could dunk from the free throw line?  Go back and watch LeBron high school videos, he had an enormous size and athleticism advantage over his opponents. Unlike a 6'1"" guard, he could have neglected to learn basketball IQ and ballhandling and passing. He could have easily just been a run and dunk player and been fairly successful. How did he become a player who would lead the league in assists?  I just don't agree that it's not impressive somehow- If it were that simple, someone would have done it before. But there hasn't been a player similar to LeBron before."

I kinda get [Eazy-E](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Eazy_E_headshot_%28cropped%29.jpg) vibes from [Westbrook](https://cavsnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Russell-Westbrook.jpg).
Russell Westbrook I thought he was a whiny hypersensitive douche and hated him in the early Durant Westbrook years but after Durant left and he talked about wanting to stay in OKC I got a lot more respect for him and his game. Then I learned he was a really cool guy off the court too and now I'm buying his shoes lol
"Magic and Jordan dominted All-NBA 1st until 1991. Let's see what happens in 1991 and onwards, shall we?   1991 Stockton All-NBA 3rd behind Kevin Johnson and Clyde Drexler.   1992 Stockton All-NBA 2nd with Tim Hardaway, behind Clyde Drexler.   1993 Stockton All-NBA 2nd with Joe Dumars, behind Mark Price.   1994 Stockton All-NBA 1st finally. And again in 1995.   1996 Stockton All-NBA 2nd with Gary Payton, behind Penny Hardaway.   1997 Stockton All-NBA 3rd behind Tim Hardaway, Gary Payton and Mitch Richmond.      Imagine Russell Westbrook lost All-NBA team spot to Mitch Richmond or Mark Price. He's already not loved. He'd be getting crucified for it.      No, Stockton was never a top player. No, Stockton didn't play against better PG competition. Look at those names he lost to, and tell me it's better than Curry, CP3 and Lillard. Stockton is a great number 2, probably one of the best ones you can ask for. But his career outlook is heavily overrated by his longevity."
"&gt; CP3 well in his 30's constantly battling injuries is closer to his prime than a 29-30 year old Westbrook.  I never said CP3 was in his prime either.  CP3 being better now isn't saying he's in his prime.  &gt;Westbrook led an elite offense that also included KD and Harden, at one point. But Rose and Iverson didn't even though they had Theo Radcliffe and Luol Deng, comparatively-- then go on to say the game isn't 1v1 while ignoring that lol.  Westbrook led an elite offense with neither of these players on court.  Iverson led a league average offense at his peak.  Rose was somewhere in between but had such a short prime.  &gt;And going from a top-tier contender to a completely playoff scrub is because 29/30 year old Russ is just old not because KD was no longer there or anything.  This doesn't really tell me anything other than KD is good?  Like yeah, Westbrook had 1 prime year after that and he was really good.  End of day he's better than Iverson, but played in a tougher conference.  Iverson...wasn't as good.  I'm not actually having a fit, just I don't look at basketball with that simplistic of a view.  I legitimately thought people were well beyond that but I guess not.  The entire premise of ""I'm throwing out advanced statistics because they're not perfect but using counting stats that were created 50 years ago"" is a wild take if your eye test tells you Russell Westbrook is still in his prime.    Honestly I'd block you at this point but I'd rather just debunk bad arguments first because I'd expect this level of analysis out of someone who was in the 1990s or who just started following basketball.  Its just something that I'd hoped people had moved past long ago but I guess not.  Feel free to do the same b/c I'm all for civility and whatnot but this was just...bad.  Not because of the players involved but because using a slash line to define a player is always bad analysis."
The best way to see which players try the hardest is to simply watch the game closely.   Harden lazy on D.  Russell Westbrook goes hard sometimes to his determination.

"Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Chris Bosh, Russell Westbrook atm, and Goran Dragic in recent times"
Luka is an inefficient ball dominant player. Westbrook was better than him last season and nobody had Russell top 5
"Disagree with a lot of this.  1. Luka has been put in the PG position since his first day in the NBA, you cannot argue he is a different position under any circumstances. He's listed as a PG in the NBA, he got into the All-Star team as a guard, he's going to be in All-NBA as a guard. He is *not* a SF, he never has, and he never will. He has to be top 3 in this list. 2. Kyrie is injury-prone and has proven to be a cancer to teams he is with. He's not the best right now (Lillard and Curry are above him), he's not a significant amount younger than them (1 year younger than Lillard and 2 of Curry), and Luka and Trae very well could end up better than him in 3 years. I'd put him 5th. 3. I have seen no progress on Simmons getting a jumpshot in his time in the league, and until that happens, or a team gets built around him (which we also have seen no signs of happening), he's not going to be in the top 10 on offense, which is a significant problem for the main ballhandler. Defense at the PG spot is nowhere near as important as offense. He shouldn't be in the top 5.  4. Steph is only going to be 33, and his playstyle is one that translates well with age and isn't so athleticism-based. I don't see him dropping off *that much* in the next 3 years unless he gets injured again (which could happen), and he's the best PG in the league right now. 5. Lillard is the 2nd-best PG in the league right now, and the best currently healthy one. He has no injury concerns and will only be 32 in 3 years. There is no reason he should be below Simmons, and arguments can be made over Young.  Here's how I'd rank them:  1. Curry 2. Lillard 3. Doncic 4. Young 5. Irving 6. Simmons 7. Morant 8. Walker 9. Westbrook (arguments can be made to move him over Morant but I have a low personal opinion of him, won't argue against it) 10. Russell/Fox"
1. Luka Doncic 1. Trae Young  2. Ben Simmons 3. Steph Curry 4. Ja Morant 5. Damian Lillard 6. De'Aaron Fox 7. Kendrick Nunn  8. Russell Westbrook 9. LaMelo Ball
"It's not just mentality that separates the two but motor. MJ just seemed to constantly go all out, no matter what. His motor was Russell Westbrook. I suppose you could argue that is mentality but I would have to say it is endurance.   Lebron never had that in him."
Russell Westbrook is a great example of this. He pulls back on all his jumpers including from 3 and has a money elbow jumper but is historically bad from deeper range for a volume shooter
"If Masai decided to give up Pascal, FVV and multiple first rounders for PG13 who was going to need double shoulder surgery and Russell Westbrook, I would just go from having the Pistons as my secondary team to my primary team. We all knew that Kawhi was using the Raptors as leverage when it came to playing with PG13. The Raptors had a better chance of becoming a dynasty just by resigning Kawhi Leonard without trading for Westbrook and PG"

***sweats in Russell Westbrook
"Any question about ""which NBA player would be the best at *insert sport here*"", the answer should be Russell Westbrook. Dude is 6'3"" with a 6'6"" wingspan, insanely quick on his feet and explosive. He's the most athletic player in the league imo and would dominate basically any sport.  100m dash? Pole vaulting? Volleyball? Soccer? Water polo? Imagine Westbrook in a swimming cap, exploding 3 feet in the air, spiking the ball into a net. Westbrook is a beast."
"""Russell Westbrook eats an 1/8th of mushrooms before game"""
"Not anymore.  Giannis, Zion, Simmons, Morant, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Derrick Jones Jr, Malik Beasley, Aaron Gordon, LaVine, Hamidou Diallo, and even current LeBron are all more explosive.   Westbrook’s gotten older. He’s 31, and one of the first thing that falls off as a guard is foot speed and explosiveness and this is no exception for Russell.   What’s really impressive about Westbrook isn’t really his athleticism, but his relentless motor and balls to the wall approach. Westbrook will dart to the rim for a tough finish over 7-footers without even a hint of fear, and that’s a skill that only gets more impressive as he ages."
"""Russell Westbrook realizes he has legs"""
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIz9YoDvuhU  0:57, 1:15, 1:35, 1:57, 2:07, 2:17, 2:59 (probably his best IMHO), 3:21 (utter demolition of Alonzo)  Carter's elevation was noticeable and renowned but what stands out to me is his power and ferocity. He wasn't the biggest guy, physically but the viciousness of his rim attacks and the sheer tenacity he attacked it with added a new element. Russell Westbrook dunks the same way, I feel, with unhinged fury."
"He doesn't have a Russell Westbrook, that's for sure"
you have russell westbrook on your team and you're talking trash about shooting? lol
"That James Harden is some catastrophically awful playoff performer. His performance does slip overall and he did record arguably the worst playoff game by a superstar in recent memory (Game 6 against San Antonio in the 2017 semifinals), but he's led the Rockets to the most success of any Western Conference team besides Golden State since 2015. He's played next to Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and none of them and had success each time."
"&gt;Then he played 42 games in game 5 haha, why did you leave that part out? It’s about rotations too, not just the mins played.   lol not out of negligence and fact skewing, but because it wasn't relevant to the point i was making  &gt; Why do you think he won it? Genuine question  same reason we both said he won it, narrative. Are you arguing that Iggy was more valuable to the 2015 warriors than Curry was?  &gt;Wait vs Raptors? Lol no he wasn’t. It’s very rare to lose and be in talks for finals mvp, that’s how good Lebron was to even get votes. You have to be vastly superior than everyone else and Curry definitely wasn’t in that series. Lebron had the most points, rebounds and assists for both teams in that series, that’s a rare feat and he did it twice. He also isn’t a sieve on defense like Curry  Bron also averaged 4 TO's a game and shot sub 40% for the series. Sure, of course hes gonna put up great counting stats bc there were no other all stars, but his efficiency and playmaking dropped significantly. If the most valuable player was the one who had the best box score, but shitty effiency and TO count and loses anyway, then it's easily Russell Westbrook.   True Bron was the better defender, but Steph was the most valuable player in the Raptor series hands down. The best playoff defensive team had to run a high school defense on the guy, a defense that not even Kobe Bryant, KD, or Bron James himself have even gotten. And he *still* got his. Wayyyy more valuable to the Warriors than Kawhi was to the Raptors. And you can say ""ohhh but Kawhi's defense"", but the Raptors are a better defensive team w/o Kawhi this year than they were last year without him  If you're saying Bron deserved it in 2015, then you have to say Steph deserved it in 2019.  &gt;In the other years like 17 and 18 I don’t think anyone even considered him for it, KD was the easy choice  2017 yes, but in 2018 the vote was split. And I strongly disagreed w the results. The Cavs themselves said their gameplan was to double and trap steph all series... meanwhile, KD got George Hlil on the block *whenever he wanted*. So of course if you're just going by box score, then you're going to think KD was the more valuable player.  But was KD more important than Curry in that series? Hell no. Even the Cavs themselves didn't think so.  &gt;It’s funny you’re so sure I’m wrong and using a weird criteria but I’m going off who *actually* won, so obviously it’s not just me who thinks this, it was the people who actually decide the winner too.  because the media's always right. Congrats, there are plenty of ESPN pundits who think you're right too.  &gt;Saying “but but Curry got 30 points on great efficiency!” Cmon dude there’s not a conspiracy against the first ever unanimous mvp  lol you keep bringing up ""conspiracy"" then attacking me for that point you brought up. I don't think the institutions are designed to put Steph down, i think the systems of voting are flawed and aren't actually based on *who was the more valuable player*. You keep attacking me for all these other points that you're making than I'm not. If you're gonna attack anything, attack my thesis: the systems of voting are flawed and aren't actually based on *who was the more valuable player*"
All-time it's gotta be Russell Westbrook. Y'all don't remember the nephews that used to run around here during his MVP season

1. Steph Curry   2. Magic Johnson  3. Steve Nash  4. Oscar Robertson  5. John Stockton  6. Chris Paul   7. Kyrie Irving  8. Damian Lillard  9. Russell Westbrook  10. Jason Kidd
"Russell Westbrook has always shit on the Spurs when they matched up. Him vs Tony Parker is one of the most lobsided matchups of this decade. Westbrook is bigger, faster, and stronger than Parker and abused him every single time."

"It was Reggie Jackson that he had beef with. Reggie thought he should be the starting point guard instead of Westbrook and the whole team kind of got annoyed with Reggie. Also Patrick Beverly and Joel Embiid haha.  People were saying that the reason that KD left was because he didn't want to play with Russell anymore.  Also, KD's burner said ""KD can't win with those cats"", there wasn't a qualifier of ""me and Russ"" iirc. The people that were saying Westbrook was a terrible teammate were the shock commentators on ESPN, etc. The professional sports talkers and analysts.  Now KD gets upset cause GS fans don't adore him as much as some of their other players. Well of course, he joined the team after the ogs had already won a championship. He jumped onto the wagon, it's hard to say he was the reason they won the next one or two. If he had stayed in OKC he would have all the NBA love that he desires and nobody would be calling him a cupcake. The year he left they were up on GS 3-2 in the WCF, they were pretty close to winning their own championship in OKC; he would have been the alpha of a championship team instead of Steph's beta for a team that won a championship before he came."
"I care very little about basketball, never noted the name Russell Westbrook. Now, he’s my favorite basketball player. He and his beautiful wife are exemplary humans!"
You mean Russell Westbrook Jr?
"Since im a Rockets fan and now i like Russell Westbrook im going to change the narrative and say you are talking about right now, so   Start russ  Bench cp3  Cut Iverson (hes old)  This way both the rockets and ex rockets players get in :D  (ESPN did i do it right?)"
I agree their injuries aren’t comparable and Rose has had it way worse but at the end of the day I think people really romanticise the idea of rose because of what could have been. Which is completely fair but can sometime haze the idea of how good he actually was. Russell Westbrook had one of the greatest seasons in NBA history and I think if you’re comparing their MVP seasons then it’s an easy choice
"Meh youve got Ben Dubose being a complete homer while covering the rockets. Royce young and his shtick of ""I must protect Russell Westbrook and trash everyone else"". The whole group of LeBron journalists that openly root for LeBron.  Local sports journalists being biased is not new and is not a big deal."
"Funny that you say that -  I remember one time when I was a junior in college I met up with my friend who lived somewhat nearby to just chill and smoke weed and play video games. I wasn’t much of a gamer, but I still loved playing whatever every once in a while and I liked hanging out with my bud.  We end up getting incredibly high. We played a lot of SmashBros, and I shit you not my friend was nationally ranked and one of the top in the state (would go to tournaments and shit) and he busted my ass; I got him a few times.   But it eventually devolves as we get too high to the point that we end up on the YouTube app on his PS4 (mine that I sold him, actually) and decide to take turns pulling up sort of ‘hype vids’ that we really wanted to watch/liked to watch whenever we were high on our, as a kind of bonding moment.  My friend makes me watch a SmashBros Highlight real. I did not understand it.  I pull up Russell Westbrook’s top career dunks on YouTube – a ~15 minute long video of Westbrook yamming on dudes.  This is the dunk that I replayed like 4 times to try to explain/showcase to him how the slam dunk is the greatest and most iconic act you can commit in sports, to the point that he almost grabbed the sticks out of my hand to get me to stop replaying it - not bc he was completely annoyed but he had understood the first two times. This and the Detroit dunk are my two favorite dunks.  I haven’t talked to Garrett in a while but I’m gonna check on him tomorrow thanks OP"
"Even as a diehard defender of Russell Westbrook, reading the one about him staying late to miss 100 shots had me dying"
"And when he made them, he made the second round. Losing to the Warriors. A team that went 73-9, and his second best teammate had been injured for months and his other best teammate is just not as good as Russ. Huh.   Ahh yeah, you're gonna blame the year he asked for a trade and the year they traded his whole team against him, while you use that reason as excuse for ""it's okay Paul George didn't do as well""  First Round P.  Paul George hasn't sniffed the second round since 2014. That's 5 years man.  So to score it, AD took a game off a 73-9 team as the best player with no real number 2 option on the floor and PG loses to Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, Lebron James, some of that with Russell Westbrook (the more embarassing ones, at that) and somehow, it's AD who isn't as good?"
"Interesting question  There are a few players that are unquestionably above Iverson right now at the guard spot  Michael Jordan Magic Johnson Kobe Bryant Steph Curry Dwyane Wade  So after those 5 we have guys like James Harden Jerry West Oscar Robertson Isiah Thomas John Stockton Steve Nash Clyde Drexler Jason Kidd Gary Payton Russell Westbrook Chris Paul  And I would say Iverson falls some where in this group, it just comes down to where  Personally I would say  Oscar Robertson Jerry West James Harden Isiah Thomas Are above Iverson, after them it gets a bit harder  So at maximum I would put Iverson at 10, but I’m not sure 100% on that and I’m leaning towards putting Drexler, CP3, and John Stockton above him as well."
Tim Duncan  2003 Kobe   1999 Shaq  2003 Jason Kidd  2005 Steve Nash  1999 Kevin Garnett   2014 Kevin Durant   2014 Russell Westbrook   2014 Lebron James   2008 Chris Paul  2005 Ray Allen  2007 Dirk Nowitski   2007 Amar'e Stoudamire   2007 Carlos Boozer   2007 Deron Williams   2013 Marc Gasol  And on and on
I hate hate hate how basketball Culture is full of stupid hyperbole like this “MJ was an alien who couldn’t be touched by mere mortals” “Russell Westbrook plays harder then anybody” “LeBron is 6’9 280” “Steph is the best teammate ever” “Embiid doesn’t have a killer instinct “  People who say this shit are the Fox News of reddit
"The issue with Westbrook is that a bunch of his accolades don't come as a natural consequence of his game. I don't believe that he is as good as his awards suggest. His MVP for example was mostly narrative and because of it he was selected 1st team over Curry while he wasn't as good as him. For example, what Isiah Thomas did with Detroit should be considered more difficult than Westbrook individual accomplishments.  Russell has his flaws which limit his maximum contribution for the team which LIKELY will always put him below star pointguards that had team success. Russell didn't pass the first round once since 2016 and there is a reason while OKC was broken. For Chris Paul you can say that injuries limit his playoff success but with Westbrook is mostly stubbornes. If he stops shooting the 3's and keep the decent pace with Houston that could change but another problem is that he plays with Harden, another big Ego star. In the end, we get what we deserve."
"Russ might be inefficient but it’s hard to support the argument that he’s an inefficient chucker in the clutch.   [His 2016-2017 alone produced probably a 10-15 minute highlight reel of clutch shots.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/4/11/15261172/russell-westbrook-clutch-highlights-buzzer-beater-mvp ). He was clutch in the playoffs too in other years as well.   The steal and 3 pt attempt vs the Clippers, the game sealing and-1 vs the 67 win Spurs, clutch steals against Memphis (I forgot what year) and then there’s the playmaking in the clutch as well."
Russell Westbrook. I just see him as the villain for some reason
Damn Russell Westbrook gon' hit you with the textbook
"""""*You miss 100% of the classes you don't take.*"" - Russell Westbrook"" - Michael Scott"
Rockets fans defending Russell Westbrook from the haters.    Edit: Also Rockets fans cheering on Westbrook against Patrick Beverly.
"Shooting is one of the few things you can work on with a lower leg injury. Of course injuries will fuck your development, but we should be seeing some semblance of consistency by now. It’s been a decade.  Fun fact for you. Russell Westbrook shoots the same 3pt% for his career as Derrick Rose, despite shooting nearly twice as many shots with a lower % of them being assisted."
Past:  Sasha Vujacic (I thought that he could've been an all-star.)  Present: Russell Westbrook (Still hasn't reached his full potential. Probably needs a sports psychiatrist.)  Future: Andrew Wiggins (If LeBron kept him on the team then he'd probably have next. I hope the Dubs' winning culture can light his fire.)
I don’t think he is that good if Russell Westbrook had a good shot he would probably be top 15 all time cause he would really have it all except IQ
he'd be like russell westbrook but with better outside shooting.
Lol that shit wasn’t rigged we were down 3-1 to Russell Westbrook who couldn’t win a chip with all the GOATs in the world by his side; we just spent way too much energy talking shit and winning 73 meaningless games. Lesson learned.
You may hate the way he plays and you may hate his on court decisions but Russell Westbrook is a great and genuine human being
"I think MDA is going to retire, honestly speaking.  Plus, any offensive minded player will thrive in his system.  But for MDA to be successful, he requires atleast two wing players who defend and also be content with lesser usage and shots.  Players like Raja Bell and Boris Diaw in Phoenix and PJ Tucker and Trevor Ariza in Houston.  While Otto Porter Jr. can play a similar role, his defence is not that good to be called lockdown. And neither Lauri nor LaVine are that kind of defenders either, though they have shown improvements in that end of the floor.  Also, needless to mention, MDA's system relies on point gods like Steve Nash and Chris Paul/Russell Westbrook.  Suffice to say Coby White and Sato won't be enough play that role."
&gt;  We had never seen an athletic point guard like him attacking the rim with no fear  Russell Westbrook was literally drafted in the same year lmao  &gt; Lebron averaged 1 more ppg but 1 less assist per game  On 5% higher TS and having to share the ball with Wade
&gt;I mean the gap in TS% is almost 2%  You might want to check your stats again.  Derrick Rose ts%: 54%  Russell Westbrook ts%: 53%  That isn't significant and it's definitely not more significant than .5 apg or 1STL per have.

"Russell Westbrook, Kobe, and Blake are some of mine"
KD was going up against 3 all nba players with Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka as his best players. It’s crazy they were even up 3-1.
The draft is a crap shoot outside of sure fire #1 picks.  So anyone on here that is taking as if they know shit is full of shit.    If we knew definitively Howell players career with turn out OJ mayo and Michael Beasley wouldn't have gone before Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook.    Jahlil okafor wouldn't have gone above...

That’s definitely the lesson Russell Westbrook took from MJ’s career
"&gt;Russell Westbrook misses the game winning three  Exciting content, OP"
They made it seem like they were trying to fix things with the position locks then all of a sudden there’s bullshit packs where muggsy fucking bogues and Russell Westbrook are put as centers  Like what the fuck
"I mean you don’t have to get 20, yo could get 19 and read up on the rookies if that’s cheaper. You might not even need to play 2K to get to know the players.

Nobody. It’s just Russell Westbrook. He’s so much smarter and better dressed than the rest of the nba. All other players are subservient to his greatness.
I see you're a regular Russell Westbrook too.
"Yep, doing that is impressive, love it when athletes really are focused in academics too.  One of my favorite things about him tbh.  I remember that Royce Young piece on him, he does used to do his bills at the Thunder facility, for all his tough guy stuff on court he seems a really smart, nice, well rounded human.  Can't see it not being legit personally.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15628762/everything-always-wanted-know-russell-westbrook-were-afraid-ask"
"They offered him  a partial academic scholarship but he wanted a basketball one and went to UCLA according to these articles.  https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/242007/russell-westbrook-was-offered-partial-academic-scholarship-by-stanford  https://www.collegeconsensus.com/features/best-educated-nba-players/  So looks like the opposite actually, they were giving him one for academics.  3.9 with good test scores and other things probably helps a good bit."
You gone tell Russell Westbrook he can’t get into the gym lol?
"&gt;There were some extenuating circumstances (playing next to the 2 best shooters ever) that would prevent me personally from calling it a GOAT-tier performance  I'm not sure how KD playing with Steph &amp; Klay is relevant into this conversation, do you think someone like Harrison Barnes (or literary anyone else) would've putting up those kind of numbers KD did on insane 70% TS He's one of the best scorers in NBA history who can shoot everyone. Going by you reasoning, then anyone can easily discredit a rando all-time great's performance due to having a stacked team...   &gt;Its just that LeBron James averaged a 33 point triple double on 63% true shooting over the 2 finals.  Why do you ignore their respective shooting splits?  Kevin Durant: 55.6/47.4/92.7  LeBron James: 55.6/38.7/64.9  And I'm not really sure how doing a triple double makes LeBron ahead of KD. I mean, people generally don't rate Russell Westbrook ahead of KD despite putting up a triple double for 3 straight seasons. Something nobody has done in NBA history."
&gt;Someone give me some good news  James Harden and Russell Westbrook are Rockets
"Did we stop caring about the actual games somewhere along the line? There is value in winning a playoff series. The Blazers got to play in the WCF. Their fans have two playoff series victories worth of memories and one of the coolest shots ever to look back on fondly. So the Thunder have a solid team now and they won some imaginary contest? Portland had a solid team too and they had a star player type the Thunder will hope they can draft with one of their picks. Yet, look where Portland is now.   The games have to matter. OKC hasn’t done anything except have a nice regular season. There’s nothing guaranteeing they make better use of it than the Blazers did with theirs. They also managed to never win a title with 3 MVPs on their team before. They proceeded to lose in the first round with Russell Westbrook and Paul George twice. All this stuff about winning the war because they have assets is cute, but let’s spare ourselves this nonsense about having won the war. It’s not even a sure thing they needed to lose in that fashion or in the first round for this to happen. Kawhi left a Spurs team he went to the WCF with two seasons before. Durant left a WCF team. AD left a team he took to the second round."
Russell Westbrook is one of only 12 players to ever be top 4 in mvp voting 4 straight years. Don’t talk about ball if you don’t know what you’re saying.
"I really wanted the Heat to trade for Russell Westbrook this past summer. I think that would’ve been a great fit, even though I love how well he’s done on the Rockets."
"As Adams mentioned, when Russ was injured, Reggie became the starting PG and leader. They're playing the SAME roles.  So when Russ came back, he sure as hell won't be coming off the bench NOR adjust to the 2 spot. That was at a time when the critics were already talking of ""is Russell Westbrook really an SG?"" because he's relatively bigger in that position and they don't want him dominating the ball away from KD.  The scenario you're saying is both Russ and Reggie playing together in the same backcourt. Back then, the league didn't play as much positionless basketball as they are now and they were grooming Roberson to be a Thabo replacement, a formula that gave them success in the past. It was a philosophy of putting long, athletic, and defensive players who can also rebound while Russ and KD (and some Ibaka) ran the whole offense. The team culture also favored Robes more (he's real close with Adams and covered Russ/KD defensive lapses/ does not need to take the ball away from them, and tbh useless on the bench).  So no, we never heard Reggie say he was willing to play SG in order to start nor they needed him to do that because his best role for the team as a scoring 6th man spark and primary ball handler off the bench."
There's no evidence that Russell Westbrook is a bad person.  There is a ton of evidence that he is terrible to/with the media.
Surprised nobody has mentioned “therefore: Russell Westbrook is still overrated” on the whiteboard at 4:17
Which is why it's not a coincidence that most star point guards are mediocre defenders. The best defensive superstar point guard is probably an engaged Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook ended 4th in the course of NBA MVP. He was the assist leader. He scored like 25 ppg averaging a triple double. Do you seriously think he was the 2nd option?
I didn't say you were a troll. You are a troll and you are doing a very good job! Proud of you!   &gt;Cancer is so cancerous that OKC has a better record than cancer's new team thats better than okc roster  Absolute poetry. It's like alphabet soup became sentient and decided to post all over reddit about how much they hate Russell Westbrook.
"&gt;That's because we didn't know better. We all thought cancer with melo and PG 2 HoFers coming off all star seasons can at least beat a rookie with 0 all stars on his team, yet he got outplayed by him and lost in the 1st round despite having a superteam. He proved how toxic and cancerous he is.  This is like 50% coherent, I think you are saying 'After his first season on the Thunder, PG thought Melo was the ""cancer"", so he signed with the Thunder. He later realized that Westbrook was the actual ""cancer"" on the team.'  That's the best I could do to decipher it. It doesn't make much sense. I'm not 100% sure you know what 'cancer' means, especially in the basketball context. Being a 'cancer' doesn't mean being 'not good' it means that a player doesn't stick to the playbook and refuses to pass and involve other teammates in plays. Russ doesn't do that, like he's been the assists leader in a few different seasons. PG enjoyed playing with him and said so dozens of times, but for dome reason you just plug your ears and repeat yourself.  &gt;Look at dipo, immediately became an all star AND had the SAME record as okc's superteam.  You should read the article I linked, [here it is again](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2017/11/29/victor-oladipo-praises-russell-westbrook-during-career-year-i-learned-so-much-from-him/). Vic learned a lot from playing with Russ, you can even see it in his play style, he became a much higher usage player post his stint with the Thunder.  But look, like I appreciate your dedication to trolling. It's very clear why you hate Russ and why you feel you have to post about him over and over again. At this point in your trolling career though you still need a lot of practice, so keep it up! I'd really work on your rhetorical ability and learning to craft coherent arguments. Then work on pivoting and spinning arguments. You sound pretty young, so if you keep at it I'm sure you'll become an insufferable troll in no time! Good luck!"
"as the otehr guy said, literally Russell Westbrook lmao.  31 years old and athletic as ever.  Or does he not rely on explosiveness and athleticism?"
As far as I know KD hasn't said anything bad about Russell as a teammate and there's an SI article that just came out that says their relationship has repaired faster than people think. KD still calls Westbrook a friend. Russell Westbrook was on Kevin Hart's YouTube show and said him and KD don't hate eachother and they are in a better place. That was a year ago.
"PG requested a trade first year of his contract but he signed a long term deal with the Thunder because of Russ, and we know that because he said so. It didn't work out, the Thunder disappointed two years in a row and the whole joining up with Leonard in LA fell into his lap. I think it's pretty reasonable, Thunder didn't have many ways to improve because of the salary cap. It was a sensible move if the goal is winning a championship. He also specifically said it wasn't because of Russ and he liked playing with him.  Similar thing happened with KD, throughout the years he's spoken very positively of Russ. They played with each other for a really long time. When KD opened up his Free agency he started it out by having dinner with Russ and Collison. If he thought he was a ""cancer"" he wouldn't have started out his free agency by talking to Russ. He ended up going to the warriors because that was his best shot at a championship and he won two of them. He's never cited not playing with Russ as a reason, he even mentioned the opposite, basically saying it felt like it was just him and Russ and that was it. He has mentioned that part of the reason he left the Thunder was they kept getting younger and younger, keeping younger players instead of trading for veterans, and I actually agree with this point.  You are also ignoring all of the accounts that back up Russ as being a good teammate:  [TFerg](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/russell-westbrook-terrance-ferguson-help-practice-slump-story-shooting-practice-midnight-thunder-nba) [Kanter](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2019/08/28/enes-kanter-russell-westbrook-was-best-player-teammate-in-nba/) [Abrines](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2854728-alex-abrines-says-russell-westbrook-supported-him-through-mental-health-issues) [Abrines2](https://oklahoman.com/article/5618589/alex-abrines-still-believes-the-next-one-is-going-in.-so-does-russell-westbrook) [Oladipo](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2017/11/29/victor-oladipo-praises-russell-westbrook-during-career-year-i-learned-so-much-from-him/)  Those are just a few, there are a lot more if you want to search around for them. A lot of the young guys have always said how helpful he is and how he shows his trust in them and that gives them confidence.  And like look, I get it, you don't like Westbrook because you like KD and you feel like you have to trash Russ (like you're literally calling him 'cancerbrick' on other threads) . That's fine, but don't like make up dumb shit and ignore everything else to fit your narrative."
"There are 14 players that have lead the NBA (not ABA or BAA) in scoring more than once that Basketball-Reference classifies as guards.  1. Michael Jordan (11)  2. Kobe Bryant (8)  3. Oscar Robertson (7)  4. George Gervin (7)  5. Allen Iverson (5)  6. Bob Cousy (4)  7. Bill Sharman (4)  8. James Harden (4) &lt;-- counts this year  9. Tiny Archibald (3)  10. Pete Maravich (3)  11. Jerry West (2)  12. Mitch Richmond (2)  13. Dwyane Wade (2)  14. Russell Westbrook (2)  7 other guards each have 1 (Brian, Beard, Shue, Bing, Free, Curry).  It's up to you to decide who was a ""point"" guard and who was a ""shooting"" guard. Obviously all were guards who could score."
Damn Russell Westbrook was in the GOAT conversation that young? /s
"Which is the argument I would make. If you’re starting a team back then, would you pick Wilt or Russell first?  Westbrook has amazing statistical seasons and on paper, why would you not want that? But if you were to build a team, you wouldn’t pick him first. Lebron, Curry, Durant, Giannis all would be easily chosen above him among others.   That trickles down to the GOAT argument. If you weren’t the obvious number one during your time, how can you be number one overall?"
"Also, if people actually watched the 90s Bulls they would realize that the Bulls didn't run iso all that much. This idea that Jordan was out there like post-KD Russell Westbrook and just ran 1-on-1 on half of their possessions is nuts. There were definitely games where Jordan decided 'fuck it' and just did his own thing, but every great player since then has also done the same thing.   Plus, Jordan was much more of an iso player *before* they won all their titles. The whole point of the triangle offense was to involve everyone.  But hey, it's easy for people who never watched those teams to cherry-pick some plays, make a Youtube video, and pretend like they know what they're talking about."
That [solo 4-18 4th quarter](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/20/15370190/russell-westbrook-fourth-quarter-shooting-thunder-vs-rockets-game-2-playoffs) was brutal
westbrook was a three star recruit. Terrible example https://247sports.com/Player/Russell-Westbrook-64862/high-school-113666/
"Bron has a longer peak, makes his teammates better, and has had more playoff success than Wilt (in a far larger league).  You're double-dipping by using points and FG% while ignoring that Russell lead the league in DWS 10 years in a row (11 times total) and would likely have 6-10 DPOY awards, if they existed back then.   But overall you missed my point.  You're looking at the most basic of raw stats, without accounting for defense, style of play, or stat padding (and Wilt is the GOAT stat-padder).   Westbrook wasn't the best example (he's just the best modern stat padder example) so let's use Harden.  36.1, 6.6, and 7.5 is better than any Jordan season, and his 61.6 TS% is better than any of Jordan's seasons as well.   There are probably people out there right now who believe Harden is a better offensive player than Prjme Jordan, because the stats say so"
"Except in the case of prime McGrady or Westbrook there isn't a single stat, individual accomplishment or team accomplishment that even suggests they are in the same universe of Jordan.  Simmons never saw Wilt OR Russell play. He went from accounts and handpicked game tapes to prove his point that Russell was better, when in reality if you look at every stat possible Wilt was hands down BY FAR the best player in the league in his age.  People love to mention Russell's 5 MVPs as proof that he was as good as Wilt (who had 4), but they forget to mention that Wilt was pretty disliked by his peers (who actually voted for MVP) and Russell won MVP THREE TIMES without being All-NBA First Team, which is selected by writers. So, he was the MVP, but wasn't the best center in the league? Interesting, almost as if people gave him the award because he was liked and was in the best team and players can't leave their biases off the table when voting.  Also, just as a side note and not directed at you, if you love LeBron and have him in the GOAT debate you absolutely need to have Wilt, since they are basically the same (ridiculously talented who put up crazy stats, but won far less than people thought they would due to playing great teams)."

"Russ aside, the new BPM formula is far superior to the old one in terms of making it a more useful ""all in one"" stat. It's pretty unquestioned in any analytics circle that Russell Westbrook didn't literally have some outlier caliber Greatest Single Season in NBA history."
"&gt;passing the ball for assists  he did that only a couple times at the end of blowout games once the result was decided. i remember when he did it vs the suns, etc. they were actively trying to keep him from getting a triple double.  show me evidence of him doing that, outside of individual plays in blowout wins that got spread by the media and blown out of proportion  &gt;boxing people out  TIL the 2016-17 Thunder invented the concept of centers boxing out. Russell Westbrook bullied Steven Adams into giving up his hard earned classy rebounds 😢 Before Russ, big men were the only players allowed to go up for rebounds"
"I’m the first to get on the anti-Russell Westbrook bandwagon. I’ll admit, he’s good, but not that good. This is why: 1. He has a lot of turnovers. 2. Makes bad decisions with the ball. 3. Poor shooter. 4. He’s not a leader. 5. Can’t build a team around him- he’s just not good enough.  6. He hogs the ball."
"If the team with the worst record actually got the first pick and picked the best player in the draft, from 1996-2014:  1996: Memphis Grizzlies select: Kobe Bryant  1997: Memphis Grizzlies select: Tim Duncan  1998: Denver Nuggets select: Dirk Nowitzki  1999: Memphis Grizzlies select: Manu Ginobili  2000: Los Angeles Clippers select: Michael Redd/Hedo Turkoglu  2001: Chicago Bulls select: Pau Gasol  2002: Golden State Warriors select: Yao Ming  2003: Cleveland Cavaliers select: LeBron James  2004: Orlando Magic select: Dwight Howard  2005: Atlanta Hawks select: Chris Paul  2006: Portland Trail Blazers select: LaMarcus Aldridge  2007: Memphis Grizzlies select: Kevin Durant  2008: Miami Heat select: Russell Westbrook  2009: Sacramento Kings select: Stephen Curry  2010: Brooklyn Nets select: Paul George  2011: Minnesota Timberwolves select: Kahwi Leonard  2012: Charlotte Hornets select: Anthony Davis  2013: Orlando Magic select: Giannis Antetokounmpo  2014: Milwaukee Bucks select: Joel Embiid   Bonus: No repeat teams.

"He's a beast, that's for sure. Having said that, I'd rather have a dozen average players than one Russell Westbrook. The fact that he's a team's biggest asset is negated by the fact that he's also a team's biggest liability.   Also a choke artist."
"Mehhhh. The great ones don't turn it off.    Russell Westbrook has had plenty of bad injuries too, dude still never turns it off."
"Donovan Mitchell / Rudy Gobert / Jazz in general  Chris Paul Russell Westbrook Patrick Beverly Jamal Murray / Jokic Trae Young Paul Pierce back in the day (I’m ok with the current generation of Boston players though, they  all seem cool)  Chris Bosh / Heatles The Tony Parker/Manu Ginobli era spurs.   On the fence: Lebron James - I cant really wish him to lose since he joined the lakers and I’m a diehard Kobe fan. Gotta root for the lakers"
Fun fact. Here is a list of all 16 players in the NBA that averaged 10 rebounds or more a game.  Russ grabbed barely half as many contested rebounds as 15th place...who himself was well behind everyone else  But go off man. Pretend Russ wasn't taking easy uncontested rebounds.   Player | Contested Rebounds per game ------|--------------------------- Andre Drummond | 7.6 Clint Capela | 5.6 Anthony Davis | 5.5 Hassan Whiteside | 5.5 KAT | 5.3 Joel Embiid | 5.2 Nikola Vucevic | 5.2 Rudy Gobert | 5.0 Nikola Jokic | 5.0 Tristan Thompson | 4.9 Deandre Jordan | 4.7 Jusuf Nurkic | 4.7 Deandre Ayton | 4.5 Giannis | 4.2 Kevin Love | 3.4 Russell Westbrook    | **1.8**
And I'm talking about the thunder team after KD left.. in which Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double and made it to the playoffs.. obviously less efficient (and stat padded on boards) but on that same level of awe if we are reasonably comparing era's.
If we're ignoring the style of play only when it benefits Jordan than sure. But if you take Jordan in his first 6 years and put him in this league today. He'd be Russell westbrook of we adjusted for style of play.
Russell Westbrook is basically Ray Allen compared to Simmons as far as shooting is concerned
russell westbrook and bricking 3s
"Russell Westbrook, Dwyane Wade, LeBron, Tim Duncan, Shaq  Maybe not the perfect lineup, just thinking of guys who's game would be drastically improved by the situation especially in today's NBA. 3 of the best mid range/slashers with 2 of the greatest bigs of all time.   Guys like DeMar DeRozan and Ben Simmons would also see huge leaps in today's NBA"
 Russell Westbrook would eat Oscar’s lunch and make Oscar apologize for it on the court. There is no comparison.
"I fucking love Russell Westbrook, through all the hate this guy is still one of the most unstoppable players in the league and doesn’t give a shit what any one thinks. I cannot wait until he finally gets his ring."
"For me it would be Embiid, but greats like Charles Barkley, Shaq, McHale and others always call out Embiid for not trying hard enough every night and not having good leadership. Embiid is also injury prone.   I might be the biggest Ben Simmons hater on Earth. Just don't really understand how you can like a guy who doesn't want to improve or evolve his game by developing a jumpshot. He is a more well rounded version of DeMar DeRozan, but even DeRozan is a much better scorer both of which don't shoot 3s and therefore struggle in today's NBA.   Not shooting 3s I can understand, even guys like LeBron and  Russell westbrook and plays like that from time to time. But Simmons doesn't even have a mid-range game is mostly a slasher, and in today's NBA that doesn't work. For someone as ball dominant as him its much easier to defend him given such a glaring weakness to his game.   I seriously doubt the Sixers would improve choosing to build around Simmons rather than Embiid."
So you're saying that you can't build around Russell Westbrook?
"Russell Westbrook is not a winner, he's a stat chaser. That's why no one gives a shit"
"I’m gonna get hated on and that’s fine, but my honest opinion is Russell Westbrook is a great player but he needs to understand his role on the team and not try to take over the game too much when he’s not that all around player that can rescue the game, and often times he puts his team into these tough positions with his own reckless actions. The reason I don’t give a shit is because triple doubles are not conducive to winning and also he likes to steal his teammates rebounds (Melo even admitted this). He averaged his triple doubles at the expense of his overall team success and would force multiple passes just to get the assist (which is apparent in his &lt;4 TOV/gm the last 4 seasons."
Non bigs: 1. Ben Simmons 2. Russell Westbrook 3. Andre Roberson 4. MKG 5. Fultz
"HANDS DOWN, my favorite NBA player and its not even close.   Grew up a die hard Michael Jordan fan at 5 years old- I had a shaved head, full black Jordan Bulls uniform, Air Jordan Retro 13s and the wrist band. Loved MJ because of how dominant he was.   Everyone points out LeBron but, mannnn I get huge MJ vibes when I watch Russell Westbrook play. He is only 6'3' but jumps out of the gym and is one of the most athletic players of all time. He plays with that nasty tenacity like MJ did (even KD got tired of it) Russ is like get out of my way I'm gonna win us this game.   His MVP season had a handful of miraculous clutch shots by the Brodie too even though a lot of people call him Westbrick for not being a consistent shooter.   MJ himself has said ""I see a lot of myself in Westbrook"".   Those triple double seasons were epic even though they never made playoff runs."
Hmm that’s an interesting theory. I think the struggle between the team and the individual has always been apart of basketball since the beginning. Some of the greats in the past have been perceived as selfish because their individual accolades didn’t necessarily result in team success from Wilt to Pistol Pete to MJ before he won his titles to Allen Iverson and Russell Westbrook today.  You might be onto something with the player empowerment idea. I think the shorter contracts that the superstars sign nowadays might make it difficult for teams to develop the chemistry necessary for an intricate read and react type system like the triangle. I think the shorter contracts along with rule changes that encourage more 3 point shooting might have led to more teams adopting spread pick and roll systems which simplified the game for teams that haven’t been together that long.
"As great of numbers that Russ has on paper, there are a lot of factors that the stats do not show.  The bottom line is Russell Westbrook does not win. He is a selfish player and has always wanted to be THE GUY. Even when KD was with him he always wanted to be the guy who took the last shot. Great players realize their strengths and weaknesses. Unfortunately, Russell does not realize and tries to overcompensate.   Russell might be the best athletic talent in the NBA but I don’t think he has the basketball IQ of other NBA greats which is why he isn’t talked about more."
Russell Westbrook cannot run faster than Steven Adams can pass a basketball.
"Russell Westbrook will never win a title. So in the end, he'll be a foot note. Personally, I would never take a guy who wears number zero. Whatever personality trait which motivates them to take it, seems to translate to a team detriment."
"Russel Westbrook is able to achieve this useless stat line by tanking his team. To put it bluntly he is a selfish player who isn’t worth spit. Look at his +/- ,  2015-16 : 7.9   2016-17: 3.1   2017-18: 4.8  2018-19: 4.0   2019-20: 2.7  He isn’t even the best point guard on his team! Russell Westbrook is cancer to any organization, that being said I’m glad he’s back with harden."
"Also never got out of the first round of the playoffs in any of those years and hasn’t gotten out of the first round since KD left. Nobody cares what you do in the regular season. If he was getting to the western conference finals or the finals with these numbers, they would hold a lot more weight. But he couldn’t make it out of the first round so no one is going to take it that serious. Billy Donovan also told the team to let Russ get rebounds so he could start the fast break faster. The game plan was designed for him to have a triple double. As far as his assists go, Russell Westbrook doesn’t make his teammates better. He’s not like a Steve Nash, Chris Paul in his prime, John Stockton. Assist men that are setting their teammates up for assists and very easy plays. Russ does not do that. He’s very selfish for someone with such high assist numbers because his assists in my opinion are “bailout” assists most of the time. It’s not like he’s putting his teammates in great positions, they’re just making the most of the situation. He’s also extremely inefficient. Takes wild 3 pointers when he’s never been a good shooter. I could go on and on all day about how overrated his triple double seasons are but unfortunately I don’t have any more time to elaborate"
"Russell Westbrook is objectively a better player than Oscar Robertson due to the advancements in the game made by the players who came before him, one of whom was Oscar Robertson."

the disrespect to russell westbrook is unreal. this is what he does best.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0q1Tbq4qLk  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0q1Tbq4qLk
"""The way Russell Westbrook is perceived is how Jordan would be perceived if he never won a championship."" _________________________________________________ This is false though, because Jordan wasn't perceived as an inefficient scorer.  He was league MVP really early in his career.  Saying Jordan would be perceived like Russ ignores that the reason Russ is perceived the way he is is partly because of his massive shooting inefficiency.  In Jordans prime, no one was saying he was taking ""bad or I'll advised shots"".  He was literally making more than half his shots for most of his career.  Russ has never been perceived to be that level of automatic on offense.  If a guy came around and was scoring at 52% percent, which is what Jordan was doing during his prime, people would call him great.  Triple doubles are great, but the efficiency takes it all a notch down, cause it makes it clear he's gunning just to get the numbers."
Name a more iconic duo than Russell Westbrook and chasing individual stats with zero interest in the outcome of the game.
It was the only game plan because we had a skeleton crew for a team that was built around Kevin Durant and not Russell Westbrook. The fact that the team was still able to be competitive is a testament to Russ’ ability as a player.
Russell Westbrook would never have been invited or offered a contract to a thing like this out of high school.
 this sub hates Russell Westbrook. no other player outside of maybe LeBron would get hate for underperforming in a playoff series while being noticeably injured. people hate this guy for the pettiest reasons lmao
Those numbers are flashy but ultimately there has been quite a few active players who have had better seasons than any Russell Westbrook season sans maybe 2016-17.
"Two truths:  1) Russell Westbrook is awesome, is/was a top-10 player in the league for a long time, one of the most athletic players of all time. Gets too much shit for not playing ""winning basketball"" when he's been a top-5 PG in the league for many years during one of, if not THEE best point guard era of all time.  2) Triple-doubles are the most meaningless metric in not just basketball, but perhaps all of sports. Westbrook should be celebrated for his talent as a basketball player, not for this 100% arbitrary statistic that means nothing towards what's important: winning basketball games."
"because it's the first one that shows up when you search for it. here:  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=russell+westbrook+stat+padding+compilation  there's plenty of other games, compilations, and videos to choose from on there. keep sticking your head in the sand tho."
"   &gt;The  Thunder also aren’t as blatant about giving Westbook rebounds as  they’re made out to be. Yes, it’s conspicuous that Westbrook is pulling  in 8.5 uncontested rebounds per game, up from 5.9 a season ago. But we  can track how often teammates give up a rebound so that a nearby  teammate can pick up the ball: It’s a stat called deferred rebound  chances. This season, the number of the Thunder’s deferred chances has  decreased to 16.8 per game from a league-high 17.7 a season ago. What’s  changed? Well, the 6.6 uncontested rebounds per game Kevin Durant  collected in 2015-16 needed to be redistributed somewhere.   &gt;   &gt;Unlike  shooting or passing, rebounding suffers from severe diminishing  returns. There are only so many rebound opportunities, and only so many  bodies needed to corral them. Oklahoma City finished first in overall  rebound rate, and third in defensive rebound rate. The Thunder have  decided to use this surplus of rebounding to leak extra bodies out into  the break, knowing their point guard can collect the rebound and start  the break. In other words, the Thunder have made a conscious effort to  let Westbrook get the rebounds because they think it helps them win, not  just because they wanted Westbrook to hoard triple-doubles. The Thunder  are fifth in percent of points scored via transition, so it’s working  out for them  [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/)  &amp;#x200B;  Also did you watch Oscars 1961-62 season?  How exactly do we know if anyone let him get rebounds or not?"
Russell Westbrook is perceived as an explosive athlete and great scorer that ultimately cannot get be the best player on a championship team.  This is EXACTLY how Jordan was perceived before winning a championship.
"Honestly man, not trying to be divisive here but you're just flat out wrong.   Russell Westbrook is *not* an efficient shooter. No number backs that up.  Him shooting more shots at very similar averages is *not* a good thing.  Sample size *tells* you that if you're just an okay shooter at 19 shots per game you're still going to be just an okay shooter at 23 shots per game. Maintaining this non-ideal shooting across more shots is *not* a good thing.   Westbrooks best year from 2% came in the year he took the most 2 pt attempts in his career. His best year from 3 came in the year he almost doubled his next highest 3 pt attempt year. His 3rd best year from 2 came in his 3rd highest output in 2 or attempts. His worst year from 3 came in the year he took his fewest 3 pt attempts. His 2nd best year from 3 came in the year he took his 3rd highest amount of attempts.  Across like 800 games of basketball there's practically no correlation to taking fewer shots and having a higher percentage from 17 to 24 shots per game.   Edit: the argument isn't that Westbrook should go to 10 shots per game and bring all the role players up to 10 shots per game. The argument is that there is nothing uniquely special about a guy taking 20+ shots per game on ~45/~30 splits and, in fact,  plenty do it better."
"I just think majority of the people who dismiss it probably is thinking.  You replace Russell Westbrook on that team with any of the other elites.  Kawhi, Steph Curry, KD, Lebron ect you are going to have a more competitive ball club.  Also at the same time those guys will also be putting up ridiculous numbers as well.  I'm not saying Russell Westbrook is bad i mean in my eyes he is probably a top 15 PG of all time unless you start counting like LBJ or Giannis and all those odd players into the mix.     Edit: I put him top 15 cause i was able to name 10 players i felt better than him pretty easily lol."
"Russell Westbrook never cracked 40% shooting in the playoffs during those 3 seasons... Overrated as fuck.  He was prime Rajon Rondo if you gave him 24 shots per game, cranked up his usage to 40, and took away some of his passing ability."
"Russell Westbrook is one of the most, if not the most under appreciated players of this generation."
"So part of what Westbrook does with the defensive rebounds is start fast breaks. OKC didn't have 3pt shooters and they still doubled their fast break points with westbrook there vs CP3. Houston wants to shoot open 3's and that is easy to do with fastbreaks. [D'Antoni wants Westbrook to rebound and start fast breaks](https://www.si.com/nba/rockets/features/rockets-stress-increased-pace-with-russell-westbrook)  Fast Break Points Per Game  **OKC**  * 2017 - 15.1 - Ranked 3rd - WB led Offense  * 2018 - 18.0 - Ranked 5th - WB led Offense * 2019 - 9.3 - Ranked 30th - CP3 Led Offense   **HOU**  * 2017 - 11.2 - Ranked 17th - CP3 Led Offense  * 2018 - 12.0 - Ranked 19th - CP3 Led Offense  * 2019 - 14.7 - Ranked 8th - WB led Offense  Wesbrook was also out for 11 games this year for HOU.  Saying that they are empty stats/superficial is, in my opinion, incorrect. There is a reason why Adams would clear out people for Westbrook. It is part of controlling the pace of the game with pushing the ball up the court / playing at your tempo and throwing opponents off, and much more.   Edit: I am not trying to argue which player is more efficient, which offensive scheme is better, but just want to point out that the teams are now running a lot differently, and that is on purpose."
"I agree with Mark Cuban's definition that a superstar should be able to carry a team of nobodies to 50 wins.  You know who couldn't do that?  Russell Westbrook.  This despite the fact his final year in OKC he arguably wasn't even the best player on that team.  Paul George was.   Plus they had other quality players around them like Steven Adams.  For context, when Michael Jordan first retired in 94, Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant had no trouble winning 55 games without him.   Westbrook couldn't even crack 50.     Give literally any top-tier guard 24 shots per night, a historically high usage of 40+, and a system where the bigs box out allowing the guard to grab rebounds, you'll be seeing the triple doubles in no time.  Westbrook shot 42% from the field and lead the league in turnovers (5+) during this run.    A fun player for sure, but not a superstar."
"I personally loved that Russ season although I don't know that I'd agree about the supporting cast. I'm looking at it and it's honestly a pretty interesting question. Looking at their preseason predictions according to basketball reference the Thunder were actually predicted to win 45 games to the Rockets' 44 so that is probably indicative so one could probably argue it, but to be honest I think it was just a lot more about the fit. Houston I think was definitely built a lot more around Harden's playstyle, and while they definitely weren't as good defensively they were filled with good shooters and lob threats light Capela and Nene. On the other hand I think the Thunder weren't really built well for Westbrook at all even though there were solid talented players. Roberson for example, he's a fantastic defender but having multiple players who can't shoot on the court with Russell doesn't work with his drive and kick playstyle and in OKC teams just realized this and started to collapse on him. I think that if they were to switch teams Westbrooks stats and wins would have imo been much better albeit he probably wouldn't have a triple double average with the rebounds do to rebounds with Houston's pace.(just like he doesn't average one in houston today). IMO if you switched Russ and Harden in 2017, instead of  - 31.6 ppg 10.4 apg 10.7 rpg  I think he averages something like 33.0 ppg 11.5 apg 8.0 rpg but then again this is all just for fun arguments sake so I'd like to hear what others think."
Bruh these posts about Russell Westbrook pop up like once or twice every few months and that's quite a lot of attention tbh. What more do you want?
The way Russell Westbrook is perceived is how Jordan would be perceived if he never won a championship.
"&gt;The Thunder also aren’t as blatant about giving Westbook rebounds as they’re made out to be. Yes, it’s conspicuous that Westbrook is pulling in 8.5 uncontested rebounds per game, up from 5.9 a season ago. But we can track how often teammates give up a rebound so that a nearby teammate can pick up the ball: It’s a stat called deferred rebound chances. This season, the number of the Thunder’s deferred chances has decreased to 16.8 per game from a league-high 17.7 a season ago. What’s changed? Well, the 6.6 uncontested rebounds per game Kevin Durant collected in 2015-16 needed to be redistributed somewhere.  &gt;Unlike shooting or passing, rebounding suffers from severe diminishing returns. There are only so many rebound opportunities, and only so many bodies needed to corral them. Oklahoma City finished first in overall rebound rate, and third in defensive rebound rate. The Thunder have decided to use this surplus of rebounding to leak extra bodies out into the break, knowing their point guard can collect the rebound and start the break. In other words, the Thunder have made a conscious effort to let Westbrook get the rebounds because they think it helps them win, not just because they wanted Westbrook to hoard triple-doubles. The Thunder are fifth in percent of points scored via transition, so it’s working out for them  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/"
i was scrolling for too long to finally see someone with a brain. Russell Westbrook doesnt play winning basketball
"Note:  Durant did the same thing, this was OKC's strategy for years before this.  See 2016:  https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=REB&amp;dir=1  Also, OKC's offensive rating went up significantly after a Westbrook rebound.  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  &gt;Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  &gt;That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  &gt;After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years."
"Who cares. Kobe, Shaq have just one mvp, in  the end rings&gt;mvp. Beside Lebron who from still playing players are actually better? Curry? Maybe. Kd with mvp and one ring while playing for Gsw not looking great. Harden with Westbrook can have all triple double but zero rings.   Same for Giannis, no matter if he best player if you dont have rings you going from top players like Jordan, Hakeem Kobe, Duncan, Bird, Wilt, Russell to Malone, Barklay, Ewing, Drexler."
"Bro guys who create at a high level out of the PnR(I.e. make impeccable passing reads) are all expensive. Russell, Kemba, Van Vleet, Dinwiddie: all of them cost something. Devonte is going to command at least 4/51(around the max we can extend him for this offseason) but if he hits 2021 FA he’s not gonna be a Hornet long term, he’s going to command too much money.  You can get 75% of Klay on offence from Duncan Robinson, or Matt Thomas, or in this years draft Isaiah Joe. Guys who can shoot off movement with high basketball IQ are not really that rare IMO.   On defence Klay is harder to replace to be fair.  But like offensively who is similar to Draymond in their ability to grab a rebound and run a fast break putting actual pressure on the basket? DeAaron Fox, Lebron James, prime Rondo, Westbrook, Malik Monk, and...very rarely do you get a PF with Draymond’s north south speed and passing. Like legit Draymond is prob the best passer of any 4/5 in the league, and with that he’s also a way better ballhandler and way faster than a Marc Gasol/Al Horford or even Deni Avdija in the draft. Guys who can run the break and play the 4/5 are super rare=&gt; Kings struggling there too.   If you’re factoring in defence with the ability to run the break off a rebound... apart from Lebron James, who else can do what Draymond does to like 75% of his level. MKG probably does about 60% of what Draymond does overall, and that difference is why Draymond is a starter and MKG(who should be a starter) isn’t used much. Guys who can run the break well are all very good basketball players, but when you factor in defensive impact and basketball IQ in half court settings Draymond is unmatched.  Basically to replace Klay: you could cover 75% of Klay’s offence right now, with like 5M investment, and shifting a few pieces. They can still win a ring, they’d literally run the exact same schemes with Duncan Robinson or Matt Thomas or Isaiah Joe instead of Klay. If you replace Draymond with MKG they’re not close to the same."
My two favorite players are Russell Westbrook and Damian Lillard. It's been a weird couple of years.
"Wilt Chamberlain, Young Shaq and Russell Westbrook are in that elite group but I think LeBron stands out because he's been athletic for so long without sustaining any real injury due to wear and tear. Most cases were freak accidents on his arm somewhere."
Russell Westbrook
So did I :(  I really thought he would be the next Russell Westbrook. He had good raw stats rookie year
"Ah that definitely wasn't my intention. There's a reason that more than half of most people's top 10 all time lists are centres (Kareem, Wilt, Russell, Shaq, Duncan, sometimes Hakeem). What I meant to imply was that it was easier to artificially create spacing for a single player in the 90s because the rules that a defence had to follow were much more strict, and very punishing. If Jordan wants an iso or PnR at the top of the key, send Pippen to the strong side corner and the other three to the weak side, often inside the 3pt line. Here's a quote from a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/12/sports/pro-basketball-nba-s-illegal-defense-rule-will-most-likely-be-eliminated.html) from 2001 regarding the defence rule changes:  &gt;""The changes are meant to encourage more movement and passing, while discouraging teams from steering offenses toward isolation plays, in which a majority of a team's players stand idle on the weakside to draw defenders away from the ball. That trend has been a factor in the decrease in scoring over the past decade.""  Today, if Giannis is at the top of the key you'll have a centre along the baseline ready to receive a skip pass, your stongest wing on the strong side close to Giannis ready to pick-and-roll or pick-and-pop, and your two remaining players on the weak side standing outside the 3-pt line for kick-out opportunities. The space is created for those players because the dominant forces that rule the league today (Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi, Harden, Westbrook, KD, etc) cause defences to collapse in and provide help, and inevitably leaving one of the four players I mentioned open. This requires your stars to not only be dominant forces, but also great passers to be able to figure out passing lanes as the defence collapses. This is why players like LeBron, Giannis, and Harden are seen as some of the best players today - they can both cause defenses to collapse **and** pass out of those situations. This is what makes perimeter play easier today, and why the 3pt shot is much more viable than it was in previous decades - those players are less defended than they've ever been. It also sets a premium on wing defence, and it's why the media (and front offices) salivate over great wing defenders.  So Jordan had to best one defender who can put his hands on his waist, while Giannis has to best a line of two-three defenders. I'm not saying one is harder, just that they're different and present different problems to an offence."
I think the reason Knicks fans think he’s a primary handler is because he’s still super young. No one thought Russell Westbrook was a primary ball handler at the same age. The problem is the Knicks want to rush into being a playoff team rather than taking more time to develop him into the type of player that is a primary handler.
They are too easy to manipulate. See Russell Westbrook.
"Because of the fact there has never been a prime d rose, I would have to go with Russell Westbrook"
"If you want to support a team with young talent lead by a dynamic rookie and future superstar you can pick either the Grizzlies or the Pelicans. Out of those two teams, if you prefer the grace, agility and absurd athleticism of Ja Morant (accompanied by triple J’s killer 3 point shooting and the all around fundamentals of Ja’s college teammate Brandon Clarke), pick the Grizzlies. If you prefer the raw power, strength and also absurd athleticism of Zion Williamson (accompanied by Lonzo Ball’s flashy playmaking, Brandon Ingram’s all round scoring ability and wholesome family man and elite defensive veteran Jrue Holiday) pick the Pelicans  If neither of those suit you. You can pick a team lead by a dynamic young sophomore who is already a superstar you can either pick the Dallas Mavericks and the already elite playmaking of Luka Doncic (with some skilled but inefficient 3 point shooting to booth) accompanied by his fellow Eurostar Kristaps Porzingis or the Atlanta Hawks and Trae Young with his elite 3 point shooting and creative handles (with a host of other rookies and sophomores as a bonus)  If you want to support the big boys, pick the Lakers, if you want to support the big boys but hate Lebron James, pick the Bucks and last year’s (and likely this year’s) MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo. If you want to support the big boys and be a hipster about it, pick the Clippers. If you want to support the big boys but want to take a break from being the big boys for a year, pick the Warriors and Steph Curry. If you want to pick the big boys and have the tolerance to put up with Drake, pick the Raptors and Spicy P. If you want to support the big boys and feel inevitable disappointment, pick James Harden, Russell Westbrook and the Houston Rockets. If you want to support next year’s big boys, pick the Celtics for Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker or the Brooklyn Nets with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant (don’t trust them to be good leaders though)  If you want to pretend you’re a contending team you can choose the Utah Jazz, with completely destroyed team chemisu, high flying dunker Donovan Mitchell, 2 time DPOY going on 3 Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley who swears he was good last year. Or you can choose the Denver Nuggets with Nikola Jokic, who has previously starred in Ghostbusters as the Stay Puft monster. Or you could choose the 76ers, a team that could have been legit contenders but royally screwed it up  If you want a team that might be contenders in a few years, you can pick the Thunder, currently lead by veteran all time great point guard Chris Paul, have a promising young Combo guard in Shai Gilgeous Alexander and an unholy amount of future draft picks. Alternatively you can pick the Orlando Magic, with an all star center and talented young defenders or the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler who is basically Michael Jordan with less talent and more anger  If you want to follow a team that can’t really get better or worse, pick either the San Antonio Spurs, the Portland Trail Blazers, the Washington Wizards or the Detroit Pistons  If you want to play the very long game for supporting a team that might have a decent future, you can choose between, the Timberwolves, the Kings or the Bulls  If you want to be constantly depressed follow the Hornets or the Knicks"
"DeMar Derozan's probably the best guy LeBron has directly denied. Russell Westbrook too, but he only went against him once."
My list  1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Steph Curry  4) James Harden  5) Chris Paul  6) Kawhi Leonard  7) Russell Westbrook  8) Kyle Lowry  9) Marc Gasol  10) Blake Griffin  11) Anthony Davis  12) Damian Lillard  13) Dirk Nowitzki  14) Al Horford  15) Dwyane Wade  16) LaMarcus Aldridge  17) Paul George  18) Kyrie Irving  19) Kevin Love  20) Mike Conley
"Spacing and Defensive positionless small-ball:  Russell Westbrook, Gary Payton, and Klay Thompson as an extended backcourt. (8$)  Scottie Pippen as the centerpiece of our defense, although everyone on this list can defend very well. (5$)  Dave Cowens, Undersized center who could wrestle with Kareem at his prime. At 6'9 I'm not worrying about him clogging up the paint. (2$)  Ideally, Russell would drive on every possession while Dave Cowens (midrange god) stood outside the paint, drawing the center away from the paint and robbing them of their rim protection. Gary and Klay would wait in the corners for a kickout, and Scottie would be positioned at a wing.   If Russ gets disrespected at the 3 point line, he can pull up as well (In his MVP season Russ made 200 threes on 34% efficiency. He'll punish if you leave him open.)"
"&gt; Theis sets these sort of an illegal screen going to the basket  It's called ""sealing"", most teams do it in some capacity.   Yes, Theis is good at it. No, Theis isn't the reason Tatum has thrived this year.  [Here's a video of other teams doing it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aOsMkmo6sM) The video features:  * John Wall / Marcin Gortat * Russell Westbrook / Steven Adams * Kyrie Irving / Tristan Thompson   It's also no more of an advantage than the [moving screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX8MY2cjlPY) GSW became famous for. You wouldn't say Bogut is the reason Steph Curry became deadly out on the perimeter.    Illegal screens are an incredibly common part of the modern NBA.  &gt;The reason Tatum has improved his ability to finish around the rim is because Theis sets these sort of an illegal screen going to the basket which takes out the rim protector and/or help defense.   This doesn't make sense at all because we were doing it last season as well. Baynes is also really good at opening pathways to the rim.   The reason Theis is getting noticed for it now is because it's an improvement in his game, whereas Baynes was always a bit of a box-out/screen/seal specialist.  &gt; When Theis isn't on the floor Tatum's finishing ability around the rim decreases by quite a bit.   Tatum's true shooting is completely unchanged with or without Theis.     -| TS% ---|--- Theis ON| 56.2 Theis OFF | 56.2"
"&gt; And do you realize that the fact Durant and Curry play on the same team along Klay creates space for all of them and opens up the floor because no opponent can leave their man open to help off ball.  It also makes that there are less shots for both when they are on the floor together.  Stats don't tell the whole story, because if it did Russell Westbrook was better than Kevin Durant in 2017 as he averaged more points, rebounds, assists and steals.  LeBron has been a lot of things in his run, but he was almost never the best playoff scorer. KD at age 22 averaged 30 ppg on 60% TS against the Heatles in the NBA Finals.  KD is hands down the best playoff SCORER of this decade, while LeBron due to all the things he does was the best PLAYER. KD has scored the same as LeBron in this decade while playing FAR better competition in the playoffs due to being in the West and not getting to play teams like the Hawks, Pistons and Charlotte."
"Just find whatever stats support whatever argument you want to make.  No but seriously, they all have their place and they all have flaws, the most important thing is to know how the stats are made, so that you can understand how if the numbers are useful in what you’re trying to find out.  Even these advanced metrics are often based on counting stats, and so they can be fooled. Russell Westbrook at one point had the highest season BPM and VORP of all time but had terrible efficiency and his team wasn’t very good."
Zara would beat up Russell Westbrook. Someone needs to watch that video of that kid getting his ass slammed onto the ground by the other dude that has 30 lbs on him.
Nate is a lot more explosive... This is like saying zaza would beat up Russell westbrook
Low hanging fruit:   Isaiah Thomas and MJ  KG and Big Baby   Shaq and Kobe   Lebron James and Lance Stephenson   Lebron James and JR Smith  Russell Westbrook and KD
That was an extremely reasonable take for a guy named Russell-Westbrook-fan.  Was not expecting that.   Personally I think he’s probably 8-9.
He’s way higher than people give him credit for. It’s important to remember very few good PGs have led their team to a ring as the main option so rings aren’t as essential to the conversation as they would be for another position.   1. Magic Johnson   2. Oscar Robertson   3. Stephen Curry   4. Isiah Thomas   5. Jason Kidd  6. Russell Westbrook   7. Chris Paul  8. Bob Cousy   9. Steve Nash  10. John Stockton
"Seems like there's been a lot of hostility between Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook, especially after last year's playoff series. Tbf Westbrook always seems hostile towards a lot of players"
"LeBron has faced 21 MVPs in the playoffs (I'm using former MVPs and near MVPs, so in this scenario 2012 Westbrook counts even though he won MVP in 2017):   2007: Tim Duncan  2008: Kevin Garnett  2010: Derrick Rose, Kevin Garnett  2011: Kevin Garnett, Derrick Rose, Dirk Nowitzki  2012: Kevin Garnett, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden  2013: Tim Duncan  2014: Kevin Garnett (Shell of himself), Tim Duncan   2015: Derrick Rose (Shell of Himself), Steph Curry  2016: Steph Curry  2017: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant  2018: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant     13/21 came in the finals. For reference, Dirk played against Karl Malone, Tim Duncan x6, Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash x2, Shaq, Kobe, Kevin Durant x3, Russell Westbrook x3, James Harden, LeBron James, James Harden. (This doesn't include Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade or other arguable MVPs).   Dirk has faced 21 MVPs. LeBron's facing 10 former MVPs in the finals isn't that impressive, it just shows that more often than not the MVP was in the Western conference because the West was so much harder."
"Yeah but, it reduces the offense to a two-man, playmaker-driven game. It's basic to defend on paper, but when you're actually being asked to contain a Russell Westbrook or a Ja Morant, shit gets more complicated.  Obviously it's harder to defend squads that swing the ball around on the perimeter and stretch you all the way out, but you also can't reasonably give a majority of the credit for the success of such a system to one player."
"Russell Westbrook has almost literally stopped taking bad 3s, in fact he has less than 2 ‘3 point field goal attempts per game’ since he settled in the Rockets system. The so described ‘difficult’ relationship between Harden and CP3 lead them to a game 7 against a top 2 team of all time with one of the two missing the last two games of that series, so I personally don’t believe that personal relationships between two players have that much of an impact at that level, if anything the most important thing is the functionality of a player in a system and as far as i’m concerned, Westbrook fits perfectly in a 5-out scenario like Houston. To end, I don’t know if they can get to the finals or win a championship because of the presence of other great teams in the league (not necessarily because Westbrook is buddies with Harden or not) but they do have a chance in my opinion."
My first thought can’t make a post with a name like Russell Westbrook fan and expect anything different
"Chris Paul has a serious case as well.  In the decade:  7x All-Star, 6x All-NBA (3x First Team), 7x All-Defensive (6x First Team)  17th in points, 2nd in assists, 1st in steals  There's also Russell Westbrook.   MVP, 8x All-Star, 8x All-NBA (2x First Team), 2x scoring leader  4th in points, 17th in rebounds, 1st in assists, 2nd in steals."

Fun fact if we only counted his years on the Rockets, he'd be averaging 29.0 PPG, only behind the career averages of Jordan &amp; Wilt.

name three point guards better than russell westbrook
Thinking Russell Westbrook isn’t a top three point guard.
Thinking Russell Westbrook is a top three point guard.
"I feel like peak steroid Wilt Chamberlain has this wrapped up. If the legends are true.  As for this moment, it seems like players attest to it being Steven Adams. I think Zion Williamson will succeed him. Pound for pound, I bet it's Russell Westbrook or Eric Bledsoe."
"TOP 10 (missed triple-doubles by 1pt, reb, stl, as, blck)  Oscar Robertson - 71  Magic Johnson - 64  Jason Kidd - 57  Larry Bird - 56  LeBron James - 52  Russell Westbrook - 39  Wilt Chamberlain - 29  Kevin Garnett - 29  Scottie Pippen - 26  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - 25"
"I think old players get shit on a lot, but like Bill Russel won 11 titles in an era where there were only 6-8 teams in the entire league and the playoffs consisted of 2 rounds. The whole rings/GOAT argument should be post merger. The pre merger era is just so fucking different.  EDIT: Could you imagine if the 2020 Milwaukee Bucks played in a league with only 7 other teams. To make it more reflective of the late 50s early 60s we will have 5 of those 7 teams be teams without a generational superstar, so let's say the Sacramento Kings, Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic, Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons. All of the teams from this era had no name players and there were very few stars outside of the Celtics and a few stars scattered around the league, often times the only star on their team. So in addition to the 5 mediocre teams, then you have one team with a great player (Bob Pettit) but the rest of the team is meh, let's say this is the equivalent to the Portland Trail Blazers with Dame Lillard. And then you have one other team with a true GOAT MVP candidate on their team (Wilt Chamberlain), let's say this scenario it's James Harden and the Houston Rockets, but James Harden and the Rockets without Russell Westbrook, because Wilt didn't have a consensus top 10-15 player on his team during Boston's dominance.   It's not that unfathomable to imagine Giannis and the Milwaukee Bucks dominating against these teams night in and night out and cruising through the playoffs every year to 11 titles. In this universe though the Celtics were even better, because they had Sam Jones, John Havlicek and Bob Cousy who were considered top 10 players of the era. So this would be like Giannis, Trae Young, Luka Dončić and Domas Sabonis beating up on the Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns, Charlotte Hornets and Pistons for a decade with their only competition being a Dame led Blazers squad and a Harden led Rockets team with no Westbrook."

"&gt; A modern day comparison is saying Russell Westbrook is better than Steph Curry a couple years ago because Russell put up a triple double all season.  That’s not even the same because Westbrook had a lot of ugly numbers underneath the basic stats pts reb ast. Curry was massively efficient. Maybe, an argument can be made that Westbrook was better for one or two years, but it’s not like Westbrook doubled currys points, 20% more reb, 20% more ast, and show 12%pts better"
"I think we have to agree to disagree here. For what it's worth, I think r/nba agrees with you in stats &gt; winning. I'll always value winning games and championships over putting up numbers though.   A modern day comparison is saying Russell Westbrook is better than Steph Curry a couple years ago because Russell put up a triple double all season. The reality is Steph's the better player even if his stats don't show it, and it's not close."
"1. Carmelo Anthony, New York Knicks 2. Vince Carter, Memphis Grizzlies 3. Dwight Howard, Atlanta Hawks 4. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 5. Chris Paul, Los Angeles Clippers."
I don’t know I think people play young guys expecting that the minutes will let them be all stars when most of the time it doesn’t work that way.  You don’t just force minutes on guys who haven’t earned it.  Imagine if Kobe started right away and didn’t have Eddie Jones in front of him.  Imagine if Kobe had all he could eat early on with Shaq and those established guys ahead of him.  He wouldn’t have been the guy he turned into.  He had a guy ahead that he had to be better then and then that guy was traded to make room for Kobe to be the starter.  Not everyone is Zion or Luka or Lebron.  Yeah their are some sure things but most of the time the rookies are bad and don’t contribute at all and if you give them minutes they develop bad habits that are hard to buck.  If a rookie is good he will often start the season on the bench and then the young guy will have earned being a started 2 months into the season.  Look at Russell Westbrook playing behind Earl Watson or Donovan Mitchell.  Look at Jokic behind Nurkic and so on.
Ben Simmons = Mona Lisa  Westbrook = Russell Westbrick  Brandon Ingram = Slender Man
"“Undisputed” is going to be contentious. For instance, even though Curry won the MVP unanimously in ‘16, you’d be hard pressed to consider the majority of people who thought he was the best basketball player in the world at that point (especially after the Finals), a plurality maybe but certainly not a majority. So, undisputed doesn’t just mean most people think [player X] is the best player in the world, it’s more that any challenge to [unofficial] the best player in the world title is in such the minority that it just seems silly and intentionally contrarian (because if we’re being honest, there’s never going to be a pure definitive answer here). And that narrows it down a good bit.  You could make a solid argument for Milan in the late ‘40s/early ‘50s and I won’t argue with you but there are also a number of factors (integration, lack of coverage, etc) where there’s a general lack of interest, but it’s a good starting point.  The ‘50s didn’t really have anyone that captured the imagination. The ‘60s had Russell, Wilt, Baylor, and Oscar all touted at some point to be the best player in basketball, so trying to get a consensus would be impossible for even any one season. People felt like bigs dominated, Wilt would outperform Russell but Russell would win more, but the skill level and control from Baylor and Robertson had some people favor them at various points.  Kareem after winning the ‘71 title + MVP is probably the first player to gain this recognition. And people at the time were basically waiting for this from about his senior year in high school all through college. Russell was gone, Chamberlain was old, Baylor was done, and Oscar was a supporting teammate, and none of Kareem’s contemporaries quite matched his level of talent, production, and star power. This probably lasts until ‘74 or ‘75 when Julius Erving first starts to make his ascent, Kareem’s still the best player in the world (and basketball touted him as such) but there’s enough popular groundswell from people that it’s an actual debate. Then in ‘76 Walton starts playing well enough and the Blazers start winning, and that’s enough for a certain segment of sports writers and basketball people to start to question it (although you’d never in a million years get Walton to agree).  The ‘80s then had Moses, Bird, and Magic, with Kareem and Erving still there at various points. So yeah, none of them.  Jordan is next although, I think it takes place a little later than most people and he doesn’t quite become undisputed until ‘93 after he beat Drexler and Barkley in consecutive years. The Drexler comparison was silly and no one really though he was better than Jordan but people still thought was close there for a bit, that they were in the same class in the early ‘90s. Magic still had enough burn that people weren’t willing to concede him until he was for sure out of the league, and Barkley made just enough noise. But yeah, from ‘93 until his retirement, no one was coming close to Jordan (if Shaq had stayed with the Magic and they rebounded in ‘97 it might’ve been a different story but that didn’t happen).  Shaq in ‘00 and ‘01: his status as the most dominant player in the world finally got root and with Duncan being hurt in the ‘00 playoffs and then the Spurs being dispatched without a fuss in ‘01 cemented Shaq at that point. Probably could’ve held on a bit longer and everyone knew a healthy Shaq could get the Lakers another title but he was hurt just enough and Duncan being back winning the MVP in ‘02 made that pretty brief.  After that, Duncan, Kobe, Garnett, with Dirk and Nash on the fringe, and then LeBron coming up.  LeBron doesn’t get it until his first title in ‘12, and then it just all feels silly for awhile to suggest anyone else. Chris Paul and Dwight Howard were either hurt or on worse teams, and Durant was coming but never quite there. It probably ends for LeBron after that ‘16 title, and he slipped enough that everyone agreed that he was the best player in the world when he wanted to be but that wasn’t all the time, so people felt comfortable suggesting Curry or Durant or even Harden or Westbrook.  Anywho, TLDR: Kareem, Jordan, Shaq, and LeBron."
"Iverson is 4th all time in minutes per game after Wilt, Russell, and Oscar, and 4th all time in usage% after Jordan, Westbrook, and Kobe.  He's basically the cautionary tale for athletes going that hard. Probably cost him years of his career."
Russell Westbrook ATM. It's very unusual to have someone be the most overrated player in the league at TWO different points in their career but I believe that's exactly where we are with Westbrook.
"He was the leading scorer, rebounder, and assist man on those nights but no he wasn't the reason they won those games. You're right. 103-24. That's his record when record a triple double that's a stat, u can't argue a statistic. At the end of the day Russell Westbrook is a superstar in the NBA"
"- Besides his passing, LeBron's game is not as pleasing to watch for me.  - There's nothing Kobe or Jordan about Kawhi's post-up moves, besides that he uses post-up moves like them.  - Kyle Lowry  - Russell Westbrook"

Russell Westbrook is the Charles Barkley of point guards.

Russell Westbrook that year statistically had a much bigger impact for his team than Luka has had for the Mavs. He was not stat padding.
"Not saying I agree/disagree with Lowry in the HOF, but using ASG selections is so biased towards Eastern conference players. Chris Bosh has 11 all star selections but only 1 all NBA selection. Meanwhile guys like Dirk and Duncan have only 3 or 4 more all star selections but 11+ more all NBA selections.   Bosh is a HOFer, but if he's in the West he's a 6x all star. I mean just look at Pau Gasol, he's an incredible PF and a HOFer no question, but he only has 6 all star games, 2 of which came during his only 2 seasons in the Eastern Conference. He missed ASG in the West while averaging 19/9, 18/9, 20/9 and 17/11. But unlike Bosh he has 4 All NBA nods. I think All NBA is way more telling than All Star selections which are a popularity contest and conference specific. If Lowry is in the West and going up against Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, James Harden, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook etc... you have got to imagine he has probably only 2-3 all star nods."
"This series was amazing to watch for several reasons:  * During the 2009-2010 season, the Thunder came out of nowhere (at the time, they weren't predicted to win much) to win 50 games and make the 8TH SEED and face the Lakers. People knew who Kevin Durant was, but not many people had been exposed to his game, or Russell Westbrook. At a time when Durant, Westbrook, and Harden were all just 21 and younger, the Thunder ended up taking the defending champions to 6 games. The Thunder were officially on the map (fun fact though, Harden only averaged 7 ppg in that series). [Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/sports/basketball/02lakers.html) is an article covering the impact that series had on teams' perception of the Thunder: * Earlier that season (correct me if I am wrong), Harden and Kobe got into it on the court when they started trash talking back and forth. Eventually, Durant joined in and they tried to mock/trash talk Kobe during what was a blowout win for the Thunder. I believe Kobe's response was ""you can't sit at my lunchtable yet"" (as in, they don't have the accolades to talk shit). * Fast forward to this series, which featured a 3-seed Lakers vs. the 2-seed Thunder. The Lakers were still relevant but it was clear they had run out of gas, and nobody outside of Kobe really gave a shit anymore after 3 straight Finals runs. This was also the year of peak Thunder (as we all know Harden left after this year), and it featured three future MVPs on the cusp of their primes (all were 23 or younger). The series wasn't really that close and the Thunder took it in 5.  It officially signaled the end of the Kobe/Lakers era (you can argue it ended when the Mavs beat them in 2011, but the Lakers were still considered title favourites in 2012), and ushered the Thunder/Spurs era from 2012-2014.  Kobe's final average for the series:  31 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 3.4 apg, including 42 points on 54% shooting as a goodbye."
Russell Westbrook is this sub's never ending wank.
"I think people were expecting some insane MJ asshole stories just to verify their opinions on him. The doc even touched on how the “MJ is a terrible person” narrative effected him because it’s mostly on how he approached basketball. I mean with some of the opinions on here about Jordan you would think he was an evil person. Very similar to Russell Westbrook, he’s an animal on the court but I’ve never heard anyone say a bad thing about him. People can’t separate who you are on a basketball court vs who you are off of it. His leadership style may not have been for everyone, but he admitted that. I don’t think he’s ever tried to act like he wasn’t a jerk to his teammates. But he did what he felt would work to win, and it worked."
"They're both all-time greats, I don't think they'd suddenly become much better.  If anything, they might do worse in this modern environment. The ability to soft-double makes posting up a much more difficult endeavor for post players like Mike and Hakeem. MJ isn't much of a floor-spacer either, with only two decent shooting years without a shortened 3-point line. For reference, Russell Westbrook and Draymond Green have combined for 2 seasons under .250 3P%. MJ has done that 6 times, in his early years, one of his championship seasons, and during that Wizards stint we don't talk about. And 5 of those 6 times, he was also under .190 3P%. The fact that he was remembered as a great shooter is testament to his 2-point shooting, and that is an increasingly less valuable shot on the floor given the rise of more efficient perimeter play."
Reminds me of Russell Westbrook explosion wise
Charles Barkley-Shaquille O’Neal-Russell Westbrook   *Members of the FTR Club*  Better known as the “fuck the rim” club.
"6'8"" Russell Westbrook who isn't consciously trying to get 10 assists every night."
"Oh well that settles it right? Who do you think is better at playing basketball, Russell Westbrook or Khris Middleton? I guess the Rockets are favorites to win the chip now."
Not KD’s fault his pg was Russell west brick. There’s a reason Westbrook hasn’t done shit since KD left. West brick is an awful 2 and an even worse 1.
"Russell Westbrook, serge ibaka, Enes Kanter  Bc KD can’t win with those cats"
"Off the top of my head:  Magic, Bird, Jordan, Kobe, Bron, Wilt, Shaq, Duncan, Hakeem, Russell, Shaq, KD, Steph, Moses, West, Oscar, D Rob, Dirk, Hondo, Wade, Dirk, Karl, Barkley, Kawhi, Elgin, Westbrook, Harden, Iverson, Pettit, KG, McHale, Barry, CP3, Nash, Pippen, Giannis, Dr J, Walton, Fraizer, Cousy, Reed, Thomas, Kidd, Stockton, Drexler, Hayes, McAdoo, Unseld, Ewing, Mourning"
LeBron James  Michael Jordan  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Magic Johnson  Wilt Chamberlain  Larry Bird  Shaquille O'Neal  Bill Russell  Kobe Bryant  Tim Duncan  Kevin Durant  Scottie Pippen  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Kevin Garnett  Allen Iverson  Charles Barkley
"At 22, Magic Johnson had Kareem on his team. Where is this going? Rose was a one man team against LeBron Bosh and Wade on the same squad. Save me the nonsense. Rose would have been on the same path Russell Westbrook is on now, if not better. 22 year old MVPs tend to get better, but theres nothing to back that up cause Rose was the only one. He was that fucking good."
Kidd was regarded as very physically strong and a good defender out of college. Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook were both phenomenal athletes. So yeah that’s in line with what I was saying.
"The knock against him is a lot of his rewards and stats came from ABA era, so his MVPs are discounted against say LeBron.    He also doesn't have enough FMVP to go with his rings.  A bit like the Kobe/Duncan situation.  So his rings are also discounted.  I think even with dismounting he should be ahead of LeBron on all time rankings until LeBron gets a few more rings.  But LeBron is too smart at stats padding (super luxury version of Russell Westbrook), not accepting rings unless he is the #1 option (otherwise he gives you his 2011 finals form), so his ranking is higher."
Russell Westbrook seems like he’s a good dad to his kids
Wait actually? Then that makes Russ the second or third cuz he has done it. [Russ perfect triple double](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/23/russell-westbrook-nbas-first-perfect-triple-double)
Someone find the comment from last year’s playoffs that said that he’d rather have DJ Augustin than Russell Westbrook on his team.
"I would argue Paul George and Russell westbrook, I’m not a big fan or putting a player too high after one good season   I’m not sold on luka over embiid or kyrie yet"
That the 90s was tough. That modern NBA players wouldn't succeed back then.   MJ was at the right place at the right time. He dominated an era where Big Men were the guys and we all know Big Men dont impact the game the same way athletic wing players do (unless you're Wilt or Shaq of course lol)   I mean come on. Forget about LeBron for a sec. Switch MJ with Russell Westbrook. Who the hell is stopping Russ in the 90s?
That's not hate. You're a Russell Westbrook fan. I'd think you would know what blind hate is lol
"When Russell Westbrook had his 31.6/10.7/10.4 MVP season, the Thunder were 16/30 in Offensive efficiency. Doncic's 28.7/9.3/8.7 has been a part of the most efficient offensive team ever. Doncic definitely has best player in the world potential.   Porzingis is very good too, another guy who doesn't get enough love for what he did this season is Tim Hardaway Jr."
"alright well in the interest of saving us both time i’ll give my list of top point guards, and i think that if someone has close to or even more than 10 players better and more accomplished than them **at their own position,** it should be ridiculous to rank them top 30 among all positions, so here we go...  1. magic johnson 2. isiah thomas 3. oscar robertson 4. stephen curry 5. steve nash 6. chris paul 7. jason kidd 8. gary payton 9. chauncey billups 10. john stockton (and i only rank him this high because of **career longevity** even though many of the players after him were **vastly superior** during their peak years) 11. walt frazier 12. russell westbrook 13. damian lillard 14. bob cousy can come after all those guys (he’s also overrated, but not nearly as egregiously as stockton is)  you know who’s actually underrated? karl (shit person, great player) malone. you wouldn’t even know stockton’s name if he didn’t have karl (2nd leading scorer of all time) malone and an archaic system built around a single main point guard dominating ALL assists for the team for 19 ENTIRE SEASONS where neither of them EVER missed time. john stockton was a really good player, but he SUCKS compared to the player people perceive him as.  stockton would be almost a NOBODY in today’s game, unless you gave him giannis or AD and a coach that insisted on the default offensive set running exclusively through stockton/giannis or AD pick n rolls for 19 FKN SEASONS (with stockton getting literally more than 80% of team assists like he did with the jazz many years).  meanwhile, all those other PGs on my list from past eras would be stars in their own right today. stockton however would not be, no way. easily the least impressive supposed “all-time great” ever."
"The only fair way to compare players from different eras is to evaluate how they did against their own competition. Otherwise you get into this endless rabbit hole of putting mid tier current players above all time greats from 40 years ago. It’s a stupid exercise. Yeah, if you took current Jimmy Butler and dropped him into the 60’s NBA, he’d probably dominate the entire league. Does that mean he should rank higher than Oscar Robertson all-time? Fuck no. Compare them to their own era.  This is why arguments with casual fans are pointless. They’re never going to understand the point I just made and will forever go on about how Russell Westbrook would be the GOAT if he played in the 70’s."
"Statistics and awards can tell a big part of the story but rarely do they tell the entire story. Russell Westbrook is amazing and so is Isiah Thomas. Maybe Russell's got a case.

I'm not saying that's what you're doing, but dude was just so, so, so, so much more than his box score.   And honestly, the same can be said for Russell Westbrook. People 30 years from now judging Westbrook, even when looking at his triple-double average, still aren't going to understand his on-court ferocity without context (watching him or going beyond the box score)."
Just looking at their peak:  PG: Chris Paul  SG: James Harden  SF: Paul George  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Serge Ibaka  6man: Russell Westbrook
"1. Steph Curry 2. Russell Westbrook 3. Dame Lillard 4. Allen Iverson 5. Kevin Garnett  Again, not saying these are the goat’s but my favourite players"
"That would be Russell Westbrook. The dude had a starting 5 of Steven Adams, Victor Oladipo, Enes Kanter, and Andre Roberson and him and he couldn’t get that team past win #1 in the playoffs"
"But the Thunder had Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook......"
You underestimate how great James Harden &amp; Russell Westbrook are.
"Russell Westbrook, we'd have absolutely no use for him and would actively take away from Ja's development"
Stockton is closer to being the 3rd best player ever than Westbrook is to having the best season ever.   Stockton is like arguably the 13th best player ever.  Russell Westbrooks MVP season isn't even a top 20 individual season ever.
"I think Jordan is a better player.  He’s a better offensive player and was a better defensive player.  I think Lebron gets too much of a bonus for his “all around game” in this argument.  All around in this case means he averages marginally more assists and rebounds. If that’s the metric then Russell Westbrook has been the best all around player in the league these last few years and we know that’s not the case.  MJs numbers in the playoffs and finals up until his first three peet alone are better than Lebrons.  Yes Lebro . Has longevity, but that’s honestly a weak argument because it basically punishes Jordan for not having access to the same medical/training advancements that Lebron does."
"I mean tbf, Russ, KD +, I think, Ibaka all took deals to help OKC. Russ got less + KD took a 5 year deal without a player option. Harden just felt that he'd sacrified enough, considering he was already coming off the bench (although he did pitch that idea to Presti to try and get drafted by them)  Edit: Russ also took a 5 year deal without a player option  Edit #2:  &gt; look at how much long-term money Russell Westbrook and Ibaka just sacrificed to stick around.  Westbrook did sign a hefty extension last January, but it could have been even bigger. Thanks to a new provision in the CBA, players can be eligible for a ""super max"" extension after their rookie contract. If a player agrees to a ""super max"" deal and then makes one of the all-NBA teams twice in his first four years, he could earn an average of $3 million more per season over the course of a five-year deal.  Westbrook could have added that to his new deal and, after his second straight all-NBA honor last year, he would have reaped the benefits. Instead, he agreed to simply sign the standard max deal, saving his team a little bit in the process just to help keep the band together.  And Ibaka? Let's call a spade a spade here. In a league where Brook Lopez and Roy Hibbert garnered multiple $60 million contract offers as restricted free agents, Ibaka would have too. Given his age and shot-blocking skills, he probably would have been worth it too. By signing now, Ibaka is sacrificing at least $10 million over the course of his contract, all in the name of keeping the band together.  (https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/8/19/3252350/serge-ibaka-contract-james-harden-oklahoma-city-thunder)  Ibaka took less also"
"Yea this is bullshit. Did you grow up watching Paul Pierce or are you a 20 year old trying to piece together the past by looking at YouTube clips and Basketball Reference? T-Mac, Carter, Pierce, Marbury, Ray Allen, Roy, AI, Steve Francis. They were all 2000s guards and they were all spoken of in the same light. I lived in that era. That was high school for me. Wasn’t no one saying eww don’t compare Paul Pierce to them. It sounds dumb to even type. That’s like saying Damien Lillard can’t be compared to Russell Westbrook today. Obviously he can. And Pierce was to those guards I named back then. The only guard who transcended that group of guards was Kobe. The rest are definitely comparable to each other and Pierce is definitely in that camp. If anything he’s the next most accomplished considering none of them did anything in the post season."
"I think KD warned people not to pull a huge bitch move like he did (leaving his co star Russell Westbrook for the team that came back from 3 to 1 to beat them in the WCF, a team that went 73 and 9 and to game 7 of The Finals, and ruining the party in the league for a couple of season)  But leaving for a team that has beat you is definitely more normalized.   If the Raptors beat Giannis in the playoffs months before he's a FA, I do think that that puts a little bit of dent in the Giannis to TOR chances. But the Kawhi playoffs should not affect it much"
"First off, I believe lebron is a better basketball player than Jordan. Just hasn't one as many chips mostly because the league today is more competitive and has better players.   But you can't compare the two because of evolution. Lebron has the newer genes. It's only 15 years but just look at the league. Watch Jordan highlights. Those defenders in MJ's time move around like they have knee injuries. Russell Westbrook would have scored 70 almost every game.   Jordan was born before Lebron and didn't have the same level of training/supplements/competition as Lebron. Level of competition is what motivates people to be better"
Ever seen live is more interesting. Mine would be   1. Kobe Bryant   2. Kevin Durant  3. Kawhi Leonard  4. Russell Westbrook  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Blake Griffin  7. Deron Williams  8. James Harden  9. Pau Gasol  10. DeAndre Jordan
1. Russell Westbrook 2. Demar DeRozan
The early day highlights remind me a lot of Russell Westbrook
"This was a truly magical moment.  Growing up as a HUGE basketball fan from Oklahoma. praying and hoping we can somehow get an NBA team. We get one through sheer happenstance, knowing full well we probably won’t be very good.   Draft Kevin Durant, draft Russell Westbrook, then draft our ginobili esque 6th man in Harden. In only 3 seasons (?!?) we’re going toe-to-toe with fucking KOBE and the LAKERS in the Playoffs?!?   I remember where I was for almost every game of that 2012 run. ‘Magical’ is the only way I know how to describe it, because a meteoric rise like that just doesn’t happen in professional sports. What a fun time that was"
it’s really not though.    if you don’t take team success into account then Russell Westbrook has been the best player in the league for 4 years
"while this kind of dissection is getting to be annoying, there is some importance to note the differences, and Magic is spot on. Lebron is the best all around player of all time - and IMO it's not even close - and MJ is the greatest player of all time - and IMO it's not even close.   It's the same way I look at Kyrie Irving. To me, he is without a doubt the most skilled point guard in the league. There isn't a single thing on the court he cannot do, and IMO he is better at these skills than any other point guard on a piece of paper. But I do not consider him the best or greatest point guard in the game. Or the way Russell Westbrook, on a piece of paper, will be looked at as one of the best all around point guards of all time - dude averaged a triple double. No other player, let alone a point guard, has come close to this. But does this all around ability make him the best in the game? Not a single reasonable person really considers Westbrook the best in the game.   MJ's abilities, his achievements, and his overall narrative is greater than anyone before him or after. He's the GOAT and I think Lebron is a close 2nd."
I could argue that Russell Westbrook is the greatest non champion athlete of all time. But I wouldn't want to waste the breath.
"Russell Westbrook was all NBA second team , Serge Ibaka was the DPOY and James Harden was the sixth man. Dwayne Wade was all nba third team and Chris Bosh was an all star. Those teams were pretty even ."
"&gt; Dallas is doing so much better with him he must be legit.  He has very mediocre [on/off numbers](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency). When he is on the bench or when he was injured a few games his team was very competitive even without him. Just [his bench alone is top 5 net rating in the league. ](https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;StarterBench=Bench) The fact that he has a top 5 bench in the league and carries them to a 7th team in the west isn't really a carry imo. If he had the bench of Booker, Trae Young, or Damian Lillard he would easily be out of the playoffs like all 3 of those players currently are.  &gt;But he's a selfish stat stuffer?  As a sophomore his USG% jumped up a crazy amount from rookie to sophomore year. However even as a ROOKIE his USG% was higher than any year of Steve Nash, John Stockton, Magic Johnson, and Chris Paul. People say ""he has such a high USG% because he is depended on to carry his team"" but this just isn't the case and his team is statistically almost as good when he is off. He takes a top 10 offense in the league (would be tied at number 8 with the Utah Jazz) and turns them into the number 1 offense but he makes their defense worse by almost an equal amount. People see the gawdy volume stats and russell westbrook style uncontested rebounds (that have zero correlation with winning) and compare him to Lebron James and Michael Jordan and say he is the best 20 year old ever and will be top 5 alltime etc etc. He is below average FT% and below average 3% two years in a row now with negative defense."
Russell Westbrook.  He's a fucking baby in every sense of the word.
"I mean, isn't this the exact opposite argument people make for Russell Westbrook? Russ can't shoot threes and does, and it's like the 'most obvious answer' that he shouldn't shoot threes. If the entire 76ers organization knows Ben Simmons is a bad shooter, why is him shooting all of a sudden the missing link?"
"No he didn’t lol. You can’t look at longevity and say he should’ve won more in a certain year. The only arguable season he deserved it was 2006 and that is extremely arguable because he was a 6th seed or something. You can’t name a season other than that in which he was “robbed.” In my years of watching ball, the criteria (with one outlier in Russell Westbrook) was usually the most outstanding player/performer that season with a 1 or 2 seed in the conference."
"&gt; 1) so Kobe has either the same or more amount of MVPs and FMVPs as Duncan? i don't see ""less"" in your comment  So Tim Duncan has 11 All NBA First Teams? So Tim Duncan was as crucial to his 5th championship as Kobe was to each of his 5? Tim Duncan has 9 All Defensive First selections? Scoring titles? Your nitpicking 1-2 items and the semantics of the word 'less' is trivial at best. Kobe Bryant outplayed Tim Duncan and the Spurs in multiple times and eliminated them, directly. You can say he 'won' the series MVPs against Tim Duncan in all of those match-ups.  &gt; 2) Okay you don't like PER, what about VORP? what about WS or WS/48? What about Net Rating? Which advanced stat do you like or are they all just BS?  List out every single one that you want. By your metrics, Chris Paul is better than Tim Duncan in every single way. You haven't changed a goddamned thing. And Hakeem Olajuwon is fucking 46th and you're citing that as a valuable metric? I honestly didnt even bother reading the remainder of your post. You're citing bullshit cumulative career statistics, when on a season-by-season basis, you're implying that:  VORP: Chris Paul, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Dwyane Wade, Tracy McGrady, Russell Westbrook, KG, Shaq, Bird, Stockton, David Robinson, and Grant Hill have all put up VASTLY superior seasons than Tim Duncan.  BPM: I guess Giannis's current season is literally the 5th best of all time -- nearly 50% superior than any season Tim Duncan has ever put together?  WS/48 for CAREER: Chris Paul is your 4th best player of all time after Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, and David Robinson? Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and James Harden round out the top 10?  Dude, really, shut the fuck up. Aggregate stats give a ballpark of player value, AT BEST. With Defensive stats, it's SIGNIFICANTLY less reliable.  I'd eat a bowl of shit if you answered correctly how to calculate any of the metrics you're citing in realtime.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Tim Duncan's teams were NOT weak because of ""salary"" you dipshit. You have half this sub saying Kobe is 'selfish for not taking paycuts' to make his team better and yet it's somehow still a plus for Tim Duncan to be on teams with lower salaries? The Big 3 Heat were probably a trash team as well right, because they were able to afford it via salary? All players took salary cuts. It's the most idiotic response out there.  Yes, you wasted your time replying because your reply is stupid."
A team led by James Harden or Russell Westbrook will never be a championship caliber team
"&gt; that's like saying Manu is better than Shaq cause he has a more diverse game  The qualifier was 'to the same success and accolades'. Manu did not achieve that level of production or success, and so it is irrelevant. This is more related to why Russell Westbrook is considered better than Oscar Robertson.  &gt; this has nothing to do with their basketball abilities  Yes -- it speaks to the first item above, and is driven by the value of the mid-range. Second, this is used as last-bullet value points, and intended not to be the strongest reason.  &gt; i have no idea how 08 olympics proves he was the best player longer than Duncan was.  Ok. Here is the subtext. Most people on this sub will not give you 2008 as Kobe Bryant being the best player in the game. They might give you 2005-2006, exclusively. In the 2008 Olympics, the top 10-12 players in the league were on the Olympic Team. This includes Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, etc. In the only competitive game during the only competitive moments, all players completely deferred to Kobe Bryant. This indicates that, in fact, Kobe Bryant may have actually been the best player in the league during that time, quite possibly for a minimum of a 3 season span. This is backed by coaches' surveys during the time period, as well as the resounding testimony of players and player interviews.  &gt; You know who also has great PER and advanced stats that aren't bigs? Wade, Lebron, Curry, CP3, Harden, KD, Westbrook, MJ, Bird, Magic. Wade, Lebron, CP played at the same time Kobe did (~'03 - '11 if you wanna compare same era stats).  Ok, so PER is the one you want to go with. Tim Duncan's highest PER season is BELOW Kobe Bryant's highest PER season. PER is among the weakest of metrics, and by your own admission, in that case all those players you listed are better than both Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant. Is that true? No. Then why fucking bring it up at all?  His advanced metrics are NOT lagging that far behind other all time greats is the first thing, but the point is that the formulation for most of those metrics weight specific things very clearly. In fact, many are also intended to put MJ seasons at the top -- as part of self-validation. If I create a metric and the season I expect to pop up on top does, it must be a valid metric. You can read about their distributions in their configuration in bballref. Many are patterned after a specific season prototype.  What YOU and others need to ask yourself is, if all of these metrics paint so many other players as so good:  1. Why do we only use them to disparage Kobe's rankings? Forget Kobe vs. Tim Duncan. Why not Lebron vs. Chris Paul? Why not Charles Barkley vs. Shaq? That's the picture that these advanced stats paint.  2. Why do these metrics not clearly translate to Kobe's obvious success, or winning basketball? 5 championships? 2 FMVP? Where are Barkley's? Stockton's / Malone's? Chris Paul's? Harden's? We saying we can replace Kobe with these players on each of the championship runs and they win? It's laughable.  &gt; It's hard for me to believe you love Tim Duncan to death, but use such weak and incorrect arguments.  You've confused your own misunderstanding and weak arguments for mine; you don't even have a cohesive understanding of what you personally value in a player, and don't even have clear understanding of the aggregate metrics you're using.  &gt; He never lost in embarrassing fashion in the playoffs.  2001 Western Conference Finals.  - Game 3, to go down 3-0. Lakers: 111, Spurs: 72. Tim Duncan: 3-14, -27 box.  - Game 4, elimination. Lakers: 111, Spurs: 82. Result: Lakers win, sweep, 4-0. Tim Duncan: 5-10, -17 box.  Seems like you're full of shit and probably didn't watch either play in their respective primes. You're literally just making things up.  &gt; Also you mention head to head matchups. In 2003/04 the Lakers spent 20M more on their salaries.  I didn't mention 2003/2004 in those head to head match-ups. But yeah, they won that one too. And Kobe led the team in that series as well.  &gt; In 2003 when the Spurs won, they won by having 10M less salary. To me that says way more. The Lakers couldn't beat a team that spent almost 15% less then they did.  Lmfao okay, whatever. How many team discrepancies are there based on salary? Who gives a shit. Some teams get good players and get to keep them on rookie contracts for a long time. Other teams have to dip into the cap to retain their RFAs. Other teams just need to pay more for star players.  Everything you've said is either irrelevant, contradictory, or straight up wrong. And you're calling me out for misinformation."
Would it be weird to say Russell Westbrook? People talk about him like he's a negative ball player.
Lowry is a better shooter than Russell Westbrook.
"Yes, people are just stupid.  Put Russell Westbrook on last year's Raptors with Kawhi in the exact circumstances (against an injured Warriors squad) and they also win the championship, probably in an easier fashion.  Is Lowry a better decision maker/PG? Probably, but he can't shine Westbrook's shoes."
"Russell Westbrook doesn't deserve a lot of the criticism he gets. Triple Doubles are meaningless, but having Stephen Adams box out for him legit made sense as you save a pass from your center and Westbrook is one of the best rebounding guards ever. In last year's Portland series, he was accused of making bad decisions and trying to play hero ball, but there was no other way they could even imagine winning. Paul George was injured, but he was not playing at an NBA level, so he should have taken better shots, but definitely shouldn't have passed them up for pg13."
Orlando can't guard Trae Young.  We also cant guard Kemba Walker.  Or Russell Westbrook.  Or Kyrie Irving.  Or Damien Lillard.  But oddly enough we do well against Steph.
"I don't care how many titles Pop wins or anything, no coach will ever be better than Phil Jackson.   Tim Duncan gets too much consideration for what happened in 13 and 14 when that was a clear team effort. Tony Parker finished above him for the MVP race. From 08 on he's completely overrated.  Tyson Chandler was the most important reason why the 2011 Mavs won the title.   Ben Wallace should've been seen as a superstar on par with AI.   It's a crime AI didn't transition to a sixth man role better.   At the time of the AD trade, Brandon Ingram was head and shoulders better than anything anyone else offered and it was bizarre to see people make cases for someone like Dario Saric, whose not good.   Vince Carter wouldn't be in the league if the league didn't shift in his positional favor.   Trae Young can not lead a team to the playoffs being the number one option with no way to get better at D.   Devin Booker needs to just request a trade.   Chris Paul is the greatest to never win an MVP award, the second greatest is Dwight Howard.  Dwight Howard was better than Lebron from 07-10.   Kobe Bryant was the best player of his generation, and it was never more visible in the 2008 Olympics final game. He was also one of the least athletic superstars in his career's second half and so all we ever saw was like 75% of what he could do, which is fucking insane.   Kevin Durant was somehow better than Steph Curry and it's completely perplexing as to how he did that.  The Kings choked in G7 and that's why they didn't make the finals.  Magic Johnson's career ending so soon in the 1990s is the greatest what if in NBA history, the second greatest is Bill Walton in the early 80s.  Wilt Chamberlain was an unstoppable freak and is probably the greatest individual player of all time. Michael Jordan would struggle to beat peak Wilt in 1 on 1, and that's to no fault of his own. MJ, Phil Jackson, Scotty, Horace, Dennis -- this should be considered the greatest collective effort and coaching performance of all time.  Pat Riley is too good at his job to not lead whatever team he's associated to greatness, the Heat may, as soon as next year, find themselves competing.   Ben Simmons shouldn't be a point guard that initiates the offense if he can't shoot. Russell Westbrook shouldn't have been either and the fact that they were stunts the other places of the game they could impact.   If the Spurs make the playoffs this year I will be angry at every Spurs fan who considers this keeping the playoff streak alive.   Andre Drummond should just be out of the league, he is always going to be a guy with great potential whom teams don't understand how to unlock. He might be destined to be a role player at best."
Russell Westbrook - $4  Avery Bradley - $1  Khris Middleton - $3  Serge Ibaka - $2  David Robinson - $5
"\&gt; Kobe's peak was longer and as a result his individual statistical accomplishments are greater.  what individual statistical accomplishments does Kobe have other than more points scored?  you say Kobe was dropping 27 a game at age 34...Duncan made all nba first team at age 36  Duncan also has an extra MVP and an extra FMVP..  The only people who have Kobe over Duncan are people who don't realize there's more to the game than ppg.  it's yahoo sports, but here's a rough breakdown of their career  [https://sports.yahoo.com/whose-nba-career-was-better-kobe-bryant-vs-tim-duncan-164812274.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/whose-nba-career-was-better-kobe-bryant-vs-tim-duncan-164812274.html)  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; Duncan averaged 23.3 points, with career highs of 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game. The only other player to produce those numbers in a single season: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who did it six freaking times. (Speaking of which, we should throw him into a “Who was better?” with the GOATs from other eras.)  Those who averaged Kobe’s stat line at his apex: Kareem ... Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Rick Barry, Clyde Drexler, Tracy McGrady, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, James Harden and Russell Westbrook."

I mean they gave MVPs to Russell Westbrook.
"&gt;we had no way of knowing it at the time  Good GMs spend significant amount of time and money trying to figure who has the personality to make it in the NBA. Sorry, that is a lame excuse for an NBA professional.  Pistons just hired Troy Weaver and one the stories he tells is about Russell Westbrook and how when they showed up for his individual workout he was sitting his car because he had arrived 2 hours early. Weaver said he knew right then he want to pick him.  The ability to know who has the desire and who doesn't is what separates the good GMs from the the mediocre ones. This just makes it obvious which one Griffin is."
That is what I am talking about!  Pancake!  Imagine how people would look at Russell Westbrook differently if we just called him Pancake.
"What is your point here? That Trae isn’t KD or Westbrook? Yes, if we had a 22 year old Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook as his co-star, we would be in a better position than we are now with Trae. Is someone arguing this with you?  And even OKC won 23 games in KD’s second year. And then kd turned into KD and they became a legit NBA playoff team. We all know Trae has major holes in his game, but he isn’t the type of 2 way player to carry a replacement level team (which we were this year AND we had JC miss 25 games on top of it). Let’s build an actual professional NBA team around his offense and see what happens."
Russell Westbrook is more of a winner than CP statistically speaking
For now. If he ever learns how to play defense that distinction will probably revert back to Russell Westbrook.
Russell westbrook heavily disagrees with this
"**IMO** I think it's because of the video series he had on ESPN. He did a whole video series on ESPN where he was going to head to. The video was hyping the fans up because that's what the video series was for. 15 minutes before the official signings started, at a party he stated that he's there to stay and wanted to win a championship with them. Then later on after he re-signed, he said that he already had made up his mind long before so there was no reason to make a video of hyping everything up.   Like many other fan bases, Laker fans get salty. Except the difference is that Laker fans can get salty as hell. So that plus the suspense to lead to disappointment really got to us. Hence, the booing. I still think it's a dick move giving up on Thunder after a year he said he wanted to win a championship with them. But hey, it worked out for Thunder fans and they're actually doing just as good or maybe even better after trading Russell Westbrook and Paul George. So I'm happy for them."
On Independence he declared himself Independent from Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook
Steph Curry Kyrie Irving Luka Doncic Russell Westbrook Chris Paul Kemba Walker Trae Young Jamal Murray Ja Morant Kyle Lowry
wtf why is Houston Rockets legend Russell Westbrook wearing a blue jersey?
"There are lots of great PGs in the league.  Tier 1: Curry.  Tier 2: Doncic, Lillard.  Tier 3: Westbrook, Young, Irving, CP3.  Tier 4: Simmons, Lowry, Kemba, Jrue  Tier 5: Morant, Fox, SGA, Bledsoe, Russell  Tier 6: VanVleet, Dinwiddie, Rubio, Murray, Brogdon, maybe Rose?"
"&gt;PS: try not to pick players like Giannis, LeBron, Ben Simmons, or James Harden as they are not your traditional point guards.. thanks.  Let's analyze this a bit, using basketballreference's Play-by-Play stats to help us understand how often these players play Point Guard.  Giannis makes sense here. Like Jokic, he is a distributor but zero of his minutes have appeared in the point guard slot.   Harden makes sense here too - partly that his minutes are mostly distributed between SG (40%) and SF (55%) and not PG (1%), but also that he plays beside a very traditional point guard in Russell Westbrook.  LeBron you could argue either way, I think. BBREF has 57% of his minutes as a PG.  Ben Simmons has 93% of his minutes assigned as PG. Why on earth would he not count?"
"i wouldn’t say they were outright more talented than the 2012-16 thunder, the raptors for sure worked harder and played a more complete team defense under nurse, kawhi and lowry  those thunder teams were perennial fake contenders not because they weren’t talented, but because they were giving max money to russell westbrook and because westbrook and durant have always sucked on defense so no one ever bought in like the raptors did"
"Players who I would rather have than Sabonis (And I'll be generous and exclude injured and recently injured guys like Curry, Durant, Kyrie, Oladipo etc)  Harden, Westbrook, Lillard, LeBron, AD, Jokic, Towns, Mitchell, Gobert, Kawhi, PG, Booker, Fox, Doncic, Porzingis, CP3, Embiid, Simmons, Brogdon, Kemba, Tatum, Brown, Siakam, Butler, Bam, Beal, Trae, Giannis.  That's already 28 without injured players and guys who I personally have as close (Russell, Turner, Dinwiddie etc)"
"Idk it’s hard to say, the game would be so different. Do you think there should be offside-ish style penalties for such a big court, similar to soccer?   Idk I honestly I am thinking someone with a skill set like pre-injury John Wall would clean up here. So I guess my answer would be Russell Westbrook."
I used to like these questions but Russell Westbrook has sort of ruined it for me. There was a time when you could have told me someone would average a triple double and I would have assumed they were the predominate force in the game.
Do you think Russell Westbrook is as good as Curry? Because he’d be roughly the same as him
"That's good, but you know Adams did so much work boxing out the cow and then let Russell Westbrook run in to milk it and pad his gallons per game.   /s"
I'm not sure if the rest of the NBA is aware but literally every single day in OKC was declared Russell Westbrook day

"Ok let's be clear about something. This ""great efficiency"" you're talking about is less than 2 field goal percentage points higher than LeBron's 2015 finals output. A.K.A the series where people often blast LeBron's apparently terrible efficiency. Now, to your other point. KD was not the Warrior's defensive focus in that series. I even saw a quote on here that I think was from Draymond Green saying the same thing. KD and Russ shot themselves out of that series, but the Warriors defense focused on limiting contributions outside of those two. As for your point about KD, let's look at each of those years. In 2011, KD played well, but the team around him was young and his play wasn't enough. They lost to the Mavs, who were on fire that postseason and would win the championship. In the 2012 finals, KD played great, but the Heat just had way more talent offensively. In 2013, KD suffered from a similar problem, as Russell Westbrook was hurt in the Grizzlies series. When you're the only offensive threat, your efficiency drops, just as it did for LeBron and Kyrie. The only defense to contain KD was the 13-14 Spurs, who were also one of the better defensive teams in recent years. Literally no other team has done it successfully. They limited his touches, and shots, because that is what schemes to stop players generally do. It takes a generational defense to stop KD, and the Cavs didn't have that, so they tried to stop Steph and hope it was enough. It wasn't, and the reason for that was KD, hence the finals MVP. The next year, the Cavs reversed course, and there you saw what happens when a decidedly average defensive team makes it their goal to shut down KD (although they didn't commit to this, and even in the middle of games would seem to flip who they wanted to limit. God that finals was a shitshow for the Cavs) especially when there's another generational scorer on the other team. Because of that scheming choice, the 2018 finals was Steph's to lose, but the Cavs targeted him in game 3, he shot like shit, and KD bailed the team out. If you want to talk about a finals MVP he deserved, I'm much more on board with the 2015 argument."
"They're awesome in the clutch, too, which could mean the difference if they get into any close games- [Film Study- How OKC's three-guard lineup dominates in the clutch](https://www.nba.com/article/2020/06/29/schuhmann-film-study-oklahoma-city-thunder)  ---  (quoted from the article by John Schuhmann)  Of the 22 teams that will continue their season at Disney World in July, none have depended on clutch play more than the Oklahoma City Thunder.  The Thunder have played a league-high 42 games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Of the Thunder's 40 wins, 29 (73%) have been within five in the last five. Only the Charlotte Hornets (17/23, 74%) had a higher ratio of wins that have come in the clutch. OKC is just 11-11 in games that weren't within five in the last five.  The Thunder's success in close games overlaps with their success with all three of their playmaking guards - Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder - on the floor. OKC has outscored its opponents by an incredible 28.6 points per 100 possessions in 401 total minutes with the three guards on the floor. That's the best on-court NetRtg, by a healthy margin, among 602 three-man combinations that have played at least 300 minutes together. More than half (212) of those minutes have come in the fourth quarter or overtime, with 104 of those counting as ""clutch"" minutes.  The Thunder have outscored their opponents by 268 total points in those 401 minutes (32.1 per 48) with all three guards in the game, and they've been outscored by 111 points in 2,691 minutes otherwise. They have twice as many wins (they're 16-20) as any other team in games they trailed after the third quarter. Though the three guards have averaged less than seven minutes per game together, those minutes have been *the difference between a loss and a win 13 times this season.  (*Example: In a four-point win in Phoenix on Jan. 31, the Thunder were a plus-22 in 9:46 with all three on the floor and outscored by 18 points in 38:14 otherwise.)  There are 11 players that have shot better than 50% on at least 40 clutch field goal attempts. Three of the 11 are Gilgeous-Alexander (57.4%), Paul (53.5%) and Schroder (51.1%).  Very little of that clutch scoring has been a result of passing. The Thunder have had the league's most efficient clutch offense (124.0 points scored per 100 possessions) with its lowest clutch assist rate (by a wide margin), having recorded assists on just 33.8% of their clutch baskets. Paul (4/46), Gilgeous-Alexander (5/27) and Schroder (10/24) have been assisted on less than 20% of their 97 total clutch buckets.  It's very much a my turn, your turn situation. In 1,387 minutes total minutes on the floor together, Paul and Gilgeous-Alexander have just 48 total assists to each other. In the Rockets' iso-heavy offense, James Harden and Russell Westbrook have 122 total assists to each other in fewer (1,348) minutes on the floor together.  But the three guards have been effective enough when it's been their turn. The Thunder are the only team with three players - Gilgeous-Alexander, Paul and Schroder - that have averaged at least seven pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game, according to Synergy play-type tracking. And they're the only team with three guys (same three) that have averaged at least 10 drives per game.  Previous editions of this series have noted the off-the-dribble success of the Celtics and Jazz. Overall, the Thunder, who rank 14th offensively this season, haven't been as efficient as either of those two teams. Both Boston and Utah have more off-the-dribble weapons than OKC, which doesn't bring all three of its weapons together until the last few minutes of each half.  When they've brought all three weapons together, the Thunder have been ridiculously good. In their last 24 appearances together, the trio of Gilgeous-Alexander, Paul and Schroder had a negative plus-minus just three times.  The supporting cast has been solid. Danilo Gallinari has the eighth highest true shooting percentage (61.1%) among the 55 players averaging at least 18 points per game. Steven Adams has been huge on the glass, while Nerlens Noel has been both efficient offensively and disruptive defensively off the bench. (The screen-setting of both centers has also been critical to the Thunder's off-the-dribble attack.) Luguentz Dort and Terrance Ferguson are two more reasons why the Thunder have a top-10 defense for a fourth straight season.  But the Thunder's success in the clutch has been driven by the playmakers. And they each have their own way of getting to their spots."
"Spending 550 a day, taking daily virus tests, and sitting in quarantine for 2 weeks just to ask Russell Westbrook rather the Rockets wanted it more or if the other team just lost the game."
OKC got big overrated on this sub because they 'blew it up but are still competitive'-- but they didn't really blow it up they traded Paul George for Gallo and Russell Westbrook for Chris Paul.
"With the backup day being July 16th, also Russell Westbrook day. How neat!"
It’s cool that it landed on Russell Westbrook day too
" &gt;Russell Westbrook has the size and athleticism of a bigger player, and fellow Rockets like James Harden, P.J. Tucker, and Eric Gordon are all thicker and stronger than their listed heights as well. This isn't ""smallball"" as much as ""small and girthy ball."" ""ChodeBall.""  This gave me a good chuckle."
Wasn't even the best person named Russell Westbrook on the team. Their water boy of the same name was often seen dusting him in 1 on 1's
Russell Westbrook  Did you see that Bleacher Report edit of him with a Harden like beard a couple of weeks ago? He looked like a beast!
oh yeah Westbrook [held him back](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2017/11/29/victor-oladipo-praises-russell-westbrook-during-career-year-i-learned-so-much-from-him/)
"I dont know, id say guys like Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Demar Derozan, Bradley Beal etc are more or less equal on defense.   Williams has been much better defensively under Doc River than before though."
"67 players in NBA history have made 2 or more 1st teams all NBA, and 52 players have at least 3. Melo has zero 1st teams.  Among the guys who have 2: Russell Westbrook, John Stockton, Gary Payton, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi,   Additionally, Patrick Ewing, Clyde Drexler, and Dominique Wilkins all have just one all NBA team.  all NBA is based on position, and some years are deeper than others, but even so, I don't think Carmelo has accomplished enough top be top 50 all time.  There are even guys like Paul George, who is not currently better than Melo, but at the end of his career? PG's best season is better than Melo's best, who knows what George will look like at the end of his career"
Russell Westbrook and Jim Tomsula are two ships passing in the night.
"In my opinion recent examples include:  Russell Westbrook in 2017:  Before the season started it was hyped up as Westbrook's revenge year.  During the season, the triple double started being hyped up to be far more than an arbitrary (albeit very impressive) statistical milestone to the extent where the casual fan might think it's the greatest thing one can do in basketball.  Westbrook's inefficiency and turnovers were ignored, and the fact that they were a six seed was also (since the media took over MVP voting in 1980 no player on a team lower than a two seed had ever won MVP)."
"I don't think we ever got to see it. It would have been to be the lead dog on a team without Russell Westbrook, as far as legacy goes."
"AD said this, PG said this, KD said this, Kyrie said this, etc. Hell even Russell Westbrook of all people finally cracked and asked for a trade."
"??? Use some common sense. OP was specifically taking about *first hand* knowledge. Green was born in '90. You think he has ""first hand knowledge"" of the discipline of guys like Bill Russell, Wilt, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, etc. during their playing careers? How would that even work?  Again, use some common sense instead of pushing some stupid equivalency.  &gt;Your claim basically implies no fan should discuss the NBA at all.   What? No... It just implies that we shouldn't claim people know something ""first hand"" if they really don't. Honestly, I'm not even sure why people are so upset about this concept.  It's like if you think that Westbrook is a better locker room presence than Bill Russell. That's totally fine. You can have that opinion and we can discuss it. That doesn't mean it makes sense for someone to claim that you would ""know first hand"" despite you not having any first hand info on Russell as a locker room presence.  Can you really not see the difference? This shit isn't rocket science, buddy."
"PG: Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Russell Westbrook SG: James Harden Jimmy Butler Paul George SF: LeBron James Kawhi Leonard Khris Middleton PF: Anthony Davis Blake Griffin Kevin Love C: Joel Embiid Karl Anthony-Towns Bam Adebayo  Reserves: Chris Paul Bradley Beal DeMar DeRozan Jayson Tatum LaMarcus Aldridge  Any players like Luka and Giannis would play for their country and I didn't put any rookies. Also left out injured players such as KD, Kyrie, and Klay."
"I played poker at a casino with Russell Westbrook this year a month or so before the season was suspended, he was actually pretty nice and friendly despite having to politely shut down a ton of annoying/nosy people that kept trying to come up to him and talk to him. What struck me about him in particular was how much he giddily enjoyed the sort of inside jokes that poker has (""Omg look at all the outs I missed!"" or ""Good fold, I flopped the WORLD that hand"") and made me realize despite how crazy rich and famous NBA players are there's certain specific types of social interaction that they just don't get to have all that often.  He also casually ate two distinct dinners during the session lol, like he ate a full order of singapore noodles in a big aluminum takeout pan and then an hour later his assistant/bodyguard got him another full dish that he polished off effortlessly."
"If I may, an asterisks for the 2013 championship is Russell Westbrook had his knee smashed by Patrick Beverley. That season the Thunder topped the West with a 60-22 record. They were the team to beat."
Lmao you go tell that to Russell Westbrook
1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Luka Doncic 4. Damian Lillard 5. Russell Westbrook 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Trae Young 8. Chris Paul 9. Ben Simmons 10. Kyle Lowry
"All I said was that we make fun of Laker fans for thinking Bradley is better. I mean, they all watched Bradley ride the bench with us last season while Bev started. And raw numbers and eye test easily show that Bev is better if you watch us. But since you used my post as an excuse to sneak-diss, have some [facts](https://213hoops.com/pat-bev-trick-yall-crowd/#:~:text=If%20all%20Beverley%20did%20was,13%20when%20he%20does%20not.).   &gt; The top-5 scoring guards in the Western Conference are James Harden, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Russell Westbrook, and Devin Booker. Patrick Beverley has guarded these five on 115 possessions this season, and allowed just 40 points on 26.7% shooting.  &gt; Since last season, the Clippers are 82-40 (.672%) when Pat Bev plays, and just 7-13 (.350) when he does not.  &gt; Bev's 3.00 AST/TO ratio is 3rd among starting point guards, trailing just CP3's 3.20 mark and Ricky Rubio's 3.21 mark for the top spot in that category. This efficiency with the ball is not a new trend for Pat Bev, as this is something he has long been proficient in. Last season, his AST/TO ratio was 3.53, which ranked 2nd amongst all starting point guards, only trailing Darren Collison's 3.67 mark.  &gt; Bev's defense, playmaking, and shooting are all undeniably elite. The final area of his game that warrants recognition is his rebounding. Patrick Beverley is averaging 5.6 REB per game, which is first in the league for all players 6'2"" or shorter. Simply among point guards, Bev's rebounding ranks 5th behind Russ, Simmons, Luka, and Lonzo. It isn't just on the defensive side that Bev pulls the boards down, because his 1.2 OREB per game ranks 4th among all point guards and once again 1st among players 6'2"" or shorter.  So no Bev isn't our best, 2nd best, or even 4th best player. What he is though, is a guy who does everything asked of him at an elite level. As for your comment about ""I used to watch him so I know"", you are aware that players change and improve their game right?"
"kevin durant’s career defensive rating is lower than iverson’s. also i’d expect a player to be more efficient when the worst costar they’ve ever had is russell westbrook. iverson had to score on rosters where his best teammate was eric snow, which means much more shot attempts. also, the thunder beating the aging mavs who cleared cap space for the following offseason and played mostly veterans, the aging lakers, and the spurs is supposed to be more impressive than the sixers beating the aging pacers, the young raptors, and the downright incredible ray allen bucks? not sure how that works."
"Fisher got shat on by everyone from the sports media to fans for being too old. He got toasted by players like Aaron Brooks, Deron Williams, and Russell Westbrook, but when it counted Fisher always came through with clutch shots."
"Top 5 in assists during the 2010’s  1. Russell Westbrook- 6,462  2. Chris Paul- 6,215  3. Rajon Rondo- 5,626  4. LeBron James- 5,503  5. John Wall- 5,282"
"DLo is nowhere near a top 10 passer in the game.   Just off the top of my head, Chris Paul, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Ricky Rubio, Nikola Jokic, Spencer Dinwiddie, Malcolm Brogdon, Russell Westbrook, Ben Simmons, Lonzo, Steph, Trae Young, Kyle Lowry, etc.   That doesn't even include players I think might be better passers but because they're not the primary PGs/playmakers on their team they don't always have a chance to show it, like Tyus Jones, Elfrid Payton or Marcus Smart.   I agree they have different roles and it's obviously harder to be a number one option than 2 or 3.That being said, if DLo's your number one option your team probably isn't very good. If Jaylen Brown is your second or third option, you could still be a very very good team."

Mike D will be blamed for it then russell westbrook for some reason ala the kd russell thunder
Cause he is russell westbrook
You mean the same point guard who led both his team and the league in assists in 2019 who also made it easier for Paul George to have a career year? That Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook has entered the chat
"And Rondo still provides a higher level of BBIQ and passing than Lin ever did.  If Lakers fans hate Rondo, boy they are they in for a fucking treat if they get Lin on the team. One of the criticisms of Lin (even when he was healthy) was his tendency to barrel down the lane with little regard for what was in his way, I mean it works....if you're Russell Westbrook I guess?  Lin is a willing passer but when he attacks he gets tunnel vision and basically drives himself into cul-de-sacs which he then doesn't have the skill/explosiveness to get himself out.  Jeremy Lin as much as I love the guy, has never been a particularly high BBIQ player. He very much relied on his deadly first step to get beyond his defender, now that is mostly gone after a series of serious injuries what does he have left to threaten defenders? His jumpshot is still inconsistent so he can't punish teams from deep, his mid-range pullup has some decent percentages (40ish%) but he doesn't take many of them."
"I can see the argument for a harder PF field in all nba, but... parker went up against Jason Kidd, Steve nash, stephon Marbury, Arenas, Chris Paul, Deron Williams when he was legit amazing, Chauncey, Russell Westbrook, good rondo, MVP Derrick Rose, and later in his career steph curry, dame, kyrie, Lowry... that's a pretty nutso list.  Also parker was the best player in a number of spurs teams. I think Pau is slightly better but I'm not very confident"
"Curry, Dame, Westbrook, CP3, Fox, Simmons, Russell, Lowry, Kemba, Kyrie, Trae  (not in order)"
"I feel that's kinda double-edged. It's like when you start a business with your buddies. At first it's super cool, and chill, because they're your friends and you're all in this together.  Then, your 8AM meetings start at 11AM because everyone goofs around too much. No progress is made, money isn't coming in. You start seeing the flaws in your friends, and you decide maybe you never should have started a business with them.  I'm not saying this kind of divisive rift will happen between Karl and D'Angelo, but there's a chance it could. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were seemingly inseperable for a while, and then Durant just bounced out.   To ensure something like this doesn't happen, I think Karl Anthony-Towns and D'Angelo Russell need a third, 'bigger' piece to keep the two of them rooted. If it's all about KAT and D-Lo, and the two don't start seeing eye to eye, it might hurt the Timberwolves because there's no third option to defer to, or calm the storm."
I kind of feel like Russell westbrook is just never going to want to stop playing.
"Giannis, if he continues to dominate the regular season but lose in the playoffs for around 7 more years, until winning a chip in 2027 with an old Russell Westbrook, Eric Bledsoe, Draymond Green, and Myles Turner"
"We can feild an entire rotation just out of the current squad:  Russell Westbrook  Robert Covington  Jeff Green  Ben McLemore  Demarre Carroll  Tyson Chandler  Bruno Caboclo  Thabo Sefalosha  David Nwaba  Chris Clemons  (Harden, Gordon, Tucker, Rivers, and House are the only guys who were with us last year)"
"My favorite and least favorite thing about my favorite (non-Dallas) player...is that he's Russell Westbrook.   He's like the Nicholas Cage of basketball....you watch some games thinking how is this man not in the Hall of Fame already despite being an active player? Then you watch other games and think...how is he still in the NBA.   Love me some revenge tour, MVP year Westbrook though."
"Steph Curry, LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler, John Wall"
"Not a thunder fan, but we stan Russell Westbrook in this household"
"I'm going to make a small list of points for your brain to understand   1. Curry already proved in 3 years of college that he is a superstar and an all time great shooter despite whoever happens to be playing around him.  The fact that you say it has been ""proven"" that currys gravity is nothing without a great team tells me all I need to know about the who I'm waiting my time responding to.  No player ever does it alone except for maybe Lebron.  2.  Durant did not help curry, he helped the warriors.  Curry however really helped durant perform in the playoffs, it's right there in the statistics you can read them if you want or you can keep being annoying and uninformed.    3.  Saying that every player has gravity is like me saying J.R. smith is good at basketball... well yeah he was a professional but when you compare him to lebron james he starts to look like a child playing against adults.  This point you made is so infantile that I want the time back in my life that it took to respond to it.  4.  No shit the brilliance of one player is not enough to create a juggernaut.  Hell KD couldnt even get it done with westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka all on the same team. That's what made lebrons 2018 run so special, but then he got beat in 4 straight by an actual juggernaut... what was your point there?  Congratulations you refuted a point that nobody ever made.  5.  You know the nba is a business right?  You know that they still have to sell tickets and merchandise and attract viewers? So why the hell would curry say ""it's ok folks this is a lost season just tune in next year"".  They replaced kevin durant with deangelo fucking russell, and replaced klay thompson with... nobody, how about Iguodala???  The fact that you bought into this is laughable.  I bet you also bought it when Tristan Thompson said the East still runs through the Cavs.  They were always going to try to make the most of a lost season by getting as high of a draft pick as possible.  Or did you also believe them when they said deangelo russell was going to be a part of their future despite being a god awful fit.  I bet you also believe Wiggins is a part of their future aswell.  I you have a brain, you should probably start using it."
Russell Westbrook is the heavy metal of athleticism.
"a) Russell Westbrook definitely ain't a superstar  b) Y'all haven't won a playoff series since then either (still disappointed you guys lost that cavs series, was rooting hard for the pacers cuz that was a fun team)"
"But it probably won't be an upset.  They're 6th in the west currently.  Like, if the Rockets lose to the Nuggets first round (fingers crossed), no one would consider that a stain on his legacy.  They aren't gonna be heavy favorites no matter what their matchup is.    This would be a valid point if they were a top seed, but no one is gonna be like ""Remember when Russell Westbrook, as the 2nd best player on a 6th seeded team, didn't lead a first round upset in 2020?"" when his career is over, haha.  Like, the difference between losing in the 1st or 2nd round 1 year as a 6 seed is negligble when evaluating a career"

* Steve Nash * Russell Westbrook * Dwyane Wade * Klay Thompson * Shawn Marion * Caron Butler * Al Horford * Chris Bosh * Tyson Chandler * Dwight Howard  And the team would be:  Nash/Wade/Thompson/Bosh/Howard
You forgot Russell Westbrook
"Yeah, and so did Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Westbrook has made 4 WCF, and a Final, as the undisputed 1B to Durant's 1A, as the secondary scorer and primary playmaker on those Thunder teams. Harden has made a Final and 4 WCF as either the 3rd option or the first option. People just don't remember. That being said, it's the #1 priority of both of them to get a ring if they want to be an All Time Great without an asterisk like Malone/Iverson/Barkley."
"At the top of their Peaks.. Who are you taking?  1.)  At the top of their PEAKS.. Who are you taking?

Picking one side only, which side can you make an argument for the best starting 5 in your opinion? Who are your starting 5?  Nash, Brodie, Harden, Agent 0, Marion, Granger, Horford, Bosh, Chandler, Howard.  Taking the right side for a lineup of Kidd, Harden, Klay, Horford, and Howard."
"I mean, if you're gonna claim that a place is ""run by the Klan"", you need pretty strong evidence to support the claim that Oklahoma is somehow unique or extreme in its racism compared to so called 'nice' places. Even if it is, that doesn't mean that individuals (such as Blake Griffin and Russell Westbrook) cannot have had a genuinely positive experience there, and may not need your condescension disguised as ""empathy."" But if looking down upon places I'm 99.99% sure you've never been makes you feel better about yourself, go for it."
"I mean he seemed to enjoy Oklahoma. I suppose Russell Westbrook is also deserving of pity because he was stupid enough to also enjoy his time in shithole Oklahoma? Or maybe this is more of a problem on your end and some people genuinely enjoy playing in smaller markets rather than under the intense media scrutiny of a New York or LA? Nope, there must be something wrong with him because no one in their right mind could possibly like something different than what I like."
"I wanted to include a confidence level, because some of them were easy decisions and some of them were really fucking close. I could be swayed either way for most of these, to be honest.  * Steve Nash or Jason Kidd – Nash (confidence level: 8/10)  * Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook – Rose (4/10)  * Dwayne wade or James Harden – Wade (6/10)  * Gilbert Arenas or Klay Thompson – Arenas (8/10)  * Shawn Marion or Andre Iguoudala – Marion (9/10)  * Danny Granger or Caron Butler – Granger (9/10)  * Paul Millsap or Al Horford – Horford (6/10)  * Chris Bosh or Lamarcus Aldridge – Bosh (3/10)  * Deandre Jordan or Tyson Chandler – Jordan (5/10)  * Demarcus Cousins or Dwight Howard – Howard (9/10)   So many factors come into play though, mostly different eras and different roles. For instance if we said in their respective eras then Dwight Howard would be an easy 10/10 over Cousins, but if you take Cousins's three point shooting into account then there's a SMALL case to be made for him. As far as roles, the Warriors get worse if they replace Klay with Arenas, but prime Arenas could easily carry a team better than Klay.  ---  &gt; 2.) Picking one side only, which side can you make an argument for the best starting 5 in your opinion? Who are your starting 5?  Really tough. I think an Arenas/Wade/Marion/Millsap/Bosh lineup would be REALLY interesting, especially on defense. Marion/Millsap/Bosh can all switch between them on defense and protect the rim, and Arenas/Wade can slash and kick all day. That probably isn't the *best* lineup in terms of raw skill but it's the one I'd have the most fun watching.  On the other side, I'd probably go Harden/Klay/Iguodala/Horford/Dwight. I'm not as crazy as I should be about a Horford/Dwight frontcourt in today's game; obviously they'd be elite but they would be so much better in 2010 than in 2020."

"&gt; Companies pay “influencers” on social media millions of millions of dollars because of the reach they have.   Yes they do, but that doesn't apply to entities like a sports league which already has a sponsorship department and only use social media for further benefit of such sponsorships. These entities don't make sufficient money off social media to cover costs of maintaining their digital services.  &gt;The ability to capture markets without having people actually tune in to watch games   No it isn't, biggest source of revenue is eyeballs on matches for any sports organisation and it's not even close. Everything is primarily determined from that.  &gt;brings in tons of revenue from outside sources (merchandise, ads, sponsors, endorsements)  For thing advertisers look for is how much your league is being watched, advertisers pay for eyeballs and you are trying to argue that they want to pay for supposed fans that are not being eyeballs for the product.  &gt;Clicks per visit and click through rates are incredibly valuable online.

No, they are directly affected by viewership rates. Network partners care about how many eyeballs they will get, not about how much Russell Westbrook highlights are watched on the internet."
PG: Michael Carter Williams (ROY 2014)  SG: Russell Westbrook (2017 MVP)  SF: Andrew Wiggins (ROY 2015)  PF: Dennis Rodman (DPOY 1990)  C: Dwight Howard (DPOY 2009)  6th man: Shaquille O'Neal (MVP 2000)
"oh uhhh that’s crazy the rockets won a regular season game, the worse team out of 2 has definitely never done that. no matter how your offense is working now, it’s not going to work in the playoffs. russell westbrook is a fucking bum in the playoffs and always has been, and in the playoffs the rockets stupid gimmick basketball is going to crash and burn the second pj tucker has to guard nikola jokic"
"why are the thunder better without russell westbrook? first durant choking in the playoffs was the excuse, then it was his shitty team and bad coaching. then he had another mvp candidate teammate in paul george and they still choked twice and it was george and donovan’s fault. now he’s gone and donovan is suddenly considered good and they are BETTER with 35 year old chris paul"
Harden really about average even more than he did last season vs Golden State but will get bounced by LeBronto West because Russell Westbrook will blow it
Who needs a center when you have a Russell Westbrook
Who needs a Center when you have Russell Westbrook?
I have a question for everyone. Who is the better player this year? Not last year. Not during their peak. This year.  Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook.
"I might be a straight man, but I'm a simp for Russell Westbrook"
"Another great episode. Extremely fascinating and informative roundtable discussion by the team, and we get an extended Russell Westbrook cameo!"
"""*Why they watching me?*"" - Russell Westbrook"
are you really comparing Jason Terry to Russell Westbrook? C’mon man!
Good thing Harden doesn't either. Cause he's got Russell Westbrook
"My Team Love  Guards: Steph Curry, Luka Doncic  Forwards: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kristaps Porzingis  Center: Nikola Jokic  &amp;#x200B;  My Team Hate  Guards: James Harden, Russell Westbrook  Forwards: LeBron James, Kawhit Leonard  Center: Anthony Davis"
That's what Russell Westbrook imagines is going to happen when he throws up bricks at the end of games looking for fouls.
In 2018 Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double and literally nobody gave a shit.
Reggie Jackson went to the Russell Westbrook school of offense. Unfortunately he is not Russell Westbrook lol
Mudiay was compared to Russell Westbrook when he was drafted haha
"I personally think he's gonna just sign the supermax this offseason. Also, why do we ignore Russell Westbrook and Demar DeRozan both stayed loyal and took the bag but got traded the next year so..   Anyways, even if Giannis does leave the league will be fine. Star players have always moved around, it's part of what makes the league interesting. It didn't start with just LeBron in 2010 either."
"As a rockets fan you wont get many votes from /r/nba for them because James Harden is ""literally Hitler."" Memes aside I think they are an exciting team who spreads the ball around and has 2 of the most dominant offensive players in Harden and Russell Westbrook. Hope you enjoy the games! (Rockets first game is tomorrow vs the Mavericks, who I dislike a lot because they're a rival Texas team, but it's hard to hate on their young leader Luka Doncic, he's a beast!)"

As a [spot-up shooter](https://stats.nba.com/players/spot-up/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*paul%20george), he ranks in the 73rd percentile overall (1.09PPP). However, his most impressive work comes **off screens**: he's [one of the best in the league](https://stats.nba.com/players/off-screen/?sort=POSS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=GP*GE*30) at shooting off-of-[screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQRWozoDcsY) - he's 6th in volume, but an incredible 84th percentile in efficiency (1.13 PPP), which is better than several ""pure shooters"" like JJ Redick and Joe Harris. This elite off-ball movement and shooting are incredibly valuable, as they help him fit and scale well next to various ball-dominant superstars ranging from Kawhi Leonard to Russell Westbrook.   - 🟢 **Solid passer/playmaker**  Despite inheriting a smaller overall offensive role in LAC, PG's [Assist %]( https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/georgpa01.html#advanced::none) has actually improved from last season (17.7%➡️21.2%), setting a new career-high this season.  Underrated passer and shot creator for teammates out of PnR action, capable of throwing lobs to rolling bigs, kickouts to shooters, finding cutters with intelligent look-aways. **Numbers**: 3.9 AST/Game, 5.9 Passer Rating, 8.0 Box Creation, LAC have an excellent offense (+3.2 rORTG), which improves by +2.7 points with PG on court.   - 🟢 **Playoff P hasn't been too shabby, actually**  Despite wearing a ""choker"" playoff label from a couple of infamously awful individual playoff games in recent years and failing to get past the first round for the past 4 seasons, PG has actually turned in fairly impressive **individual** numbers. Over his past 4 playoffs, George has produced 25 points and 3.9 assists per 75 on 42.4/38.0/88.3 shooting (58.1 TS%, +3.1 rTS%) while paired with his typically stingy defense, averaging a very solid +5.0 BPM. Hopefully, an impressive showing alongside Kawhi in LA during the upcoming postseason might allow him to start repairing his offensive reputation.  - 🟢 **Excellent defender**  [This year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4eDGqq2r0), PG has still been a very decent defender. While he was a legitimate DPOY candidate last season while leading the league in steals and the Thunder to the 4th-ranked defense (-2.6 rDRTG), this season, his defensive intensity and role have both regressed slightly next to fellow elite perimeter stoppers Kawhi and Beverley.   When he's healthy and locked in, PG is one of the very best wing defenders in the league. His near 7-foot wingspan constantly shrinks the floor, weaponizing his length, speed, and footwork to poke and prod at whichever poor sod enters his steal-radius. When paired next to other elite stoppers (Roberson/Grant in OKC, or Leonard/PatBev in LAC), most offenses have a hard time finding any breathing space in the paint, and turnovers are forced aplenty. He's one of the best in the league at clogging and jumping passing lanes, but able to recover to shooters after helping with his speed and length. He's long and switchable, providing elite man-D against guards and forwards - he guards positions 1-4 at least 19% of the time each, and spends around 9% of his possessions on Cs. His length can give him *some* rim-protection - he challenges shots well without fouling. A special skill PG owns is navigating screens - he's able to 'make himself skinny' incredibly well.  Numbers: 1.3 steals/game, 0.5 blocks/game, Clippers have 5th-ranked defense (-3.2 rDRTG) which improves by 0.7 points with PG on the floor (indicating LAC's overall defensive quality but also his slight regression this season). Most available defensive metrics paint him as a solid positive on D (+0.8 to +1.8) as a Clipper.  **The not-as-good:** -  - 🔴 **Some areas of scoring**  Despite impressive overall playoff numbers, he *has* had a few rough performances in key moments of playoff rounds in recent seasons. He has also shot a relatively-inefficient 37.1 FG% in the midrange, where he takes over a fifth of his attempts. His rim-finishing has been pretty average for a forward (61.6FG% in restricted area). His free-throw rate has fallen from last year (34%➡️28%), likely due to reduced on-ball opportunities this season. His scoring efficiency in the PnR and in isolations has also regressed from last season, likely for a similar reason.  - 🔴 **Some areas of passing/playmaking**  PG isn't a high-volume creator for teammates quite yet, missing numerous creation opportunities on tape. Even at his peak in OKC, he 'only' led the team to a below-average 108 ORTG without Westbrook on the court. His PnR reads, while solid, are far from perfect - he doesn't hit skip passes often, his lobs aren't always soft, and his bounce passes aren't always spiffy.   - 🔴 **Some areas of defense**  PG's effort levels haven't been at the same feverish intensity it was at last season since returning from injury this year, and his defensive playmaking rates (steals/deflections) have fallen off a cliff (though part of this is likely due to a change in defensive role and scheme under Doc Clippers). His rim protection is still lacking overall, and he isn't capable of guarding 5s consistently. While an extremely capable reader of passing lanes, he does strike out on occasion.   - 🔴 **Durability/Injuries**  He has missed around a third of his games this season, though he's been quite solid overall during his past few seasons (81, 75, 79, 76 GP) after recovering fully from his gruesome compound fracture that he received during a Team USA showcase game in August 2014."

This elite off-ball movement and shooting are incredibly valuable, as they help him fit and scale well next to various ball-dominant superstars ranging from Kawhi Leonard to Russell Westbrook.   - 🟢 **Solid passer/playmaker**  Despite inheriting a smaller overall offensive role in LAC, PG's [Assist %]( https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/georgpa01.html#advanced::none) has actually improved from last season (17.7%➡️21.2%), setting a new career-high this season.  Underrated passer and shot creator for teammates out of PnR action, capable of throwing lobs to rolling bigs, kickouts to shooters, finding cutters with intelligent look-aways. **Numbers**: 3.9 AST/Game, 5.9 Passer Rating, 8.0 Box Creation, LAC have an excellent offense (+3.2 rORTG), which improves by +2.7 points with PG on court.   - 🟢 **Playoff P hasn't been too shabby, actually**  Despite wearing a ""choker"" playoff label from a couple of infamously awful individual playoff games in recent years and failing to get past the first round for the past 4 seasons, PG has actually turned in fairly impressive **individual** numbers. Over his past 4 playoffs, George has produced 25 points and 3.9 assists per 75 on 42.4/38.0/88.3 shooting (58.1 TS%, +3.1 rTS%) while paired with his typically stingy defense, averaging a very solid +5.0 BPM. Hopefully, an impressive showing alongside Kawhi in LA during the upcoming postseason might allow him to start repairing his offensive reputation.  - 🟢 **Excellent defender**  [This year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4eDGqq2r0), PG has still been a very decent defender. While he was a legitimate DPOY candidate last season while leading the league in steals and the Thunder to the 4th-ranked defense (-2.6 rDRTG), this season, his defensive intensity and role have both regressed slightly next to fellow elite perimeter stoppers Kawhi and Beverley.   When he's healthy and locked in, PG is one of the very best wing defenders in the league. His near 7-foot wingspan constantly shrinks the floor, weaponizing his length, speed, and footwork to poke and prod at whichever poor sod enters his steal-radius. When paired next to other elite stoppers (Roberson/Grant in OKC, or Leonard/PatBev in LAC), most offenses have a hard time finding any breathing space in the paint, and turnovers are forced aplenty. He's one of the best in the league at clogging and jumping passing lanes, but able to recover to shooters after helping with his speed and length. He's long and switchable, providing elite man-D against guards and forwards - he guards positions 1-4 at least 19% of the time each, and spends around 9% of his possessions on Cs. His length can give him *some* rim-protection - he challenges shots well without fouling. A special skill PG owns is navigating screens - he's able to 'make himself skinny' incredibly well.  Numbers: 1.3 steals/game, 0.5 blocks/game, Clippers have 5th-ranked defense (-3.2 rDRTG) which improves by 0.7 points with PG on the floor (indicating LAC's overall defensive quality but also his slight regression this season). Most available defensive metrics paint him as a solid positive on D (+0.8 to +1.8) as a Clipper.  **The not-as-good:** -  - 🔴 **Some areas of scoring**  Despite impressive overall playoff numbers, he *has* had a few rough performances in key moments of playoff rounds in recent seasons. He has also shot a relatively-inefficient 37.1 FG% in the midrange, where he takes over a fifth of his attempts. His rim-finishing has been pretty average for a forward (61.6FG% in restricted area). His free-throw rate has fallen from last year (34%➡️28%), likely due to reduced on-ball opportunities this season. His scoring efficiency in the PnR and in isolations has also regressed from last season, likely for a similar reason.  - 🔴 **Some areas of passing/playmaking**  PG isn't a high-volume creator for teammates quite yet, missing numerous creation opportunities on tape. Even at his peak in OKC, he 'only' led the team to a below-average 108 ORTG without Westbrook on the court. His PnR reads, while solid, are far from perfect - he doesn't hit skip passes often, his lobs aren't always soft, and his bounce passes aren't always spiffy.   - 🔴 **Some areas of defense**  PG's effort levels haven't been at the same feverish intensity it was at last season since returning from injury this year, and his defensive playmaking rates (steals/deflections) have fallen off a cliff (though part of this is likely due to a change in defensive role and scheme under Doc Clippers). His rim protection is still lacking overall, and he isn't capable of guarding 5s consistently. While an extremely capable reader of passing lanes, he does strike out on occasion.   - 🔴 **Durability/Injuries**  He has missed around a third of his games this season, though he's been quite solid overall during his past few seasons (81, 75, 79, 76 GP) after recovering fully from his gruesome compound fracture that he received during a Team USA showcase game in August 2014."
"Are we talking about the same Russell Westbrook? Freak-of-nature designed-in-a-laboratory bio-mechanically engineered indomitable-maniac Russell Westbrook? I think people are just kinda done being surprised by anything Russ does, good or bad."

"But your point was that number 23 was being treated differently and this post is just hating on women, and you supported that with Russell Westbrook. If he also gets trashed on for the things he says. How is number 33 being treated differently?"

"Harden was 5th at one point - Giannis 1 LeBron 2 Luka 4, and at 3rd place on NBA.com's MVP ladder...... yep, you guessed it, ... **[Kemba Walker](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/11/29/kia-mvp-ladder-nov-29-edition-2019-20)**!    ---  Edit - The NBA.com writer of that MVP ladder (Sekou Smith) got [absolutely roasted](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/12/03/kia-mvp-mailbag-dec-3) in that week's mailbag lol  &gt;Hey Sekou!   &gt;Big fan here and hoping I could get a clarification for the recent MVP ladder that was posted.  &gt;Just want to know if you actually spend time watching the NBA at all?  &gt;I think you'd find it would help when putting compiling the next MVP Ladder. Let me know if I can be of any help.  &gt;Cheers!  .   &gt;I realize you seem to value winning over anything else, but Boston is only 13-5, with only a marginally better SRS than the Rockets in a much weaker conference. Harden’s leading the 2nd best offense in the NBA with two starters injured in Green and Gordon, not to mention with co-superstar Russell Westbrook shooting a career-worst 22.5% from 3-point range.  &gt;Every advanced stat in existence has Harden as a much better player (PIPM, RAPTOR, BPM, WS/48, VORP, PER, TPA, you name it).  &gt;I could see a semblance of an argument if Kemba were anything close to a lockdown defender, but neither player is a positive defensively and it’s not even close on offense -- Harden’s lapping Kemba in scoring, efficiency, and assists, while leading an offense that’s ranked 10 positions higher.  &gt;I apologize for my harsh words, but I honestly feel that this is an affront to NBA reporting, and an insult to everything Harden’s doing to keep the Rockets competitive in an excruciatingly tight Western Conference (not to mention an insult to great seasons across the board from Tatum, Brown, Hayward, Smart, and the rest of a gritty, tough Celtics team, to insinuate that the majority of their success comes down to Kemba).   .  &gt;Dude,  &gt;You are on something. Kemba Walker in the top 5? Doncic at No. 4 while averaging a near 30-point triple-double at 20 years old in his second season? No mention of James Harden? You are just either craving to get attention or plain stupid in your rationale when making your picks. Remember, basketball is a team sport so please for goodness sakes don’t judge the player ranking on team performance ever!!! If that was true, Bill Russell is then greatest of all time. Which we both know as great as he was (undeniably), he is just not GOAT. Stop the lunacy, homie, and go based on numbers like anyone else does in business.  .  &gt;First of all, I really enjoy your weekly MVP ladders so keep up with the good work.  &gt;However, it is really hard for me to agree with Kemba Walker being above Luka Dončič in the MVP race.  &gt;The Celtics are 13-5 in an easier Eastern Conference, while Dallas Mavericks are 11-6 (I don't count the Suns game here tonight, where Luka torched them again), so record-wise they are on a similar level. Kemba has a slightly better supporting cast in my opinion until Porzingis gets to full flight in Dallas.  &gt;If we look at sheer head-to-head stats, it's not even close:  &gt;Doncic is averaging approximately 30 ppg, 10 rpg and 10 apg on 30-10-10 on 48% shooting, while Walker is at approximately 22 ppg, 5 rpg and 5 apg on 41% shooting.  &gt;No amount of defense (which Luka improved drastically in the past few games and still a long way to go though) can negate the absolute Grand Canyon of a statistical gap between these two players.  &gt;Looking forward to your counter-argument, as I can't really find one.  &gt;P.S.: I understand numbers don't tell the whole story, but the difference here is just mind-boggling.  .  &gt;Luka Is playing better than anybody in the league right now -- you can’t argue that and there is no disputing it. Putting Walker above him in the No. 3 spot just makes it look like you have some type of an agenda you are attempting to promote."
"Moses Malone is definitely up there, a lot of people just don’t know how good he was, the same goes for a lot of older players especially, who are just simply unknown to the average fan, and the lack of game footage plays a role in that   For example, I think if a lot of people had watched the 60s nba, there would be a general understanding that Bill Russell is better than Wilt Chamberlain, because he is, but people are too fixated on stats.   That’s my fear about what is going to happen with Russell Westbrook, in 20-30+ years he’ll be considered a lot higher on the all times player list than he actually deserves  But to directly answer your question, I’d probably say Dominic Wilkins and Alex English"
"You are equating most assists as the best passer the same way you are equating the most points as the best scorer.   Russell Westbrook lead the league in APG for 2 years. No one really considered him to be the best passer in the league those years though. Guys like CP3 and LeBron are considered to be better passers.  Russ averaged 10+ assists for 4 seasons, LeBron has only averaged above 9 twice but is definitely seen as the better passer.   Most volume does not equal the best.   You're comparing Wilt's games with 10+ assists to Jokic. Seriously? Wilt played 15 seasons. Jokic is in his fifth.   Most importantly, pace plays in Wilt's favour with the volume of his numbers (as you can see in the original post). He was also a stat padder."
"those numbers are mvp numbers some years but not this year.  russell wasnt better in those 34 games than giannis, lebron, kawhi, harden, luka.    19 bad games along with Missing 10 games in a shortened season is a bigger deal too.  Would you really without a thought give all-nba to a guy who played the first 22 games like an arguable net negative, missed   13 more and then played the rest of the season like a top 10 player when all-nba only goes 15 deep.  Edit: and the impact stuff matters now.  westbrook was actually underrated in some previous years impact wise like 2017.  this year rpm is the only one he's top 10 in.  pipm and raptor are both around neutral."
"Have you ever seen Russell Westbrook interact with a media member, for instance? Athletes take mundane shit as disrespect ALL THE TIME. If you personally find Russ cringey then alright I guess but it's not abnormal and this whole thread is just hating on this woman."
"I take it you're not a fan of guys like Russell Westbrook and Michael Jordan then. I know Jordan was the best player like you said, but you better bet when he was just some dude in high school he took looking at him the wrong way as disrespect. It's how a lot of athletes stay motivated, don't get it twisted just because you don't respect female athletes."
What forwards are needing spots to push guys like Beal and Russell Westbrook out? It's been so long since the season and I wasn't really watching as much this year so I need a refresher.  edit: Ben Simmons and Middleton made it over Beal and Russ? Lol.
"Since he's been with Houston, he's had Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Chandler Parsons, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, Robert Covington, Clint Capela, Jeremy Lin, Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza, Lou Williams, and Ryan Anderson, all of whom were considered starter-level at worst during their time in Houston. He's had plenty of support. Just had to play against the Warriors every year."

"I’m sorry, is your argument that Ben McLemore, who has generally not been a very good player in his career, is more valuable to the Rockets than Russell Westbrook?"
"Russell Westbrook, are we gonna get first or second half of the season Westbrook?"
Russell Westbrook
That OKC team wasn’t “stacked.” Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were each 22 years old and 21 year old James Harden averaged 12.2 PPG that season.
The Russell Westbrook disrespect is insane. Take Ben or Tatum off and give it to him. Or take Pascal off and give it to Westbrook.
"&gt; Tell me a player thats dropped 40+ all in wins against us, the clippers, and the celtics. Three of the top 5-6 teams in the league. Russ has been spectacular this year and its pathetic to see people like lowe critique his efforts all because ""harden getting double teamed allows russ to play 4 on 3 lol.  Why do you take this as me *agreeing* with Lowe? I don't, at all  My only point is just because we disagree about stats, doesn't mean I have to make it out like he has some personal vendetta against Russell Westbrook"
"I haven't thought about who to put in there. Russell Westbrook was awful the whole first half of the season, then was awesome the second half.   I think i would go with Ben Simmons (might be controversial), but his defense has been insane consistently through the whole season.    Yes Lowry is better offensively than Ben Simmons, but the defense Simmons has played this year has been out of this world"
"Yup, in the same podcast someone, I think Windy, referred to it as ""the fun max"". It's that first max contract a player can get right after their rookie extension, where they're young and in their prime for the duration of the contract and it's a lower %. The player gets paid, the team gets a good player at a decent number, everyone is happy, the fun max.  The second max contract is where things get scary, where the numbers are higher and you also may have some question marks about the last couple of years on the back end of the contract. That's where you get $47m for a 33 year old Russell Westbrook, or $54,250,000 for a 34 year old Damian Lillard. These maxes are not so fun.  But paying like $33m a year for 4 years of Bam Adebayo at 24-27 years old? Hell yeah! Fun max.  Just don't ask me about Andrew Wiggins' contract tho LOL."
"sheesh, Sonics-Thunder org. :  Jack Sikma     Shawn Kemp // Serge Ibaka   Scottie Pippin // Kevin Durant   Dennis Johnson // James Harden   Gary Payton // Russell Westbrook"

Russell Westbrook is hella smart tho. I forgot what his GPA was. I think around 4.0
"Russell Westbrook: “Pat Bev trick y’all, man, like he sayin something. He don’t say nothin, man. He just running his mouth, sayin nothing.” Made sure to note that JJ Reddick had to get Pat Bev back on topic 47 times tonight."

"&gt; Tucker will guard AD well, but AD will still do his thing, last time he scored 30pts, we can let him do that for a series.  “Let”  &gt;Also, who is guarding Russell Westbrook? 42 and 6 in the previous fixture.  KCP. Bradley was getting abused in that last matchup  &gt;Either way I wanna see this series  I want to see their inconsistent shooting and average at best defense try to beat the Lakers"
"Tucker will guard AD well, but AD will still do his thing, last time he scored 30pts, we can let him do that for a series.  Also, who is guarding Russell Westbrook? 42 and 6 in the previous fixture.  Either way I wanna see this series"

"1. Rob Gronkowski= Shaq.   Big goofy guys who were super dominant on the court/field. They’re in a bunch of ads and sponsorships. All time greats at their position, played in a dynasty   2. Cam Newton= Russell Westbrook.   The *most* physically dominant players ever at their position. Both won an MVP and lost a finals. Both haven’t been as good as their MVP year. Both dress pretty weird   3. Patrick Mahomes= Larry Bird   Was an MVP caliber player from the moment they were 23. Both won a ring in their 2nd year. Both were visibly among the most talented to play their position from day 1.   4. Antonio Brown= Dennis Rodman   Extremely physically talented. Both set records at their postions. Both had excellent work ethic and were tough players. Both were completely off the rails in their personal lives. There’s not a single story about either of them that’s too far-fetched to be believed.   5. Eli Manning= Isiah Thomas  Won 2 rings as the leader of a good team and beat teams that were way better. Both of them upset the GOAT. Both of them were solid players but never once the best at their position. Both of them don’t have regular season accolades like an MVP"
2. Russell Westbrook
russell westbrook is the #1 example. He doesn't have the worst iq in the world but way too many times he makes incredibly boneheaded plays. He is great already but he could be even better.  Javale mcgee in his early years.
Cp3 for Russell westbrook
"&gt;My opinion is that Gobert should be ahead of Jokic and that leaving Westbrook out is completely understandable.  I respectfully disagree with Rudy Gobert over Nikola Jokić. Jokić should be ahead Gobert when it comes to the All-NBA Second Team since I think his offensive production is more valuable over Gobert's defense, but like you said, that's your opinion, which is absolutely fine.  And yeah, I wasn't really disagreeing with Russell Westbrook being left out of an All-NBA Team, I was just kind of surprised, that's all. The first half of his season was pretty rough. His second half of the season was much better, especially after the Clint Capela trade. I don't know how much the All-NBA voters will knock off of Trae Young since he's a complete liability on defense. His numbers are off the charts though, which is what matters most I guess lol"
"Nikola Jokić should be ahead of Rudy Gobert when it comes to the All-NBA Second Team.  I'm kind of surprised to not see Russell Westbrook on any All-NBA Team.  With respect to Brook Lopez as a defender, he shouldn't be ranked ahead of Anthony Davis on the Defensive Player of the Year ballot in my opinion lol"

"There's basically 3 contributing factors to Trae grading out as the worst defender.  1. He's bad at defense. Too often he reacts slowly to what the offense is doing or is not putting in the effort to impact the game on defense.   2. The rest of the team is bad on defense. You could argue Hunter played solid D all season and JC, while at the 4, played solid D. JC got put as a small ball 5 a lot of the time, and it just did not work; if anything, he should be getting used more as like a big ball 3. Hopefully this point gets remedied by the 6 guys under 22 getting better along with Capela and Dedmon offering rim protection that the Hawks were missing all season.  3. The rest of the team is bad on offense, making is so Trae has to do that much more to even get the offense to the point of being respectable. Like I mentioned in point 1, there's an effort issue with him, but we see this with guys all the time where they get an expanded role on offense and their effort on defense suffers. It happened to Siakim this year, it happened to Westbrook a few years back.  All that said, I think Trae's defense can get to the point of like D'Angelo Russell or Kemba Walker where he's still bad on defense but nobody cares that much because of his impact on offense and the rest of the team's ability to cover for him on defense."

"I’m sorry but I think that’s exactly what I said. I’m not saying you’re wrong because in 99% of scenarios you’re right, it’s just that Russell Westbrook is the exception and it has made his teams much better in transition"
"Yeah I understood it when I was in middle school too cause that’s how you’re supposed to play in middle school. But the nba isn’t middle school. Most of the things you learned playing basketball in middle school is not applicable at all to the nba and especially not applicable to one of the 15 best basketball players in the world  I’m glad your brother understands a pass is faster than the dribble! That’ll do him well in high school, good passers in high school basketball are invaluable cause there’s just not a lot of them. But if your brother was a Russell westbrook type athlete then you should be telling him to get that freaking ball at all costs and just go"
"Nah I’m sorry bro but that’s just not true at all. A lot of nba teams are using this strategy of having their best/most explosive athlete and best ball handler crash the defensive boards hard. Most of the time it’s just a much more effective way to get the ball up the floor.  In an ideal world where centers are perfect passers and defenses get back immediately in transition then yeah it’d be faster to get the ball up the floor with an outlet but that’s not the case. Often times it takes a few seconds to find the outlet and even then the point guard will have to come back to the ball to make sure they get a safe pass and that takes precious seconds.  It’s also much easier to outlet to the sidelines than it is to the middle. But it’s very easy to get to the middle of the floor without an outlet pass and that’s where most teams want to get the ball in transition  I see what you’re saying and there’s only a select few players who you want getting the defensive rebound and just running, but Russell Westbrook is absolutely one of them. Giannis, lebron, siakam, some others I’m forgetting all do this"
Cause it’s true in middle school. Not with Russell Westbrook.   With really good ball handlers and athletes you want the ball in their hands as soon as possible. Defensive rebound is the easiest way to do that
I don’t typically root for Russell Westbrook. But i am rooting for him

Ask Russell Westbrook
Lillard will be widely considered the best point guard in the NBA within 2 years.   DeMar Derozan will be out of the NBA in 3 years if he doesn't develop a 3 point shot.  Russell Westbrook will finish his career without ever having played point guard a day in his life.
"Its nbd I just think the metrics all clearly favor Schroeder, his team is more dependent on him. Also Harrell had his usual gap in productiveness when Lou Will was on the court vs off he’s just real dependent on their pick and roll chemistry. Think Harrells reputation might be helping him a little   Yeah I know he said for all nba he had Chris Paul on his 2nd team means Luka Dame Harden Chris for first two teams and some real good guards gonna get left off 3rd team then. Devin Booker Ben Simmons Russell Westbrook might be the 3 it comes down to"
Rabid Ballsdeep Laker fans do be like that. You ask me how far can their heads be in their asses? They probably think they can trade Jordan Clarkson for Russell Westbrook.
"...did you take a cuckold picture of Russell Westbrook, your GF, and you ""cleaning her up""?"
"He definitely has an argument over Harden. Luka dropped 41 10 and 6 on Harden's head in 34 minutes. Leading the Mav's, a lottery team last year, to the playoffs with a historically efficient offense. Also, Mavs are only 3 games behind the Rockets when Luka's second best player is a player coming off of a year long injury while Harden's is Russell freakin Westbrook. Not saying you must agree that it's true but there is a definite argument there."
"Could Russell Westbrook average a triple double if the average pace was 20+ possessions faster, yes he could."
"Russell Westbrook would have been the GOAT   He’s extremely athletic and really really fast. He’d be the best player physically outside of Wilt   Back then, they played at the highest pace ever, which would be perfect for him.   His biggest weakness is his shooting. In a time before analytics or the 3-point line, the world would be his oyster"
"I would think so, it's a different style of play, Oscar used to put his back to the basket a lot even backing up on the perimeter. He would have more hops and athleticism than the rest. If he's put in the position to carry a team, even more so would his stats be up. If he has to play with Wilt, he would get less points and rebounds, but maybe more assists. I mean if he played with Wilt, he could of probably beat Russell, the other Russell because Wilt could use a guy like Westbrook as a teammate."
"Yeah he's on mine. This is how mine is.  1. Magic. 2. Stockton 3. Big O 4. Isaiah Thomas 5. Steph 6. Gary Payton 7. Steve Nash 8. Jason Kidd 9. Chris Paul  10. Russell Westbrook (if u count Jerry West as a sg and not a pg, otherwise he's number 10)"
"k listen up you little shit  I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
&gt; Am I saying he’s gonna be Ray Allen?   Let's work on getting to Russell Westbrook first before we worry about Ray Allen.
Russell Westbrook about to be steph curry
Wilt was top 2 in rebounds his entire career and is the alltime leader it's not fair to compare him to Russell westbrook there.
"Great post! I do think you gloss over Harden's dip in production. [While Harden's usage has dipped](https://stats.nba.com/articles/russell-westbrook-and-the-small-ball-rockets/), the change isn't very significant. I think the real reason for his decrease in ppg is that Harden has become less efficient. His 3p% before the change was around 36% and I think his FG% and TS% have dipped too. I'm going to take a look at the numbers and I'll update this post when I look through them.   I'm hoping he was just a bit gassed and that this break allowed him to rest up. But another theory I've read (and somewhat believe) is that taking away his lob threat in Capela has really limited his scoring options and makes him more predictable.   Personally, I miss seeing him drive in the lane and make that split second decision between throwing up a lob or taking it to the rim himself. Maybe the Rockets will start using Jeff Green in this role? I know that he's pretty old but MDA (or was it Morey?) recently described him as their ""vertical spacer.""  **EDIT:** Capela was injured on 1/29/2020, so I'm using that as the ""before and after"" date to calculate stats rather than the date Capela was traded.  |               | Games | Minutes | FGA  | FGM  | FG%   | 3PA  | 3PM | 3P%   | PTS  | |---------------|-------|---------|------|------|-------|------|-----|-------|------| | Before Injury | 44    | 37.1    | 23.6 | 10.3 | 43.6% | 12.9 | 4.6 | 35.5% | 35.7 | | After Injury  | 17    | 35.9    | 20.5 | 8.9  | 43.3% | 11.8 | 4.1 | 34.5% | 31   |  Seems like I was wrong! Probably because of recency bias since the Rockets generally played poorly the last few games before corona hit. So hopefully this means Harden was just tired/off rather than his production taking a hit because of the lack of a true center."
"OKC is kind of a messed up story.  It used to be the Sonics.  A guy from OKC bought the team from the owner of Starbucks promising to keep the team in Seattle.  He pretty quickly drove the team into the ground and fans stopped showing up because they were really bad.  He asked the Seattle City Council for money to renovate the arena/build a new one and they said no.  Using that as a pretext, he moved the team to OKC.    They've been very good, but kinda cursed.  For a little while they had 3 future MVPs in Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden.  They traded away James Harden in a really bad trade.  Kevin Durant left in free agency to join a team that was already the best in the league (Golden State), and Westbrook asked for a trade to join Harden in Houston after OKC got embarrassed in the first round against Portland last year and his co-star, Paul George, had already demanded a trade to the Clippers to play with Kawhi Leonard."

Just in time for Russell Westbrook day too
"I am amazed that people are taking your comment seriously and saying -  ""Russell Westbrook isn't a true center""  \- unironically.  r/NBA - Where Amazing Happens"
On Russell Westbrook day too!
"Same KD, the 13/16 just had to play with a line up where Russell Westbrook was the second best 3pts shooter for most of a time in the starting line up(Ibaka didn't shoot enough 3's for defenses to care).  He also mostly had to play with a center who couldn't dribble, shoot, pass or catch a ball (Perkins), that didn't help I'm sure lol"
Ja - Allen Iverson (athleticism) / Russell Westbrook (passing)  JJJ - Kevin Garnett (defense) / Karl Anthony towns (shooting)
"The Rockets already have a center, his name is Russell Westbrook"
Steven Adams and Russell Westbrook
[Seems like an accurate sample size](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/russell-westbrook-injury-update-rockets-star-out-with-strained-quad-to-be-reevaluated-before-playoffs/)
"My favourite from Russell Westbrook : Tobias, get the fuck outta the way (whilst he was filming Mattisse playing that bean bag throwing game)"
"As an OKC fan, I can't decide if this is A NO-WIN, or a NO-LOSE series.  On the one hand, either the Thunder gets sent home, or we tearfully reply, ""Yes, I am,"" when Russell ""G-money"" Westbrook inquires about his brother's keeper.  On the other hand, this guarantees one of these two squads gets to round two. There, they either get the chance to knock off the Lakers, or end some Cinderella's dance."
"Somehow a wild narrative started that implies Damian Lillard gets a lot of calls in his favor. Or takes a disproportionate amount of free throws. Ladies and gentlemen, the data is out there.  Basketball Reference has this cool advanced stat called FTr or Free Throw Attempt Rate. It's how many free throws a player takes per Field Goal Attempt. It's a good judge of how often a player is able to draw fouls in the offense.  Obviously the higher this number the more free throws they attempt per shot they take. Though it might be somewhat skewed for players that are very good FT shooters and take all the technical FTs for their team. That would make it seem they get the whistle a bit more than they actual do.  Anyway...Here's some popular players career FTr:  * James Harden: .527 * Giannis Antetokounmpo : .479 * Luka Doncic: .428 * Lebron James: .407 * Russell Westbrook: .377 * Damian Lillard: .332  What can I say about Harden? He's shooting over 1 free throw for every 2 shots. That's exciting basketball.  Poor Luka Doncic seems to be getting to the line pretty regularly, especially for being a second year player.  Lebron fans are always saying how he just doesn't get the whistle, and it might be true with how often he drives the ball vs taking uncontested jumpers. But this shows that at least among this group he's pretty average at getting to the line.  Dame on the other hand sure seems to be taking very few free throws per shots attempted. Seems the whistle isn't blowing as often as some would lead you to believe."

"Can't change the headline like that duder this thread will get deleted shortly.

Next question - Russell Westbrook
"Paul George, Russell Westbrook and others liked this"
"We literally are watching Russell Westbrook and James Harden share the ball together. Why are people still going on with this “there’s only one ball” narrative.   Ingram and Zion work.  Lonzo, Ingram, and Zion work.   Jrue Holiday is the odd man out because that’s a third ball dominant player. And the biggest issue with the Pelicans is Favors   Ingram Zion works.  Ingram Zion and Favors does not   Two rim runners affects Ingram’s midrange and at the rim scoring."
"Yeah, and that extra cushion was called Russell Westbrook"
"Keldon Johnson, a rookie, selected 29 in the draft is guarding Russell fuckin Westbrook  I like that Pop is trusting our young guys more"
"I think there is a much larger error there and that error was not correctly identifying who Russell Westbrook really was.   I believe in my heart of hearts there are several progressive organizations that would have said seeya Russ if forced to choose in that scenario. Presti has been an amazing GM, that was just a major misread."
The Russell Westbrook special
&gt;two all stars  1. Kyrie who was a terrible cultural fit and barely even a positive for the team in the playoffs  2. Old Al Horford who is a solid player but no longer an all-star at all  Compare that to Paul George who was 3rd in MVP voting last season and Russell Westbrook who was MVP only a few years ago and both are still in their primes.

So you’re saying he would like Steve Nash over Russell Westbrook?
"I like Russell Westbrook as a player. Love his hustle and fearlessness. But if you can’t see that Russell’s ball hogging inefficient chucking is what chased KD out of town then there’s really no point in debating with you. If Russell was the player you say he was, it would’ve taken a much better package to trade for him than what the rockets gave up. There weren’t teams lined up at the door, Russ was damaged goods."
"It's for the pick and I don't think anyone in the Thunder organization really wants  to play Westbrook first round.  My thoughts as a long time OKC fan -  Hou 1st round - ughhh doesn't feel great (if we win we knocked out Russell, if we lose we lost). Yes, OKC is rooting for Russell though OKC comes first; we don't want Russell 1st round.  Hou 2nd round or later - Ok, we will do what we must. Let's all play a good series. Our only friend on the court is ""spalding"""

I haven't heard a single reasonable person saying that he had better potential than Fox. Fox has John Wall/Russell Westbrook level ceiling. The best case scenario for Dejounte is to be the best guard defender in the league plus a 16 PPG combo guard on good efficiency. He can be a fine 2nd or 3rd piece on a title team. That's about it. I just think that the year lost to the ACL injury really hindered his development.
Most plays the rockets have involve swinging the ball around the 3 point line and drive and dishes with Russell Westbrook. The only reason small ball works is because the rockets have 5 shooters on the court that they use frequently.
"Hehe, whoops... just read the title and I kinda forgot some things  Meant to be: ""MVP Talk consideration: How valuable is Anthony Davis to the Lakers, Khris Middleton **to the Bucks**, Russell Westbrook **to the Rockets**""  I'll repost"
How valuable is Anthony Davis to Khris Middleton and Russell Westbrook?
"Case studies don't support this idea. Steph Curry, James Harden, Lebron James, Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, literally every single modern player I could think to compare Trae to sees their counting stats and advanced stats drop when paired with higher usage teammates. Trae is undeniably great offensively, but I'm so fucking tired of hearing people repeat 30 and 10 when it says more about his usage than value and also completely ignores his massive deficiency on defense."
"24.8 PPG on 40 FG% is horrible for any player on Damian Lillards level. If you don’t think that’s bad, you’re either too biased to have the conversation, or you don’t hold Damian Lillard to the standards he should be held to.  FWIW “inefficient playoff choker” Russell Westbrook averages 25 PPG on 41 FG% for his career in the playoffs.    Once again, Damian Lillard gets a pass for playing below his standards. Classic 😂"
"Literally nothing about this comment is accurate.  &gt;PG snaked them  PG didn’t snake them. He requested a trade away from a roster that was going absolutely fucking nowhere, and he was absolutely right in doing so. That team wasn’t doing shit.   &gt;they got better by getting rid of him  You’re delusional if you think Paul George not being there is the reason they’re as good as last season (not even better). Let’s completely ignore the fact that they got rid of one of the most inefficient scorers in the entire league in Russell Westbrook.  You don’t understand basketball."
"Seriously, this is colossally dumb.   Might as well say you hate when people have Russell Westbrook in their top 10 all time, since there’s just as many people who say that."
"Klay Thompson has been overrated since the 2012-13 season (his sophomore season). It's just that how overrated he is varies year by year.   Russell Westbrook fans really play up the media ""hate"". It's not hate to leave the 2nd best (with no argument for best) player on a middle of the road playoff team off All-NBA teams. Especially when it's an extremely stacked era for guards."
"Chris Paul won't be seen as highly as he currently is, he's getting a boost in what he actually does as a player because he's in the twilight of his career and people wax poetic over guys who are going to start falling off.  I'd be as bold to state that not only will in twenty years Russell Westbrook will be seen as the better player overall, but that CP3 won't be seen as a Top Ten Point Guard All Time because I'd put him at 8 right now, and in the next twenty years a few players could come along and bump him out of the Top Ten."
Better triple-double performances than Russell Westbrook? Genuine question
Didn’t Russell Westbrook clinch the season-long triple double average on the last night of the 2016 season too? Or am I getting things mixed up?
Neither has made it to the Finals. Give me Russell Westbrook.
"Russell Westbrook, he's just the worst."
"If Chris Webber and Ben Wallace are not in the Hall of Fame there is no way Kyle Lowry makes it. An All-Star appearance in the East is way less valuable than an All-Star appearance in the West. How many All-Star appearances do you think Kyle Lowry would have if he had to compete with Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, James Harden, and Damian Lillard for those spots?   Not trying to hate on Kyle Lowry but I think there is definitely a less than 50% he makes it."
"Bro your flair is Russell Westbrook, I can tell why you think that"
"Eric Bledsoe, Russell Westbrook, Giannis"
"I've seen people say russ is not a top 50 player in the league and tried to make actual cases for it.   This year the hate has calmed down some but I've never seen a player more hated on this sub specifically than russell westbrook during his MVP year.  I've never seen a person do so well and not get an ounce of credit for it, on this sub specifically."
"The sophomore leap hardly ever happens like this.  Find people who made the leap Luka made.  He’s in the company of Shaq, KD, Lebron - players who seriously stepped their game up in year 2.  Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Brandon Ingram,  Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Lonzo, D’Angelo Russell, Kristaps Porzingis, Andrew Wiggins, John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, James Harden, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, etc were all picked early and none of them took this type of jump.  It’s not normal."
"But I think everybody tends to adjust.  If you watch interviews... It is ridiculous.  When Wilt spoke, his era was the best and he could be able to score 60 in the 90s (you have the interview on YouTube)  Bill Russell telling he would dominate Shaq by making him run and killing his stamina.  When you hear Stephen Jackson, K Mart, Tracy... Their days are the most difficult days. The most competitive days.  If you hear about the 80s... Lakers, Celtics, 76ers, Jordan, Malone, Stockton, Bird, The Bad Boys...  Every generation thinks theirs is the best.  And it happens the same with fans.  I grew up with the 2000s basketball but I am not blind enough to recognize that today, even the worse starter can get buckets. You have 7 footers shooting 3s or Guards like Westbrook and Luka averaging 10 rebounds per game.  I know thw pace is different. Everything is.  But the amount of size, muscle, talent, defensive schemes, health... Today, is 10 times better than 20 years ago, and way better than 40 years ago"
"*Russell Westbrook punching the air right now*  So funny Pav Bev riles Dame to talk trash, but Russ can't"
"People who call random players top 10 never list out their actual Top 10 lists. You basically have to decide that Brown is better than any or all of: Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, Dame Lillard, Jokic, Anthony Davis...etc. Because that's my 6-11 in some order, and that probably leaves somebody out. My top 5 are Giannis, Steph, Harden, Lebron and Kawhi in some order.  Spoiler alert, he's not even close yet. In 3 years will he and Tatum be in that class? Maybe. But not now, and probably not next year either."
"Think he’s closer to 15.  I wouldn’t take him over Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Kyrie, CP3, Lowry, Kemba, Trae, Simmons, Luka for sure.  Then there’s guys like Ja, Bledsoe, Murray, FVV that you can argue have been better this season or past all stars like Russell. I think he’s somewhere between 11-15 but I’d have a hard time knocking any of those guys out the top 10."
"I mean, it depends on what the rest of the team looks like.  [Kawhi and Siakam were one of the highest-scoring pairings in the playoff history last year](https://np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/c0h0fj/kawhi_leonard_and_pascal_siakam_combined_for_1187/).   That was with Siakam only averaging ~19ppg. Jaylen is more than capable of doing that right now.  * Can Jaylen be the #2 next to a #1 like Tatum?    I think they need more time.  * Can Jaylen be the #2 next to an in-prime Kawhi/LeBron/etc level #1?   Yeah probably, as long as there's some good backup options as well (such as Lowry, FVV, etc)  Jaylen right now can do what Siakam was doing last year. Pretty comfortably too I'd say.   Hell, we saw him average 18-20 (depending on whether you count his injured game) two years ago as a 1A/1B on a team that got within 1 game of the finals.  It depends on the roster.   Jaylen couldn't replace Russell Westbrook as the #2 in Houston for example."

"Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul are much better playmakers than Harden despite the assist numbers. That's exactly what I'm saying. His assist numbers don't represent his passing and playmaking skills, which is the point of this question.   Harden does throw good lobs off the P&amp;R. That's one type of play he's good at setting up. But overall he does not have the same passing and playmaking skills as the the great PGs you're comparing him to. That's my point."
"Yeah. Joakim Noah is really worried about his impact on the three minutes a game he gets. I get you're point. I don't expect Russell Westbrook to try the shit. But plenty of bums get time in a blowout. Unfortunately, you are more worried about being right then trying to understand the other point of view. No worries"
"But there was, there are plenty of examples online of Adams just allowing Westbrook to grab the rebound or Westbrook refusing to take an open shot just to try and get it to a teammate to get an assist. These are obviously not even genuine either. Now your probably gonna say that those aren’t representative of his play as a whole and I would agree but the fact that compilations like that even exist is clear indicative of a player who is chasing stats on some level. It’s clearly indicative of a player that is chasing the triple double. Just FYI I watched a ton of the thunder as well, more than enough to form a legit opinion   Well you’re right i dont know exactly what goes on behind closed doors, all i can tell you is what i see on the court and what the stats themselves say. westbrook has never bought in to a system with lots of ball and player movement. In fact both scott brooks and Billy Donovan went on to coach much more efficient offences with more ball and player movement since leaving OKC. Durant also has an issue with buy in, the only season where he clearly did buy in was his first season with GSW. After that he became less and less willing to exist in steve kerrs motion offense. It could also be that Durant doesn’t respect Donovan but that doesn’t mean Donovan was a bad coach. Durant is the same guy that got to Brooklyn and then all of a sudden kenny atkinson is gone.(soon after a report comes out stating players wanted him gone with the most likely culprits being KD and Kyrie)   Your acting like PG13 was some rookie, that dude was a perennial top 10 player in the league and for the most part he was better than Westbrook in that Utah series. I don’t think its a good idea to use that Jazz series as an example considering Westbrook didn’t play well either. Like I said Westbrook was willing to give the ball up but it’s clear that he let PG13 be the 1st option after he resigned which was not the case before. Its clear that he was more willing to share ball handing responsibilities in a way that he wasn’t before. This is clear indicated by a 4 point jump in usage between 18 and 19 for PG13 and 2 point decline in usage for Westbrook in the same time period.   Now 32 % usage is still extremely high when you have a top 10 player next to you but considering his usage from the previous season was 40%( which is ridiculous) It looks good in comparison. But 32% usage is still extremely high, that’s higher than 2018 Lebron( who played on a team where he had to do everything).  We’ll obviously his job is to score but how is getting his points? Teams are leaving him to try and force the ball out of hardens hands. This is why you might see Draymond Green playing free safety off of russ during the Christmas day game or miami putting Bam Adebayo on him. Hes been punishing it fairly well but it is happening: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0XJ-2BK1cus  The rockets offensive system is predicated on ISO basketball where 4 guys spread the floor while harden isos out top. Everyone knows the rockets offense does not get a ton of offball movement because of this. So how could russell possibly be cutting and moving a ton off the ball when this literally goes against the Houston rockets offensive philosophy? No Westbrook in the rockets offense simply attacks off the catch when harden get the ball to him and this is a big reason life is a lot easier in Houston in conjunction with the better floor spacing. I never said russ didn’t play-make.   the issues with that thunder team weren’t all about melo, there was plenty of blame to go around. Also there are tons of teams that suffer injuries yet still maintain seeding. Portland lost Nurkic and had to play Enes Kanter at the 5 yet they were still a 3 seed. The rockets were missing CP3 for a large chunk of the season and were still a 4 seed with a 53-29 record. Hell OKC finished the season going 7-3 of their last 10 that year so its not like PG13s injury was preventing them from winning games against the average NBA team. This wasn’t like a lebron on the lakers type of situation where he went down and the team collapsed.  Like I said it shouldn’t even be that close, an okc team that lost two franchise players shouldn’t even be in the same caliber as the team that had those players. Sure technically they were better before but it’s pretty close.   Im sure they were hurt but the reason they lost that series was due to poor spacing, awful shot selection and terrible efficiency from Westbrook. And Westbrook was having huge efficiency issues all through out the season so we cant 100% blame the injury  While true, this is now the second time that a coach who departed from Westbrook went on to have great success coaching another squad. It doesn’t really make sense that Billy Donovan wouldnt try to emphasize team oriented ball in the Westbrook day’s especially with his reputation. You can say its just coincidence that he just now figured out how to run a legit offensive system conveniently the very same season that Westbrook left. But considering that he was being flamed relentlessly the past few seasons  and had fans calling for him to be fired only for him to win COTY the exact same season Westbrook leaves is just a little eye opening to me.   Westbrooks adjustments were to handle the ball less and to be a little more willing to share the ball. However his time of possession was still very high compared to what CP3s is now, we even saw Westbrook boast a 40% usage rate the one season where he had no all stars beside him. Now with CP3 in the exact same position you see a dramatic difference.  Well its just entertainment, i find a lot of what you said to be misinformation but i wouldn’t insult you or be rude because there’s absolutely no reason to do so."
"You Westbrook lovers are something else. There is zero chance Westbrook ever wins a title unless he dramatically changes and becomes an actual point guard or moves to the 2.   Basketball is a zero sum game. You want to maximize your shot attempts that get a high rate of return. Every Westbrook shot is statistically a bad one because it comes at the expense of a better shot/better shooter. Lowest IQ player in the league.   When you go for a coding interview they quiz you to see if you know anything about coding. I have a similar one for talking basketball. If I say what's the first thing that comes to mind when when I say Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook and you don't immediately respond with something like ""2 all-time greats and Russell Westbrook"" then its clear you don't understand team and how it relates to basketball."
I'd like to think Russell Westbrook gave almost everyone on the thunder his powers with all the bricks they had against the Grizzlies.
"I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"

"That's my dude. Team leader, etc.  Is he really the best PG in the league? No. That's part of fandom though, I'm sure you'd say that Russell Westbrook is #3 in the league right now because you are a fan :)"
"What's it worth exactly? Did it guarantee contention? Or anything close?   Can you imagine adding one of the 10 best players in the game to Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, or Giannis's roster for next season? Without even knowing the particulars you would think shit the league is in trouble. Harden is unquestionably in that same group. Were the Rockets playing like a team that was going to win 65? Or anything remotely close to that?   People need to stop acting like Westbrooks numbers pass the smell test, or that the advanced numbers are wrong. Greatness plus greatness usually equals greatness. Like another pair of top 10 players that were teamed together this year, for example.   Russell Westbrook is a beautiful sports car - with no breaks, no GPS, and no steering wheel. Looks way better than it drives lol."
6'2 point center Russell Westbrook
"Why?  He'd do for us what he did for Charlotte, another garbage team with a dumbass owner (sorry Hornets fans)- make us just good enough to get a shitty pick every year.  I really like him as a player but he's making almost Chris Paul/Russell Westbrook money, and he's also an undersized guard about to turn 30.  It makes sense for a team like the Celtics to overpay him since he makes them a genuine title contender for (probably) the next year or two.  For the Knicks, there's no payoff."

They already have the Australian Russell Westbrook though
"&gt;  certain teams play better when their stars iso  I feel like I'd be more willing to believe this if OKC had any success with Russ. He's a phenomenal player who's dragged down by the sheer amount of hero ball he plays. It worked out for him to the extent it did largely because of the insane level of raw talent he has. And he only started performing well in Houston once he stopped jacking up 3's and started focusing on what he does best. But OKC this season is performing better (40-24 before quarantine vs 39-25 last season at the same time) with worse talent. Last year they didn't cover their predicted w/l, this year they beat it by a large margin. You're telling me Russ and PG couldn't do on court what Shai and Gallo are doing? There is no basketball skill those two have that Russ and PG don't  &gt;i hate how this subreddit  I'm not a subreddit?   &gt; it doesn’t mean they’re “unwilling to be coached”   https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/russell-westbrook-doesnt-care-about-and-ignores-head-coach-billy-donovans-offensive-play-calls/  Also, let's just get back to the start. You said: ""Billy Donovan is doing a better job coaching this year"". Things you've said to support that include: (nothing)  I said: It's the change in players that's making him stand out. Things you've save to support this include: ""it worked horribly last year in spurts with Schroder and Felton but this year he has a rising star in Shai who can make that work."". "" their personnel this year better fits what scheme he wants to run."" ""Russ and PG almost never ran set plays"". "" they’re a bad fit for his scheme so they weren’t elevated by his coaching style""  Literally nothing you've said supports your principle argument that Billy Donovan is coaching better this year. Not a single example of him changing rotations in a different way, or running completely different plays. Everything you've said supports the fact that he has a different cast which is emphasizing the same coaching. And the fact is that this different cast is not as skilled as his previous one. And if skill isnt the different maker there's only one thing left and it's personality."
I chanted “Russell Westbrook” at Kevin Durant while he shot free throws at a game his first year with Golden State. It felt right

Let’s hope he doesn’t  pull a Russell Westbrook
I knew even with Zach Lowe's talk the other day about how Hou should win at the end of the day he would go Lakers in 6. You could feel him want to talk himself into the upset and what he felt could feasibly happen but knew it wouldnt feel responsible.  If we were getting the Jan-March version of Russell Westbrook then I think I would start looking at this as more of a 50-50 series. But that's just not reality not with where he is now and still recovering health wise
1. LeBron James   2. James Harden   3. Anthony Davis  4. Russell Westbrook  Looking at their rosters I actually think the Rockets have significantly better 3-6th best players. It won’t be enough to win the series ‘cause James and Davis are a way better star duo but I’m surprised
"For Kawhi: I think next year might be the year where he’s healthy enough to play at least 70 games. If he does he’s immediately going to be in the MVP conversation.   For Davis: I think this is the year where he makes it clear that he is the best player on the Lakers, not LeBron. If he leads the Lakers to a top seed while putting up his first option stats and play like a DPOY, he can be an MVP.  For Giannis: I think he won’t win MVP for the next couple years due to voter fatigue. It stops this year. He remains dominant and leads his team to a top seed. Typical Giannis stuff  For Luka: He’s not going to win for a couple years because either his team isn’t good enough or someone just has a better season than him. He wins it this year and the year after next.   For Tatum: He’s the next coming of Kobe in my opinion. He’s going to put up great offensive numbers while being an All-Defensive Team member. It also doesn’t hurt that he’s on the Celtics.  Cade Cunningham: His game is comparable to a Ben Simmons, but Cunningham can actually shoot. That plus a playoff team is recipe for an MVP.   For Trae: He’s going to pull a Russell Westbrook and break an unbreakable record of some sort. My guess it’s the lead the league in scoring and assists feat. His team might not be in the top of the conference, but the story will be good.  For Sekou: I see so much potential in him. If he develops correctly, he could become a Giannis type player. Not better or even the same as Giannis, but he’s going to play like him."

RoCo is the worst iso defender that Houston gives big minutes to which is shocking cause Russell Westbrook is on the team.  But RoCo is arguably the best help defender not named Giannis and AD in the league.  He anticipation for help d and getting steals and blocks is incredible.
"I used to have the OKC russell westbrook flair but I want to add it to Grand Floridan instead, but I don't think there's this option"
So all five. Your rebounder's name is Russell Westbrook.
"It's funny how someone can be so demonstrably wrong, yet still continue to spout their bullshit. If Nurkic's career is too small a sample size, why don't you provide anything that helps argue your point out side of your ""insight""?     Nurkic spaces the floor in the same way that Russell Westbrook does--he doesn't. Only time teams go up on Nurkic is when he sets a screen for Lillard or McCollum, and even then not then not both defenders go with the guard."
Keys to the series:  Lakers - don't play Javale McGee  Rockets - don't play Russell Westbrook
Is there anybody more overrated than James Harden/ Russell westbrook? They struggled vs a lone CP3 with an Shai Gilgeous as the 2nd best player on the roster... let’s not forget Westbrook lost to fucking Donovan Mitchell and people still rate this guy
"Because they can run out a ""small"" lineup of AD, Lebron, Green, KCP, Kuzma that is both longer and more athletic than the Rockets while having solid shooting and two players that can literally get a basket any time they want in the post.   I'd honestly put Green and Kuzma in there, too, just because of the matchups.  Kuzma and Green aren't exactly great post-up players, but they're skilled and they're going to be guarded by Westbrook, Harden, Eric Gordon, McLemore, Rivers.  Say you put Gordon or Westbrook on Kuzma, that's probably the best matchup but its still going to be brutally difficult for that person to play two ways and then you have two average to worse defensive guards on KCP and Green with at least 4 out of the five positions a strong mismatch.   And Lebron and AD were basically engineered in a lab to destroy the Rockets, they're very comfortable playing up tempo and dominating smaller players.    Its going to be brutal, it will be like watching the sixth graders take on the 9th graders.  Russell Westbrook is also going to take approximately 350 jump shots this series.  They can do it, but its going to require Westbrook to play a level of defense he hasn't hit in years and Harden to play a level of defense he's never hit while maintaining a disciplined style of play and no stupid decisions or hero ball from Westbrook.  Highly unlikely in my opinion, I wouldn't be surprised if this was a sweep."
No. We traded him away because Russell Westbrook became available and he and Harden are best friends.
CP3 and 4 1st round picks for Russell Westbrook? Who says no.
"It's not a technicality. There's a big difference between slapping it out of a player's hand and out of the ref's hand.  Especially since Dennis had *just* slapped it away from Westbrook about 3 seconds before the start of the video, so calling a T only on Russell would have been horsecrap."
Do you know what the ironic part is? Do you know who actually quit on his team? Russell Westbrook who asked for a trade in the middle of his contract because he didnt want to play for the Thunder anymore.  How actions work out in hindsight is irrelevant to the action itself.

The Lakers will be cheating off of a Rocket every time down the floor and his name is Russell Westbrook  Good luck punishing them with cuts if he’s blowing layups like in the fourth quarter tn
Harden is lucky Eric Gordon and Russell Westbrook even made this possible with his sorry play
russell westbrook is so bad. definitely got bailed out tonight
I'm not sure I've ever seen Russell Westbrook make a basket during a game of basketball.
Russell Westbrook goes to the Rockets and then beats his former team with said Rockets.  Brutal for Thunder fans
Props to James Harden for ruining Russell Westbrook losing to his old team juicy storyline we were all rooting for
I came here just to say that Russell Westbrook is pissing me the fuck off. The guy will not stop shooting the ball in crunch time OH MY FUCKING GOD HE JUST MISSED AGAIN
"Luguentz Dort has nine more points than the next leading scorer in a game with James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Eric Gordon, Danilo Gallinari, and Dennis Schroder"
Shai is showing his age. But what's Russell Westbrook excuse?
I for one had no clue Russell Westbrook was traded
"James ""Russell Westbrook"" Harden"
Lu Dort and Darius Bazley have as many points as James Harden and Russell Westbrook
"DORT IS LEADING ALL PLAYERS IN POINTS IN A GAME 7. A GAME 7 FEATURING CHRIS PAUL, RUSSELL WESTBROOK AND JAMES HARDEN"
"Through 39 minutes of the game involving Chris Paul, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, the leading scorer is Luguentz Dort with 27 points on 50-56-67 splits because why not."
It's awesome to watch Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook go back and forth possession by possession. What year is this? What teams are this? Where am I?
"Russell ""covid-who?"" Westbrook"
Russell westbrook revenge game
"Imagine hearing that Russell Westbrook would be more efficient than Harden, but Luguentz Dort would outplay both of them"
Because I actually watch and understand basketball my man.   Thunder win every time in the clutch. And they will again. It's a 1 point game lmfao. Like I would probably bet my life on cp3 making russell Westbrook and james harden fuck up and then us get swept by the lakers
Well today is Russell Westbrook day.
We call it the Russell Westbrook syndrome around these parts. He’d go 1/7 from 3 but the one make would be a buzzer beating game winner (which he shouldn’t have taken as he was 0/6) but he gets praise from everyone for the win and forgets that he is a lousy 3 shooter...
Russell westbrook playing like he want it today
"russell ""rodman"" westbrook!"
Lou Dort is outplaying James Harden and Russell Westbrook in a game 7....
Jimmy 'Russell Westbrook' Butler
"Jimmy ""Russell Westbrook"" Butler"
If the Thunder can get a Dort dagger to seal the deal I'm proposing we rename Russell Westbrook day to Dort day.
May I introduce you to one Russell Westbrook lol

"Out of curiosity, I looked at the last 30 years to find teammates who both finished top 7 in MVP voting and didn't win a championship. Top 7 is kind of arbitrary, but Top 5 was a little too tight and once you get past ~7 then there are some real outside MVP candidates that maybe only had a handful of votes.  -  * **2016:** Russell Westbrook (4) and Kevin Durant (5)  * **2014:** Blake Griffin (3) and Chris Paul (7)  * **2013:** Tony Parker (6) and Tim Duncan (7)  * **2011:** LeBron James (3) and Dwyane Wade (7)  * **2004:** Kobe Bryant (5) and Shaquille O'Neal (6)  * **2003:** Kobe Bryant (3) and Shaquille O'Neal (5)  * **1998:** Tim Duncan (5) and David Robinson (7)  -  That's actually more than I was expecting. I think people saying Stockton/Malone are kind of overrating Stockton. He was a very good player for a very long time but never a Tier 1 star. His highest finish in MVP voting was 7th one time and that was only with 3.3% of the voting share."

"Then, after winning a title with him, they trade him back to Houston for Russell Westbrook and Jeff Green. They win a ring with those two, then move them to Toronto for Serge and filler. After winning one final title, their revenge on OKC for making them get rid of their beloved 90s mascot (three guesses what his name was) will be complete."
"Clippers and Lakers are the favorites to come out of the West, it's a crabshoot in the East. Despite the bubble, these playoffs are/will be fun because there is no clear fa vorite (maybe Clippers?)  Check out game 7 of OKC vs Houston. Will be a good game and there is tons drama. The two stars from Houston played for OKC. Russell Westbrook, OKC's franchise GOAT was traded for OKC's current star Chris Paul who played alongside Harden in Houston. Harden and Paul don't like each other which was why Paul was traded in the first place. Chris Paul is the fiesty 5'11 guy. He's old now but still got a lot left in him. They call him the Point God, he's fuckin incredible to watch.  Also Heat in 6."
It is but he also had a russell westbrook like performance. Tried to do too much and not getting his teammates involved. He's not going to win the way he plays.
The “best player in the series” watched CP3 drill dagger after dagger all while setting Russell Westbrook up for failure on the offensive end.
"&gt; “**There’s a certain stigma — there’s no secret about that in Utah — and obviously the comments didn’t help**,” Mitchell said on Thursday. “But us as athletes want it to be known that we won’t stand for any of the racism and whatever else comes with that.”  -  &gt; “**The same people that were saying what they were saying are the same ones that were coming to celebrate and to cheer and I think that’s really where … I can’t lie to you, pretty pissed off. The past two or three years I gave it my all and then you see that and it’s tough to see that as an African American male**, not only because what happens in Utah and I understand it’s not just a Utah thing, I want people to understand that it’s not like it’s just Utah, it happens everywhere, it happens everywhere, but like I said I spoke out on it and especially being because I play here and I live here    Also, Mitchell after the Jazz fan/Russell Westbrook incident a few years ago   &gt; As a black man living in a community I love, and playing on a team that gives me the opportunity to live out my dreams, this incident hits close to home. Racism and hate speech hurts us all, and **this is not the first time something like this has happened in our area**"

Siakam channeling his inner Russell Westbrook today
"Yes, he always was. Even going back to last year and what he did for Philly. We are talking about perennial top 10 players here, Russell Westbrook isn’t one of them. If Russ being a top 10 player is dependent on KD/Steph being injured then fine russ can be considered a top 10 player.   PG13 is definitely a better player than Westbrook, is that even a controversial take? Considering what happened last season?"
"I don’t think this proves anything other than the fact that the narrative changes quite a bit over time. CP3 is simply a better player, he might not put up the same stats as Russell Westbrook or have highlight dunks but he simply reads and plays the game more effectively"
"Every time Russell Westbrook has a bad game people immediately like to forget that he is *also* one of the best point guards of our time and can easily drop 40 points tomorrow.  That isn't to say that he didn't have a bad game yesterday or that Chris Paul is by any means a lesser player... but come on, it's still Russell Westbrook."
"So you telling me that 2018 Cavs are the same as this years Rockets? Lebron with Jeff green, Eric Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Robert Covington, and countless other shooters are going to the finals"

"To be fair, CP3 did it with the advantage of facing Russell Westbrook"
"The undisputed number 1 player of the top team is hardly overrated. And as for most overrated in NBA history, you forgetting about the 6th seed Russell Westbrook? (Edit: 10th if you count the full league)"
"There’s a lot wrong with that point of view. Who has Billy Donovan developed? Huestis is out of the league. Ferguson is a bust. Semaj Christon is out of the league. Diallo doesn’t need playoff minutes. Dort was already a good defender.   I don’t know if you credit Adams developing under Billy. I guess you could. Same with Bazley. But he’s not a good developmental coach.   And he’s also made the playoffs every season because Presti has done his job. Billy has gotten to coach Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Victor Oladipo, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Dennis Schroder, Chris Paul, SGA, and Gallo. Point being, Billy always has good players around him. That’s why he’s always making the playoffs. Not because of his coaching."
As good as CP3 was and as exciting it was to see him play with that spark...Russell Westbrook absolutely shit the bed last night and Houston should have won
"by this logic we have to include derrick rose and russell westbrook in this conversation simply because they're MVPs. but we know they're close to top 5 point guards all time. MVP doesn't mean you leapfrog everyone who's not an MVP on all-time lists. Nash's historic greatness doesn't come from his MVP awards, it comes from what he did on the court. And whether what he did for his teams is more valuable than what CP3 did is very debatable."
You're taking Bam Adebayo over Russell Westbrook huh?   2020 has affected us all differently.
answers you let russell westbrook handle the ball instead of the perhaps the best 1v1 scorer of all time.

How about you accept the reality that some people, no matter how hard they train, can't become great shooters?

LeBron James is synonymous with hard work and has a lower 3-PT% today than he did in his 2nd year in the league."
"In fairness to Russ, Chris Paul could technically win more with the Thunder than Kevin Durant ever did without Russell Westbrook either as Durant lost the only series he had to play without Westbrook in 5 games (vs Memphis)."
"&gt; We literally saw this happen with CP3 and called him washed because his teammate was sabotaging him.  People called CP washed because he was bad in the playoffs basically all last year.  He had one ""great"" game throughout their entire run as the second option.  His impact was largely minimal throughout the entirety of the Utah series where Utah completely sold out on Harden and revolved their entire defense around him.  People weren't making these evaluations because ""his teammate was sabotaging him,"" it's because people watched CP be a bad second option almost all of last year, playoffs included.  &gt; What lost Houston the game is their star player standing around in the high elbow area screening for Russell Westbrook(who is coming off an injury) and not trying to get the ball?  Pinning the entire game on one individual play is really naive.  Was that one of the problems?  Yeah, absolutely. Shai was fronting him and hard denying the ball though.  Was Russ making three bad BBIQ decisions (regardless of what Harden should be doing) in a row one of the problems?  Yeah, I would argue that was more impactful than one play..  Was Gordon playing a fucking terribad game one of the problems?  Yeah, it was.  Again, I would argue that is more impactful than one play where Harden was being hard denied the ball by Shai fronting him."

Do you see signs of Harden wanting to make changes or the owner?"
I think he'd be Russell Westbrook
"Yes, the narrative that he could've had more rings had KD not joined the Warriors also totally ignores the fact that the 73-9 Warriors were up 3-1 in that series, Draymong got suspended for a key Game 5 at home and Bogut got injured. Steph also averaged a putrid 22/4/4 and it took a herculean effort by both LeBron and Kyrie to win that.  Even if KD had joined another team or stayed in OKC, nothing guarantees that the Cavs would be able to beat a healthy without suspensions 73-9 Warriors in a rematch, in fact i would bet they don't.  People just ignore all context and say LeBron's Finals losses don't matter and the 2016 ring has more value, spoilers: They do matter and the ring has the same value as any other ring.  Dirk Nowitzki beat LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden in his road to a championship. Nobody says that his ring has more value and nobody has him all-time ahead of Kevin Garnett, who was clearly better than him.  LeBron can win this year's ring and it still doesn't change the fact that Michael was a flat out better player, was more individually accomplished (MVPs/DPOYs, etc) and had less failures in the playoffs. The GOAT debate doesn't exist and it's only a product of recency bias.  I'm old enough to remember when people thought that the late great Kobe Bryant would end up being greater than Michael after his 5th ring, this shit literally will always happen when an all-time great gets rings, but when you analyze it deeply, Michael still owns them."
Russell Westbrook 🤯🤯🤯 that’s a fucking mistake
"Russell Westbrook hasn't played well in the playoffs in like 4 years, get the nostalgia out of your head."
"&gt; I class him with Russell Westbrook as guys who will NEVER win a championship as a ""star player.""  While I don't necessarily disagree, the reason why you can't win a chip w/ Russ as your #1 is completely different from why you can't w/ PG"
All straight from my heart. You know how bitter and hateful a man becomes after being a Russell Westbrook fan on this sub for 5 years?
"Reminds me of a few years ago when Dwight said: ""I know I'm a champion.""  These guys mindsets are weird. Now, Dwight might actually become a champion...as a role player. But when he was the main guy he had one Finals run.  Paul George is mentally weak...I class him with Russell Westbrook as guys who will NEVER win a championship as a ""star player."" Maybe they'll do like Dwight and get one as a role player.  Watching last night made me grateful that even if we got Year 17 LeBron, we have a guy who would NEVER blow a 3-1 lead with double digit leads in 3 straight close out games, while scoring 2 points in the 2nd half and 0 in the 4th.  I think once some time passes we'll understand just how absolutely awful this performance was. Legendary collapse, legacy defining shit"
"Maybe they can draft players like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Kevin Durant. Can you imagine a team with all three of these players?  Draft, ELC, trade for picks, draft, ..."
"Call me a hater, but I'm honestly sick of Russell Westbrook receiving accolades. The dude is not a winning player."
Yo the ps5 is dropping on my birthday lol. And Brodie aka russell westbrook

I don’t think Russell Westbrook should be on this list. He’s not that dude anymore.
its quite a bit. Russell Westbrook had a TS of 54 while Lebron had a TS of 58 in the regular season. Its definitely a difference.

Westbrook.  I don't think any fan or any team would feel an ounce of excitement having WB on their team at his current price.  I mean can you imagine that?  Being told your team traded players/assets for the Russell Westbrook of today?  It's like spending a mountain of money on something useless and cranky
The Russell Westbrook move I see. Fucking scum
All Bootum First Team  Steph Curry  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Paul George  Joel Embiid  Tell me that’s not a hell of a lineup
"Okay, I looked.   They gave him a 16.5% chance in Wisconsin, 21.1% chance in Michigan, and 23% chance in PA. Those aren't nothing, and as you know, 538 is only as good as the polling you feed into it, so now that we know that there were substantial flaws in polls in 2016 (most notably not weighting by education, which is a standard now), I think 538 did pretty well considering where other predictions were (iirc the NYT was something like 95% Clinton, which seems high).   Again, I think if you told most people on election day that Trump had a 30% chance of winning they'd think you were crazy.   To put it in NBA terms, Trump had better odds of winning in 2016, according to 538, than Russell Westbrook had of making a 3 pointer this season. Just  because Westbrook misses most of his 3s doesn't mean that we should attack bball reference when he hits one."
Russell Westbrook?  Double teaming Harden was even worse because they had insane spacing so there was always a wide open shooter.
A 30% chance happens fairly often.  30% of the time actually.    If Russell Westbrook takes a three pointer you'd say he's *probably* gonna miss it but it wouldnt be that surprising if it went in.    Which sites had a formula predicting a Trump victory? Rasmussen?
And Russell Westbrook averaged 31.6/10.4/10.6 in a season. Which is better than Prime LeBron numbers. So what’s your point again.
Ah nice of a Houston fan to join as well. Have fun with your owner and Russell Westbrook. (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
The whole Russell Westbrook fiasco    I personally don’t care about it and I haven’t heard anything in a longggg time but plenty of people think he’s too arrogant for his talent level
1. Alex Caruso 2. Jared Dudley 3. The player Pat Bev imagines himself to be  4. Undercover Laker Russell Westbrook  5. Danny Green when he isn’t playing  6-10. Whoever else because it ain’t even close
I couldn't believe when he went full Russell Westbrook and bricked that three off the side of the backboard in the fourth. That was comically bad.
"Russell Westbrook, who according to r/nba is garbage, carried a squad with a starting lineup that included Andre Roberson, Taj Gibson and Steven Adams, all 3 of which couldn't shoot the ball outside 5 feet from the basket, into the 6 seed.  AD had Jrue, who is better than any player Russ had, and they didn't even get close to the playoffs. If you are truly a top 5 player you should be able to get there."
"I'd rather see:   LAC: Chris Paul  OKC: Russell Westbrook  HOU: Paul George, Lou Williams"
"That was only that particular day it doesn’t repeat every year. Russell Westbrook Day does repeat, however. Also we didn’t make a PG day after he demanded a trade that’d just be silly."
Is Paul George becoming the new Russell Westbrook? It seems like teams just can’t win with him for some reason.

Lol Russell Westbrook isn’t a negative asset. He was recovering from covid and an injury where he was sidelined for months.
 Russell westbrook was right about pat bev

Curry wasn’t the reason they won. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook lost that series more than the Warriors won it. Even Andre Iguodala said the Thunder were the better team that year.
Mans biggest Claim to fame is when he intentionality injuried Russell WestBrook. Pat BeVs a 🤡
"&gt;*First of all, Westbrook is the complete opposite of the kind of ""static, non-playmaking player"" you mentioned.*  Russell Westbrook is a ball dominant, high turnover machine with minimal off-ball movement who is undisciplined defensively and overall poor on that end. He also has poor shot selection and a tendency to play ""hero ball"". Static = ball stopper. non-playmaking = high turnovers, hero ball, bad shot selection.   &gt;*Secondly, Curry running around screens and Westbrook attacking the paint would be a ridiculously good combo.*  It would be fine, but they wouldn't have had a dynasty. Considering their offense already effectively did the ""Westbrook attacking the paint"" using motion and entry passes to the high post, we shouldn't expect any increase in production on offense. In fact, I would suggest that the ball rotations stopping with Westbrook as he looks to isolate and drive would have a net negative on the team. It would take everyone else out of rhythm. Pair that with Westbrook's undisciplined shot selection, it's not a good match.  And defensively, boy would they take a massive hit. You're taking a good defender off the floor for a bad one across the board.  &gt;*I'm legitimately confused as to why you think two of the best playmakers in the game would be a bad fit, especially when Curry plays so well off ball.*  Hope I can clear up the confusion. Neither Westbrook nor Curry are two of the best playmakers in the game ^(well, maybe Curry but that is a stretch). They both have a tendency to turn the ball over at much higher rates than they are creating points off distribution compared to other greats. Curry is significantly better though on ball or off and *probably* capable of being one, but he hasn't been asked to be his team's primary playmaker, so that style of play didn't develop. Curry is a lot like a Steve Nash who was asked to be the primary scorer, not facilitator. If it was the opposite, I could see Curry being a damn near mirror image of Nash."
"&gt;*Edit: scratch that, who is a starter that Durant played with who wouldn't compliment Curry?*  Russell Westbrook"

How many draft picks have the Thunder collected in exchange for Paul George and Russell Westbrook?
Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook should pay the Nuggets for making all these elite teams in the West blowing 3-1 leads.
How do they have enough fans to have a subreddit?   It most be pretty bare there. So much for that battle of LA.   Damn clippers your officially the most cursed franchise in Sports? No you’re not just cursed. This years teams have to be one of the most unlikable teams ever.   They absolutely deserved to lose. But just trade for Russell Westbrook some how. That’ll make it better.
Judging Jimmy Butler based on his point total for a game is inaccurate of his value to his team winning (Heat ain't here without him and that's a fact). Russell Westbrook runs up the stats but contributes less to his teams success.
Did that ball heckle russell westbrook? BECAUSE IT WAS JUST ESCORTED FROM THE ARENA
"&gt;*Why don't you count Draymond, Iguodala, Klay for Durant too?*  Lol, alright. Durant had Draymond, Iguodala, Klay, and Livingston as teammates for 3 of those 10 years.  My point is, Durant is easier to surround with talent and win 50 games than Curry. You also need less, and less specific roles.  &gt;*You're trying to make this weird argument where you split up Durant's teammates and say stuff like ""well Harden was only around for two of his 50 win seasons"" when the reality is that KD has had an MVP level teammate for pretty much that entire 10 year stretch.*  Harden came off the bench when he played with Durant, he was not anywhere near an MVP candidate. Also, Russell Westbrook never received 1 first place vote for MVP during his time with Durant. So no, he wasn't playing with an MVP level teammate, lol. Westbrook's was about as controversial as any, and Harden's coming a half decade after being teammates?  &gt;*But I don't really want to go further down this path of comparing teammates like this. Both had good teammates. One of them got it done without the other, it's really that simple.*  Only one had a core of teammates for every 50 win season + championship that includes 3 other smart 2-way starters; two of whom can take on PG responsibilities as WINGs and the other is possibly the 2nd best shooter ever, a reliable backup that can comfortable create points for himself, and a coach.  Durant didn't need any of that to win 50 games a year for 7 years before joining the Warriors. Durant's offensive production has also been very consistent over that timeframe indicating it's because of him, not the system while also being a world better defensively.  Curry's probably your favorite player I get it, but there have always been a couple guys in the league better than him. Even when he was winning his unanimous MVP."
* Jeff Green was a teammate for 2 of those 10 years of 50 win seasons * James Harden was a teammate for 3 of those 10 years of 50 win seasons * Shaun Livingston was a teammate for 2 of those 10 years of 50 win seasons * Thabo Sefolosha was a teammate for 5 of those 10 years of 50 win seasons * Serge Ibaka for 7 of those 10 years * Russell Westbrook for 7 of those 10 years  Compared to Curry:  * Draymond Green was a teammate for all six 50 win seasons and every championship * Klay Thompson was a teammate for all six 50 win seasons and every championship * Andre Iguodala was a teammate for all six 50 win seasons and every championship * Shaun Livingston was a teammate for five of the six 50 win seasons and every championship * Steve Kerr was a coach for five of the six 50 win seasons and every championship * Harrison Barnes was a teammate for three of the six 50 win seasons and a championship * Andrew Bogut was a teammate for three of the six 50 win seasons and a championship * Leandro Barbosa was a teammate for two of the six 50 win seasons and a championship
"Your point about 50 wins is pretty disingenuous. Curry first made the postseason in his third healthy season (he missed the 2011-12 season due to ankle injury). Durant made the postseason in his third season as well. Durant came into the league younger, and was drafted 2 years before Curry. He reached a lot of milestones first and  has a greater volume of things like 50 win seasons mostly because he's played more healthy seasons.  Durant had 50 wins in his third season and Curry had 47, then 51 in his fourth and has not been part of a team that won less than 57 since.   Furthermore, you focus on Curry's teammates but not Durant's. Durant's teammates the first season he hit 50 wins:  - Russell Westbrook - James Harden - Serge Ibaka - Shaun Livingston - Jeff Green - Thabo Sefolosha  They were a first round out while Curry took his team to the second round, beating the 2 seed Nuggets in his first postseason.  What happens if you look at Durant before Westbrook and Harden show up? 20-62."
"First, because the methodology is nebulous and unclear. Second, because it judges a lot of defense by how closely a player is contesting a jump shooter, which is a really dumb way to judge defense. Being late on a contest after helping on a drive and preventing a layup shouldn't hurt your defensive impact, and neither should leaving Giannis or Russell Westbrook open for an above the break 3 with 12 seconds left on the shot clock. Third, it seems to vastly overvalue 3 point percentage for rating offensive impact.  It's essentially worthless pseudoscience with no empirical data to back up whether or not what it's measuring actually impact winning. There are ridiculous ratings being spit out by RAPTOR right now, like Kemba Walker (+6.0 OFF, +0.9 DEF, +6.9 TOTAL) being a higher impact player than LeBron James (+4.5 OFF, +2.1 DEF, +6.6 TOTAL) and Nikola Jokic (+5.6 OFF, +1.2 DEF, +6.8 TOTAL), or Marcus Smart (+2.3 OFF) being higher impact offensive player than Anthony Davis (+2.2 OFF) and which literally no statistical formula should be spitting out under any circumstances.  Some of the outcomes are patently absurd and have no basis in any reality. It's less than worthless, in that paying attention to it will make you a less intelligent basketball fan. The RAPTOR based forecast also currently has the Celtics at 60% to win the finals, which again, is completely absurd."
You're right. There is a reason why he became a better player.  https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2017/11/29/victor-oladipo-praises-russell-westbrook-during-career-year-i-learned-so-much-from-him/
Russell Westbrook
&gt;MDA leaves Rockets  New Headline hours later: &gt;NBA Coach Says Rockets' Russell Westbrook 'Isn't a Good Complement for Anyone'  Gee. I wonder which coach said it 🤔
"Russell Westbrook might be one of the most one dimensional stars in the league right now lmfao. His game relies on his athleticism while he drives in and kicks the ball out. If he can't do that, he has pretty terrible games. He can't shoot from 3. His midrange is inconsistent. His defense is subpar to average...."
"Nobody is giving up anything of value for a declining, injury prone volume scorer.  D'antoni was as good as it gets if you're building a team around James Harden and Russell Westbrook"
"I feel like it would be easier to build around Carmelo Anthony than Russell Westbrook.  Westbrook just seems like one of those guys who needs to become the system in order to maximize his output, yet isn't efficient enough to justify it on a contending team.  At least Melo is capable of playing off the ball so you can run different offensive looks.  The one thing that makes this hard is that Westbrook is definitely a better defender than Melo."
"Take this for what you will but here are the 2000-2019 MVP’s ranked by PIPM  1.  2009 LeBron James (9.9) 2. 2010 LeBron James (8.7) 3. 2016 Stephen Curry (8.2) 4. 2004 Garnett (8.1) 5. 2015 Stephen Curry (8.1) 6. 2013 LeBron James (7.8) 7. 2019 Giannis Antetumnkpo (7.8) 8. 2000 Shaq (7.2) 9. 2003 Tim Duncan (7.1) 10. 2012 LeBron James (7.0) 11. 2017 Russell Westbrook (6.8) 12. 2018 James Harden (5.8) 13. 2002 Tim Duncan (5.7) 14. 2005 Steve Nash (5.5) 15. 2014 Kevin Durant (5.2) 16. 2007 Dirk Nowitzki (5.1) 17. 2008 Kobe Bryant (4.4) 18. 2006 Steve Nash (4.4) 19. 2001 Allen Iverson (3.2) 20. 2011 Derrick Rose (2.8)   So according to this Rose, AI, ‘06 Nash, Kobe, Dirk  Don’t nessecarily agree but it isn’t too egregious"
"No, I'm not saying they are all equal. I'm saying there isn't anything in Westbrooks history that would suggest he was really that big of a factor in them getting to a finals. Look at Westbrooks career from year 1 to now. Where is there any indication that the overall package that Westbrook brings leads to much winning? He made 1 finals - in a year that he played alongside 2 guys we will be telling our grandkids about. Tell me playing with a guy like Kevin Durant and James Harden (who put up one of the best 6th man seasons we will ever see and actually played 30+ mins), Serge Ibaka was damn good by that point too, tell me that team needs much at all to be good enough to make and lose a finals.   Let's try and put this into another context. Let's say you've got a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Without knowing what else is on that team is it hard for you to imagine them dragging their squad to a finals? What about say Lebron and Klay Thompson? Or Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry. We can play this game for days, really. If we can see fairly easily that he has a way of playing that doesn't exactly elevate his team much than you are actually allowed to revisit how important he actually was. Russell Westbrook is a guy who does a good job giving the impression that he is super important by inserting himself into the action like he is, but the results don't support it.  And before someone chimes in with the old ""Harden was not the player he is now"", that's true. He didn't handle the ball like he does now, how could he. Don't be fooled by the 6th man tag. This 6th man was 6th in the entire NBA in win shares that year, his ws/48 was exactly the same as Kevin Durant (.230). So you are right, of course, everyone except Lebron has needed a Pippen. There is your Pippen. In fact, and I know defense doesn't translate that well to advanced stats, but Pippen never even came close to .230 ws/48in his career - ever. Then Harden left, no more finals.  Once you stop being impressed by making a single finals alongside 2 of the best players you will ever see, the true net impact of Westbrook becomes very, very clear.  He still plays the same, it just took a long time for people to realize that he only experienced success when he had such phenomenal talent on the court that he could make all the same highlights, and lowlights, and still come out on the winning end of things."
How does one Russell Westbrook sound?
Title had me doing the Russell Westbrook “what?!?”
Russell Westbrook is such a loose cannon lmao his emotions during games just seem completely out of his control
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Draymond Green and Steven Adams"
Real big maturity difference when comparing Jordan and pippen to Russell Westbrook
No team should trade for Russell Westbrook. When has he proven to be an impactful player in the playoffs?
"As a Laker fan, I feel bad for CP3, James Harden, and Mike D'Antoni. They should have ran it back with them. Instead, CP3 and Capela get traded for Russell Westbrook and Robert Covington.  ????"
I disagree.  Westbrook is definitely a good compliment to Russell.
"Russell Westbrook is not a Top 50 Player Ever nor is a Top 10 PG of All Time.  His numbers are on high usage, horrid efficiency, and at the detriment to his team.   He lacks the intangibles other great pgs have.   He gets assists to stuff the stat sheet, but still doesn't understand how to read the game and make his teams offense flows.   Hos whole game is to get stats and play selfish ball.  A players that shouldve never won a MVP, and a player yall have overrated for a decade."
He said Russell Westbrook not Patrick Beverley
"Imagine D'Antoni coaching James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and a team of shooters built for fast-paced smallball."
"Instead of surveying quotes and “sources” of fucking cryptic quotes that say more to Billy Donavon play style, how about we get direct quotes from players?   “Austin Rivers: ‘Russell Westbrook Is My Favorite Teammate I’ve Ever Had.”  “Enes Kanter calls Russell Westbrook and Steven Adams his favorite teammates of all time” (played with Kemba)   “That’s crazy,” Collison said. “Him coming to play and compete every night is almost underrated. The consistency of him, the durability, the production—being there night after night and competing, as a teammate, there is really nothing more than you want. He’s gotten so much better from a leadership level, how he talks to teammates … it’s like school, where you have the cool guys everyone gravitates towards. He’s always been one of those guys.”   “Him opening the city up, opening the team up, he just made me comfortable,” George said. “On the court, he just made the game easy. I played in Indiana, where the last couple years, I was in his position, where he was, trying to make plays for everybody. When I got here, the game was way easier. I just connected with him. The bond was formed immediately. We respect each other. I love everything that he brings on and off the court.”    “I thought he was insane,” Schroder told The Crossover. “How he approaches the game—it’s incredible.” As a teammate, Schroder says, Westbrook has “helped me a lot.” Added Schroder, “You respect him so much, when he says something, you don’t want to let him down. He needs guys he can trust, and you want to be one of those guys.”  “Robert Covington on Russell Westbrook: ‪“He’s electrifying but a lot of people sit up here and don’t understand that Russ is probably one of the best teammates I’ve ever had, like as far as how much of a professional he is. A lot of people try to make him seem like he’s a bad person but he’s not.”‬  “Enes Kanter 'loved playing' with former teammate Russell Westbrook”    “He’s getting [the numbers] within the game. It's not like he's forcing it. It's something I've never seen before. It's a blessing for all of us to be a part of that type of greatness. He's doing it for the team. He's leading us. We're just following him.”  Let me know if I should keep going"
"KEVIN MARTIN -   Unlike Oladipo (above), Kevin Martin never took to being a score-first shooting guard trying to share the ball with Russell Westbrook after stepping in for an elite player. Signing after James Harden walked following almost being the unanimous choice for the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year, Martin was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves after just a single season with the Thunder in 2012-13. Of his new club up North, Martin noted “this is such a fun team to play on. Nobody is trying to lead the league in scoring here.” (Ironically, his teammate Kevin Love was actually leading the league in scoring at the time.)"
&gt;Comparing Russell Westbrook to Valenciunas is...   Unfair... Valunciunas might have a future in the league.   I've been a Westbrook hater since his MVP season. He beats up on inferior competition and he can't do a fucking thing against good teams. He's a guard with no jump shot and its 2020.
Not being a good fit with anyone isn't the same thing as trash. You can be tremendously skilled and still not fit into a team very effectively. Just look at Russell Westbrook for example.
Russell Westbrook was the one that knocked us out of playoff contention in 2017 with his 35 foot buzzer beater
I am 100% sure there is an agenda right now targeting Russell Westbrook for some reason. I’m not surprised it’s bleacherreport either.
I don't even think the Warriors would play Russell Westbrook even if they got him for veterans minimum
"&gt;Russell Westbrook pulled him aside in a preseason game to tell him that he would have to play defense in the NBA  Westbrook passing on this shit like it's a real pearl of wisdom. He probably had a realisation last year that he should be playing defense and now he's trying to pass it on, like ""I wish someone had told me this when I was a rookie"""
"Russell Westbrook, in the playoffs, has provided as much benefit towards winning a championship as JV, DeRozan or Holiday have to their respective teams.  They are good, even great players at times, that can win you games when they’re on, but none of them are good enough to be the first or second choice on a championship winning team.   Russ was good enough to be first choice in his MVP year, and can still be a second option if he recovers from his injury and covid well. But given what I’ve seen from covid recoveries, i believe it’s unlikely Russ will recover well enough to perform at his best."
"Russell Westbrook will be 32 before the next season starts, and has played almost 1,000 games between regular season and playoffs, and has had a couple injuries and surgeries, and now covid.   I don't think he would be signing a 3/60 at age 34"

"Russell Westbrook has the lowest basketball IQ of any player with superstar potential. He also can't shoot and maybe he does work on his shot a lot, but unfortunately for some it's just not their gift. I'd probably want him as a 6th man off the bench. He won't win a championship as the main guy or even a 2nd option. Just a great athlete."
"Probably not great ""guesses"", but if I were picking it'd look something like:  **FIRST TEAM**  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  James Harden  LeBron James (as a guard)  **SECOND TEAM**  Anthony Davis (as a forward)  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  **THIRD TEAM**  Brandon Ingram  Khris Middleton  Rudy Gobert  Devin Booker (It'll probably be CP3 but Booker deserves love here.)  Russell Westbrook"
This morning I told my wife she was looking very Russell Westbrook today. Needless to say that NBA coach was correct.
"Yeah, Allen Iverson didn't need to do 271 moves in front of a defender like Kyrie because he had such ridiculous speed and such a crazy first step that all he needed was his crossover. The same can also be said about Russell Westbrook and Derrick Rose.  Luka is an okay athlete. Compared to his peers he isn't crazy fast, he can't jump super high and he ain't that strong either. Yeah, he is 6-7 230 pounds with skill, but that doesn't mean he is a crazy athlete for NBA standards. Andrew Wiggins and his 44-inch vertical is a crazy athlete, not Luka."
"Ben Simmons, Luka, Ricky Rubio, Russell Westbrook"
Yes indeed there is no one who makes better decisions than Russell Westbrook with a head of steam late in a close game.

"Russell Westbrook   Darren Collison   Luc Mbah a Moute   Kevin Love  Throw in Shipp who was really tidy, and their team looks even better now."
"Russell Westbrook gets so much hate for how he carries himself on the court, he never gives up that’s why he’s honestly one of my favorite players in the league.   Great person and a great player that people love to doubt. He’ll be back next year."
Russell “The Right Thing” Westbrook.
"When Russell Westbrook came home and you could see him emotional when the Thunder played the video tribute. He's the guy who got me interested in the NBA, I started watching this sport for Russ. I'm not sure that people quite understand what he means to the Thunder fans. His heart and loyalty was so important after 2016, a moment where the franchise stood on a precipice. When he was traded, it was horrible to see. It was brilliant to see him back at the Peake in front of his fans"
"&gt;JB it’s a great defender but can he defend LeBron, Giannis or AD.  He literally defended all three this season.  He also defended:  * Pascal Siakam * Bam Adebayo * Tobias Harris * Kristaps Porzingis * Kevin Love * James Harden * Al Horford * Jimmy Butler * Paul George * Ben Simmons * Russell Westbrook   I guess you're unaware of the fact that Jaylen guards our best opponent 1-4 on most nights."
"Yeah, famous post-season overachievers like Blake Fucking Griffin, Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Those first and second-round staples.   You realise how stupid it looks when you apply radically different criteria to different players, right? If Giannis isn't a lock for top ten because he got beat in the playoffs then why the actual fuck would Blake Griffin be anywhere near the competition. Giannis last year did better in the playoffs than Blake has in his entire career.  If AD not being able to close games in the playoffs makes him questionable in the top ten, then how the actual fuck do you justify having PG anywhere near the list?  You have players you don't like and hold them to a higher standard. There is no reasonable rating system on the planet that would put Blake, PG, Wall, Beal, Kyrie, Dipo or Tatum over AD or Giannis."
"Apparently a lot of athletes consider signing with Jordan almost branding suicide because none of their athletes, not even Russell Westbrook, have had a successful shoe. Nobody wants to by a Westbrook Jordan. They buy Jordan for *Jordan.*"
"Why is no one talking about Russell triple double machine Westbrook in this thread? His career stats in all three categories aren't even that far from Lebron's. Subtract a rebound and add an assist, plus his PPG this season was better than Lebron's career avg. The statistical chances of him having a game where he outduels Lebron seem pretty high."
"Russell Westbrook, Kyrie was absolutely booty juice until game 3. And he couldn’t get others involved for shit, Lebron couldn’t sit for 2 minutes without them blowing a lead.   Russ with all that spacing would’ve been amazing and wouldn’t have lost the Cavs the lead every time Lebron sat."
"And yet his impact statistics are down across the board to a comical degree. The Rockets fell off a cliff when James Harden was out, but they were just fine with James Harden on and Russell Westbrook off."
A Russell Westbrook/Ben Simmons backcourt sounds like it has the spacing to kill Darryl Morey
that's what russell westbrook was supposed to do for our team :(
"For sure! Its basically a cliche at this point to say it, but I imagine people who parrot the ""lol triple single!"" Thing haven't actually watched very many warriors games. Which like, sidenote, I do kinda hate when people here use that like it's an insult. Not everybody has the time to watch every single team play every single game every single night. But yeah, I guess they didn't watch many warriors games lol  Draymond is also tied in 4th place for all time Playoff Triple Double leaders, so it's not even that accurate either. He has as many career playoff triple doubles as Larry Bird, Rajon Rondo and Russell Westbrook, and only one less than 3rd place Jason Kidd.   I don't know how well he'd work on many teams, but I can tell you had be an AMAZING fit for the raptors. Awesome defense, great ball handling and facilitation, incredible bbiq. He's not the type of player you'd want to build around, but he's the type you could add to a competitor and will elevate them."
"Damien Lillard, Russell Westbrook and Jamal Murray say otherwise"
[He did](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-jordan-says-russell-westbrook-reminds-him-of-his-younger-self/)
"""Russell Westbrook has an outside shot at overtaking LeBron"" in turnovers.  &amp;#x200B;  Yup math checks out."
"They just need Demarcus Cousins, Russell Westbrook, Lance Stevenson and they got themselves a Suicide Squad."
because they don't matter whatsoever. they lost the title. it's the regular season.  they won a title two season before he went there.  what literally happened is that KD left the OKC thunder and went on to achieve a new level of greatness that he could never do with Russell Westbrook because he refused to change his playstyle to benefit the team and it was the smartest free agency move that's ever been done in the history of professional sports.
Russell Westbrook was an MVP 3 years ago and his skillset is completely different from Lavine's. This is a bad argument.
"I couldn’t agree more. The votes hold so little meaning when they are given to people in the media who do not watch the games - or rather, do not watch enough games to be able to make an informed decision. A player’s “hype” can get them votes. And Pat Bev is nothing but his own hype... all that talk of how he’s such a “dawg” it really does just come from him running his mouth constantly, to anyone and everyone, intentionally injuring people, then not apologizing or admitting he’s wrong - ever. After he took out Russ’s knees, all the interviews he gave was like “I didn’t do anything wrong, and I’d do it again.” I hate when after he makes an obviously dirty play announcers will say shit like “great defense! so aggressive! Such a dawg!” It is not great defense. Pat Bev’s “reputation” is what got him  the votes. Not his defense. Russell Westbrook was 1000% right and gave us one of the best and most realest quotes lol"
"Dude, I can't tell if you're messing with me.   It's a ridiculous and arbitrary 'comparison-type' argument that I think is a lazy and low-quality answer to the question. I realize that this is reddit, but I just expect the top-voted response to be something a little bit more substantive and thought provoking than ""No b/c Westbrook isn't and he's MVP"".     Westbrook's ability to win a title has literally nothing to do with Lavine's ability to be the first option on a contender. Clearly, the answer to the OP's question is still most likely no, but I'm seriously struggling to understand how/why Russell Westbrook of the Houston Rockets has *anything* to do with it at all.   Is the argument that Westbrook and Lavine are similar players, so therefore Lavine *simply cannot* achieve more playoff success than Westbrook? Do we need to be reminded that Lavine and Westbrook are not even remotely similar players outside of their shared trait of athleticism?  Instead of phrasing it as ""Russell is an MVP"", please reconsider it this way. Russell was a 2x regular season MVP who isn't a good or consistent enough scorer to be the first option on a deep-run playoff team, let alone a championship team. The Thunder WERE a championship-caliber team while Kevin Durant was around, but have had absolutely no playoff success with Russ at the helm.    Zach Lavine hasn't had the chance to play on a good NBA team, has a totally different skillset from Russ, and is coming off the best season in his career so far, despite being coached by Egghead Boylen. These reasons + Zach Lavine's offensive capabilities are why the answer to OP's question doesn't have to definitively be ""NO"", and DEFINITELY is not ""NO, CUZ WESTBROOK NOT AND HE MVP""."
"Dwight Howard and Russell Westbrook are surefire hall of famers.  Where did I talk shit? I'm saying that his playoff success cannot be argued vs AD because he had teams that were so much worse, and similarly to AD lost to the KD warriors."
Russell Westbrook is an MVP and he's not good enough to be the best player on a championship team so Zach Lavine definitely isn't.
"Harden has also had Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and an okay Dwight Howard on those teams. Who has AD had? Cousins who was injured halfway through the season?"
"This is though,  Russell Wilson &amp; Steph Curry?  Ja Morant &amp; Kyler Murray?  Pop &amp; Bellichek?  Russell Westbrook &amp; Cam Newton?  Anthony Davis &amp; Alvin Kamara?"
6.Paul George for Russell Westbrook
Neither.   It should be judged on what happens in the playoffs.   Numbers can’t measure the size of a players heart. And I don’t mean that as being cheesy or a cliche.   Paul George is an all star and sometimes an MVP candidate. But do you want the ball in his hands in the 4th quarter of a playoff game?   Russell Westbrook wins MVP awards. Do you want him taking a game winning shot attempt?
My dream is for old russell Westbrook after this supermax to sign with the lakers and go for one last run as the backup PG  Alternatively if Tillman wants to somehow buy this dude out :)
"Sure. Why was it easier for Jordan to beat out Malone, Hakeem, Barkley, The Admiral and Magic than it is for Lebron to beat Curry, KD, Giannis and Harden? Russell Westbrook? Derrick Rose? These guys are competing with the same talent as Lebron is, winning MVPs over him. And Lebron legitimately had no argument for most of those. Jordan isn't competing with those shitty, awful bench quality starters for MVPs and DPOYs. He's competing with hall of famers and top 25 guys who would shit on any era they played in."
Yep. The playoffs have shown the Lakers don't have to shoot well or even average to win. They can win while shooting at a by far league worst clip. The only time they can't win is when they collectively shoot like Russell Westbrook on a *really* off night.
"Which Spur team was ""Historic""?  The one that won 67 games and got excused from the playoffs in the second round by noted playoff monster Russell Westbrook?  The one that snuck in one Finals trip between the Phil Jackson's Bulls' and Lakers' Threepeats?  The ones with 12 first and second round losses over those 20 years?"
"Kyrie is not nearly as ball dominant as Russell is. He spots up a lot, comes off screens, cuts without the ball. Last year as the bonafide 1st option was the first time he's taken more than 20 shots a game. And he barely gets to the line so it's not like he's soaking up possessions that way. And he's super efficient. He's not a guy that takes a bunch of bad shots.   Westbrook has taken more than 20 shots a game 5 times AND he isn't an off ball threat and he basically controls all the offense when he's on the floor.   Totally different situations."
One guy was arguing with me that OKC would have been better off keeping Paul George and Russell Westbrook and trying to compete for championships instead of trading them.
"1. The Pacers have at least won a conference title and gone to the finals. Something MDA hasn't done in his career.   2. So he's the offensive version of the guy they just fired. Pass.  3. Steve Nash, Amare Stoudamire, and Shawn Marion were the perfect fit for his offense. James Harden and Russell Westbrook were the perfect fit. Got nowhere with either.   We know who he is. He's not a winner. I'd take the unknown over him any day."
For one slightly used Russell Westbrook? DEAL!
Russell Westbrook tweeting out: “Russell Westbrook”
"You are right that it is a smaller sample size, but it's enough for https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career_p.html to use for their leaderboard. They have set minimum requirements for every stat including career playoffs ppg and his stats have met the minimum requirements. Also in the career regular season ppg where the amount of games that he has played is a much bigger sample size he still ranks 22nd all time right above Shaq, Carmelo Anthony, Steph Curry, and Russell Westbrook. Also if you want to compare AD's first eight regular seasons career ppg to Tim Duncan's first eight regular seasons career ppg, AD averaged 24.0 ppg to Duncan's 22.5 ppg."
Russell Westbrook never had an eFG% above 50 or TS above 55%. Luka did that despite his shooting issues. There’s no comparison in scoring efficiency. It’s like saying Giannis is not an efficienct scorer because of his bad 3pt and FT shooting
and only 55 comments. But if there was a thread with a picture of Russell Westbrook dying his hair a bizarre color there'd be 34k upvotes and 3k comments within hours.
"Sports medicine is growing, so I assume with the growth in recovery time, retirement time is slightly increasing incrementally as well.  Weight training has taken a big turn towards resistance bands and body weight exercises as well, which puts a lot less stress on joints over the years. Plyometrics is huge right now. That on top of nutritional studies have guys performing an extra 5 years compared to the 90s and prior.  I went to school for exercise physiology and the field is growing rapidly, not just with new methodology in terms of training, but with nutrition and recovery as well. Some of the stuff that’s being used now (see, Tom Brady, Russell Westbrook) is becoming the norm."
"a combination of injuries and horrible coaching. AD was injured last season, then chose to sit to make the trade happen.  James Harden is a ball-dominant guard who can initiate the offense. He is a QB. AD is a big man. He can not initiate the offense. He is a WR. Just because a Qb gets to have the ball more than the WR doesn't make him better. It is possible for the best WR to be better than one of the best QBs. they literally play different positions.  Jrue Holliday has been injured. Cousin got injured that year and Davis beat the still beat Blazers in the first round of the playoffs.. Literally Rondo didn't get re-signed. Mirotic? where the fuck is he now.  Harden had CP3 and Russell Westbrook.  Kawhi has had Duncan, Parker, Ginobili--- then Lamarcus Aldridge. not to mention Popovich."
"Russell Westbrook is my favourite player but he is not the most thick skinned player in the league. Confident, yes but he is prone to yapping back at players/fans who heckle him."
"Confident: Bill Russell, Tim Duncan, Larry Bird, Jason Kidd  Insecure: Chris Paul, LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Russell Westbrook"
Hopefully Russell Westbrook.
"Russ averaged 27,7,12 in that playoff series vs Warriors . OKC only went up 3-1 because Russ was playing out of his mind, KD was doing his best to throw that series.  Klay went nuclear for 2 games and these guys are acting like Klay, a dude that can’t take three dribbles with the ball, is better than Russell Westbrook."
"Next year: ""The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to trade Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets. Russell Westbrook and James Harden were the driving forces in that trade, and Durant always wanted to play with both of them again."""
Chris paul and russell westbrook each led the league in assists multiple times...
"I've been listening to Bill Simmons before I knew who Ben Simmons was, but I'm going to start reading in Ben Simmons voice now. Imagining the cocky facial expressions too.   Reminds me how I used to confuse Russell Westbrook and Brian Westbrook."
LeBron 'Russell Westbrook' James
Alex Caruso is going to have more rings than James Harden and Russell Westbrook combined  Crazy
"Wouldn't have been an issue if we took Russell Westbrook over Michael Beasley lol. There's a universe out there where we did, where Lebron didn't make us sign and trade for him, and where we also drafted Butler with the 30th pick."
Russell Westbrook mixed with Kawhi
In 2015 Russell Westbrook was injured also lol. Whenever Russ was healthy he never missed the playoffs.
"But now he’s done it in the west and went through:  CJ Dame Old Melo Russell Westbrook James harden Jokic Murray   with no home court advantage after finishing as the number 1 seed, to get back to the finals.   Basically it boils down to this, Jordan stans point to lebrons weak conference opponents, LeBron stans point to Jordan’s weak finals opponents."
NBA Bubble jersey sales:  1. LeBron James 2. Luka Doncic 3. Anthony Davis 4. Jayson Tatum 5. Giannis A. 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kevin Durant 8. Damian Lillard 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Jimmy Butler  11. Kemba Walker 12. Kyrie Irving 13. Russell Westbrook 14. Nikola Jokic 15. Ja Morant
"If Bill regularly shits on a player, it's probably something personal like that (e.g. Russell Westbrook)."
"The trail of trail of tears was just brutal. Jackson ignored court rulings and forced Indians to vacate their land and head west. A good number died along the way, on top of losing their homes.   Woodrow Wilson literally wrote a textbook praising the KKK and Confederacy. The federal government also had integrated jobs at the time, but he got rid of it in favor of segregation. Here’s a quote from him:   &gt; “Segregation is not humiliating, but a benefit, and ought to be so regarded by you gentlemen.”  Then for Bush: he caused us a considerable amount of debt, destabilized the Middle East, started a war and had plenty of deaths on his hands for a made up story.   Don’t get me wrong, Trump sucks, but he’s just not on the same level as some of the other presidents. Starting a war for your oil buds in Texas, segregating the government, and killing a bunch of Indians after taking their homes wins out imo. Trump is the Russell Westbrook of sucking, while those guys are the LeBrons/Kawhis/KDs of it."
"Draymond Green to Russell Westbrook, I think."
A one Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook I guess.
"Russell Westbrook even in his current age is still in a different league athletically to prime J-Lin, and Russ has had several surgeries to his knees  Lou Will has been in the league for 15 years, sure he's a defensive liability but the man can get buckets however he wants. I'm not sure I can say the same for Lin whose outside shot veered from ""average"" to ""wtf man stop shooting"" throughout his career."
"Russell Westbrook. He seems like an incredible teammate that leaves it all on the floor every night. At least publicly the buck stops at him.   Of course he has flaws, personal and in his game, but he is very good and seems like a ride or die kinda guy."
"If MJ played in the modern NBA, he'd be a mix of James Harden and Russell Westbrook, but with mental toughness and 4' vert."
"I like Vernon. He has terrible takes sometimes (Russell westbrook) no doubt, but i find it refreshing to hear from someone that doesnt regurgitate the same thing as every other podcast I listen to and tweet I see"
And russell westbrook was all nba first team
What reality do you live in where Russell Westbrook has always gotten a pass? His haters are next level insane
"Bam out on the perimeter just means Dwight would give him the Ben Simmons/Russell Westbrook treatment and back off of him. There's no reason to guard him out there since he won't shoot it. And the Lakers are *fantastic* at recovering after switches are made. Just look at how quickly they were able to neutralize it when the Nuggets did that. You have to remember that even if you are able to pull Dwight out away from the basket, the Lakers still have AD and LeBron able to provide rim protection behind him."
"Zach Lowe: “When you get Russell Westbrook..Coaches will not get fired, draft picks/young players will forget how to shoot and not help him. But Westbrook will take you to the playoffs (barring any injuries). He will not win in the first round, he will have multiple blips in the series. That’s the payoff.”  This format fun lmao"
"When trying to decide who’s better, I try to isolate what the individual player can and can’t do, what are their skill sets and then I try to fit them into a team narrative (can this guy help a team win). You’re definition of better is equal to how I perceive value. Robinsons skill set makes him a much more valuable player across the league then Kuzma and I won’t argue that. but from what he can do as an individual I’d say Kuzma is a better player.   Would you say prime Klay Thompson is better then prime Russell Westbrook? Klay has always had more value towards a winning team but you wouldn’t argue he’s better then Westbrook as an individual player would you?  Robinson can be more valuable and contribute to winning more while Kuzma can be the better individual player. Both of those things can be true."
Exhibit A: Russell Westbrook
One last one because I think it is probably the best example:  Kevin Durant (32/7/6) and Russell Westbrook (22/6/7) vs an aging Tony Parker/Tim Duncan and the 2014 Spurs.
"Please find me one instance of Russell Westbrook regular season performance dropping off even close to the amount it did this year.   If this was any other player, people would actually use logic and give credit to the injury. But just because it’s Russ, the illogical hot takes are out."
Back when russell westbrook could shoot 83% from the line in a playoffs series
Russell Westbrook destroyed the value of a triple double. No one in soccer or hockey can go get a hat trick like Westbrook can get a triple double.
&gt;So little  Harden? Dwight Howard? Jeremy Lin? Chris Paul? Eric Gordon? Russell Westbrook?
the Paul George and Russell Westbrook trades were the GM equivalent of painting the Sistine Chapel. Those were not normal returns.
"Anderson Varejao, Mo Williams... that's all I got. Mostly from watching Mo chuck shots like a Russell Westbrook prototype."
* 3. LeBron James * 13. Stephen Curry * 36. Luka Doncic * 42. Anthony Davis * 43. Zion Williamson * 44. Giannis Antetokounmpo * 50. Russell Westbrook
"I agree that the league is more talented than ever, but there's still clearly lots of value in tanking. As an example, if you look at the All-NBA teams this year 60% were top six picks in their respective drafts. For most teams it's hard to get guys like these without tanking.  LeBron James (1)  Anthony Davis (1)  Ben Simmons (1)  James Harden (3)  Luka Doncic (3)  Jayson Tatum (3)  Chris Paul (4)  Russell Westbrook (4)  Damian Lillard (6)"
"How many people in real life have you ever heard use the phrase ""petulant child""? Then go into any Russell Westbrook thread."
"Better option than Paul George or Russell Westbrook imo, the two lesser parts of their own respective ""superstar duos""."
"It was more mutual with Westbrook and the organization as well. Presti traded for picks, it was obvious where the franchise was going. He made that decision knowing that the next step would be to trade Westbrook, and Russell was also ready to move on."
"&gt; Has tanking worked for anyone?   Seattle SuperSonics were rumored to have tanked for a couple of years to both get a good draft pick and suck enough to have a reason to move by having low attendance.  They did move, and sucked enough to get Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.  So, that worked out on both ends.  Rockets traded away Moses Malone in '82 to tank and got Ralph Samspson and and then Hakeem.    Cleveland tanked for LeBron."
"Derrick Rose won because of the narrative. I'd pick literally anyone that won MVP over the past 15 years over Derrick Rose. Yes, even Russell Westbrook"
"""Well, I guess we could get that stud Russell Westbrook once this is all over... But I think Pat prefers Michael Beasley so that's fine."""
"Russell Westbrook almost ruined Oladipo’s career tf. As soon as he left OKC he erupted as a rising star in the NBA. Russ used to shoot his team out of half their games, not to mention he can’t play that well in the clutch"
The Bucks were also a team that relied on Giannis to have an mvp performance every game but got turned into a bigger version of Russell Westbrook in the halfcourt.
They're all so much better than Russell Westbrook
"&gt;He was awful for most of the playoffs  If this is what makes you turn against a player, then have I got news for you about Russell Westbrook"
Ya and Russell Westbrook totally played like a top 15 player lmfao  This is why no one takes this this sub seriously  Talent doesn’t equal how good a team is  The heat for example have 0 maybe 1 top 10 player but did better agains the lakers than any other team did
"Russell Westbrook trick y'all, man, like he bringing the ball up the court. He don't bring no basketball up, man. He just falling down, doing nothing."
"Derrick Rose, Tony Parker, Steve Nash, Deron Williams, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, John Wall &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"
Dude you’re not gonna convince anyone that Kevin Durant being flanked by Steph Curry and Klay Thompson is the same thing as Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka in OKC.
It's going to be Russell Westbrook.
Good player? I don't like Snek either but only LeBron is better than him. To join the 73-9 warriors with their two time MVP and still be able the man is something Kawhi could not have done.   KD played with the most ball dominant player of the last few years in Russell Westbrook and still got his with high efficiency. Bruh don't let the snek move fool you. Just cuz he's a dick doesn't mean you should forget he's an all time great. Kawhi is not. It's like people calling LeBron trash becaue he joined the heat.
"I thought it was genuine and made me like Morey more. Props to him giving Harden praise and really highlighting the effect that he has had on Morey’s career. I also liked that he shouted out future hall of famers he was involved with: CP3, Dwight and Russell Westbrook."
Cam Newton and Russell Westbrook.   Both won MVPs  Both freaks of nature for their positions  Both immensely talented players who sometimes have lapses in judgement during games but still have an overwhelmingly positive impact on the game despite what some blog boi says  Both dress weird  Both of them get shit on them at a disproportionately ridiculous level any time they have a bad game  Both made exactly one Super Bowl so far and lost it  Both are probably top 10 favorite athletes of mine all time (Cam being #2 behind only Kemba)
Russell Westbrook for Danny Green ^^^^^and ^^^^^Anthony ^^^^^Davis  Who says no?
"Honestly, Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul are Superstars too, even if their game is not the same anymore. I think they got that reputation"
With LeBron playing in the West now that's not going to hold up. Just this year alone LeBron played   - Damian Lillard - James Harden - Russell Westbrook - Nikola Jokic  - Jamal Murray
"Chris Paul, Paul George. Paul Paul.  George Gervin, Paul George. George George.  Davis Bertans, Anthony Davis. Davis Davis   Leonard Taylor, Meyers Leonard. Leonard Leonard  James Harden, Lebron James. James James   Chris Webber, Marquess Chriss. Chris Chriss  Russell Westbrook, Dangelo Russell. Russell Russell  Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley. Bradley Bradley  Duncan Robinson, Tim Duncan. Duncan Duncan  Christian Wood, Bob Christian. Christian Christian."
Steph curry/steve nash or Russell westbrook? Ill take the man who can shoot and pass. Russ is an undersized sf
"There’s a simple reason to take on either Paul OR Westbrook. You’ll win games. The Knicks with Chris Paul or Westbrook would at BEST be a 40 win team. But that’s significantly better than what they have been for the Past 3 seasons. And with the bottom of the east being as WEAK as it is at the moment, they could even potentially make the playoffs as an 8th seed.. And winning is the easiest way to get fans interested and hyped up for their future. This season will almost certain be fanless, but winning games will do wonders for the Knicks tv ratings. Plus having a star on the Knicks is an easy way to sell a ton of jerseys/merch.  Getting a Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook will at best elevate the Knicks to mediocrity and a first round sweep. But it builds ALOT of interest in Knicks fans for their future. Which at this point the Knicks need, especially given How shit they’ve been for the past years."
"&gt; Harden never had his version of Draymond Green, much less Durant  But that's really the rub, isn't it?  Draymond was a second round pick in the draft, Morey had ample opportunity to pick up Draymond himself, let alone a just version of him.    With the admittedly huge exception of KD, the Warriors didn't win championships by going over the luxury tax, they went over the luxury tax because their players became stars as they piled up championships.      The question with Morey is why didn't his system identify another Draymond Green?   During the Morey era, the Warriors used middling draft picks and a first-time coach to build a dynasty.  Morey's most successful draft pick was, I don't know, maybe Clint Capela?      &gt; The Rockets never paired Harden with a frontcourt player who could be the focal point of the offense.  This seems obviously wrong to me.   Harden was paired with superstars CP3 and Russell Westbrook.  If that's the wrong pairing for Harden, the fault lies with the GM, not the budget.     I like Morey and I like the metrics, and he definitely had a level of success most teams would be happy with.  But you can't talk about the monetary limitations without mentioning that the greatest dynasty of his era started with the same limitations.      And it's worth remembering that Morey never had a truly successful draft pick, definitely had picks where he missed obvious talent, and had a number of famously bad trades.    There's a real limit to the way that Morey used metrics."
That's better than acquiring Russell Westbrook tbh
"So let me get this straight - the Knicks are interested in FVV, Chris Paul, and Russell Westbrook? What are the odds they strike out and win the Cam Payne sweepstakes lol"
"I don’t dislike LeBron, he’s just not my favorite player. I have my reservations about him but my favorite player is fucking Russell Westbrook so it’s not like I look for perfection out of my favorites. I like to think I would stand firm as a non-worshipper if he came to OKC, but admittedly I would probably like him a lot more if he did."
"I hate Russell Westbrook.  I think he exemplifies everything that is wrong with basketball, and sports honestly.  He is insanely selfish, attention-seeking, possibly the most immature player in the league, throws tantrums on the court, is generally rude and abrasive to media who are just trying to do their jobs.  He tunnels harder than any player I've ever seen, including Kobe ""get out of the way"" Bryant, he has the worst shot selection this side of Antoine Walker, and he never seems to truly take responsibility for the losses the team inevitably accumulates when he goes 5-17, 6-23, or goes 3-17 in a single QUARTER of a playoff game.  And can we talk about a guy who shoots from 30 feet with 14 seconds left on the shot clock? Sure he makes them occasionally... like 1 in 8 tries, if that.  He's a hard worker? Sure. When he has the ball in his hand, or when he's hunting for a stat. If there's not a box score change in it for him, he essentially dozes off on the court for long stretches of time, even if it means leaving Steph Curry wide open.  So yeah. I hate Westbrook. I think he is an impossibly selfish star who cares more about individual accolades than playing the game the right way. I think he's a childish, angry man who begs for the limelight only to scoff at it to show how edgy he is like some kind of 17 year old who hates their parents when they're in public. I think he represents a facet of the game that's on display every time you go to your local Y and there's a former DI college player who's more athletic than everyone else in the gym and takes 20 shots in a game to 11, while only passing the ball when he's falling down, out of control, with no ability to chuck a shot at the rim because at this point he's getting triple teamed by the other squad who's up by 8 points and is laughing at his errant faith that his 25 foot heave is a better shot than a teammate who's wide open.  At the end of the day, Westbrook is a guy who has been given every fucking gift in the world to be a monster star of the sport, and he only uses that to chase triple doubles and personal glory. It's not all about ego, either. LeBron has a huge ego, obviously, but look at how vastly different their leadership is of the team. The Thunder fans want to blame every single player and every single coach except the guy who's the MVP and supposed to be leading them, which is an entire other post that just reflects poorly on how Westbrook could take 80 shots in a game and fans would defend him endlessly for it.  It's funny how so few of the truly great players of the sport need excuses about teammates to be made for them."

"Nba Analyst here, Ican confirm that is not Russell Westbrook."
"Mom: ""we have James Harden and Russell Westbrook at home"""
Why is William Howard the first picture you see for Russell Westbrook??!?!
Mom: We have Russell Westbrook at home.
I'm just saying have you ever seen Russell Westbrook and that guy in the same room?
That ain't Russell Westbrook. I think Ive seen him on the old television.
You just have Russell Westbrook blindness. Horses have it too.
He's The New Russell Westbrook for State Farm
"Idk what you’re talking about, that man is obviously Russell westbrook (lol maybe he’s been playing so poorly he’s turning into a Walmart version)"
"over 9 threes at a 0.316 is really bad bro, that's Russell Westbrook level of efficiency on 3s, 0.361 is around league avg which is good, especially at trae's volume which is also at around 9 threes a game - huge difference, not to mention I imagine trae's threes are more contested/difficult given how worse his team is compared to luka's, luka is more efficient on 2s though, he's amazing at the rim"
Russell Westbrook
It’s the new Russell Westbrook
"“Is Russell Westbrook healthy?”  Judging by the pic, I don’t think he is. Lol."
Who is this “James Harden”???   https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=Russell+Westbrook&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#imgdii=J6PaU7QExVONpM&amp;imgrc=qpRg4KBEgZHqoM
There’s also a James Harden in the related images hahaha   https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=Russell+Westbrook&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#imgdii=J6PaU7QExVONpM&amp;imgrc=qpRg4KBEgZHqoM  I have Noooooooooo idea who that is it looks like pat bev mixed with Greg oden
Like this one for “James Harden?”  [Who dis?!](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=Russell+Westbrook&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#imgdii=J6PaU7QExVONpM&amp;imgrc=qpRg4KBEgZHqoM)
the universe where William Howard and Michael Frazier are the MVP-winning all-star starters for the Houston Rockets and James Harden and Russell Westbrook are mostly-anonymous 3rd stringers on 2-ways.
I was driving through Maine today where I didn't have reception and I turned on Westbrook street. This made me ponder for about an hour whether it was Russell Westbrook or Russell Westbook with no way of knowing for sure.
This is Harden LOL https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=Russell+Westbrook&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#imgdii=J6PaU7QExVONpM&amp;imgrc=qpRg4KBEgZHqoM
"He also played next to Russell Westbrook, who was a borderline or legitimate MVP-level player during Durant's time there. It's not like he played next to bums who demanded no defensive attention."
Gonna pass on Pick 8 and Frank for Russell Westbrook but appreciate the effort
Ah they messed up the photo. That’s Russell Westbrook
"why didn't playing russell westbrook work?  because he couldn't dribble, pass, or shoot at all.  kinda have to do one of those semi-competently to help the team."
That's when you order Russell Westbrook off Wish
LMFAO this is hilarious    https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=Russell+Westbrook&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8
"BREAKING: The Houston Rockets have agreed in principle to trade Russell Westbrook to the Brooklyn Nets for Caris Lavert, Deandre Jordan, and Taurean Prince. Sources say Kevin Durant was driving force behind trade"
Would you rather have Robert Covington or Russell Westbrook on the Sixers?
"Timberwolves could do a Russell swap along with some assets? KAT and Westbrook sounds like a weird, interesting combo to me where you have a PG driving and shooting twos while feeding a big man who can shoot 3s."
Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double with the least bit of team ball I’ve ever seen. Assists do not mean team oriented
&gt;Russell Westbrook doesn't seem to be struggling to much.  Did you watch the playoffs at all or na?
Whatever helps you sleep at night. Russell Westbrook doesn't seem to be struggling to much. He is a smaller and less talented Jordan with an even worse jumper.
Tim Duncan   Moses Malone   Russell Westbrook   Clyde Drexler   Michael Olowukandi
"The 12 players I got: Dwight, Kris Humphries, Karl Malone, Jason Collins, Jeremy Lin, Drummond, Amar'e Stoudemire, Dwight F. Davis, JR Smith, Bernard King, Ben Wallace, Russell Westbrook  My starting 5: Westbrook, JR Smith, Bernard King, Malone, Dwight"
"Knicks receive: Russell Westbrook  Houston receives: 47 power forwards, a copy of JD &amp; The Straight Shot greatest hits, autographed (twist: this is just a blank CD)."
"&gt;CP3 is one of the most analytics friendly players in the league. Every team he's been on has outperformed with him on the team.  I’m not certain this is even an analytically-minded way of viewing CP3. Like I’m sure Bill Russell in 1965 could have watched CP3 play an important game and know that he was a winning player. He is both analytically and classically good. You don’t need impact stats, player tracking, and a huge sample to know CP3 has what it takes to elevate a good team or that Westbrook plays like the exact converse."
"russell westbrook imo, he isn't an elite defender and can't space the floor. I don't think he could be the main point guard on a contender, I think he would need a second guy who can also facilitate like harden. But he still hurts any team he's on since he isn't effective without the ball in his hands. At least with gobert he can protect the rim at an elite level, which is important for a contender. Russ doesn't bring anything that important to a contender that I would make me take him over lowry or jrue."
"A ball dominant big who can’t play defense or a ball dominant guard who can’t shoot. KAT isn’t ball dominant enough to fit the first, but he doesn’t play d. Russell Westbrook fits the second, if he’s still considered a star."
"Clippers have a leader.... it's Pat Bev ya'll lmao. He represents the Clippers and Kawhi and PG let him get there. Why do you think Pat Bev is so comfortable in a losing culture? Why do you think he acts like he is one of the leaders of the team?  Every franchise has a guy that the players sort of follow in terms of display. The Clippers legitimately let Pat Bev be their ""face"" in social media AND general media. They let him talk that talk all over and look at them now.  ""He tricked ya'll"" - Russell Westbrook"
You will never get anywhere with Russell Westbrook on your team.  Taking that contract was a death sentence.  Harden will waste away his sexy years next to RW.
"This kind of attitude is how teams stay in the basement.  There is absolutely no good reason to tie up your cap space with Russell Westbrook   He is due $133 mil over the next 3 years ($44 mil/yr) .  On top of that he is about to turn 32 years old , just had his worst season since becoming a star 10 years ago, and has an injury history that continues to pile up   He's not a negative impact player (yet) , but there is *much* better use of like 40% of your cap space than wasting it on Russell Westbrook"
"Not Russell Westbrook related, but why didn't the Knicks go after D'Angelo Russell after missing out on KD last summer? I heard these ridiculous potential trade rumors such as Dlo for Portis, Trier, and Ntilikina. Like if you wanted a decent player why wouldn't you just go for him last summer rather than the debacle of signings they did."
"But they'll get a \*really\* good deal if they're  ♫ paying Russell Westbrook ♫ , though!"
"The follow-up tweet is the key answer:  &gt; Jeff Van Gundy remains a co-finalist in Houston and was still talking to the Rockets today after their initial interview Wednesday  &gt; But Lucas, league sources say, has at least three key admirers in the organization: James Harden, Russell Westbrook and new Rockets GM Rafael Stone  &gt; https://twitter.com/thesteinline/status/1316827773479071751?s=21"
"I'm not trying to insinuate anything could be an honest mistake by OP.   But the words he used ""Knicks looking to potentially trade for Russell Westbrook"" was not used in the tweet or article. It does IMO misrepresent the reporter because it makes it sound bigger than what the story is.  Agents can and do say whatever they want about their client to increase their perceived value. So it could be something or just normal offseason nonsense.  But words do matter though, and in my opinion makes it sound like theirs a source within the Knicks, which again isn't what the reporter said .   OP clarifies in the comment yes, but the title I think is poor."
what the article actually says:  “some agents who represent top point guard free agents believe the Knicks would poke around on a potential Russell Westbrook trade if Houston makes him available”  this is practically nothing lol
CBS Sports had a story yesterday talking about the Knicks getting impatient and star chasing again.  Prominently mentioned as a target: Russell Westbrook lol.
"They wouldn't, the actual quote means that we'd need more assets than just Russell Westbrook.  Also it says we're looking into CP3"
"""I don't really see us having a 'head' GM. KD could be a head GM, I could be a head GM (some days)."" - Not Russell Westbrook"
"Here's the actual quote  &gt;One more note as you look ahead to draft night: my guess is that what happens leading up to the draft will impact **New York’s plans that night. If the club makes a trade with Oklahoma City for Chris Paul, that will probably change their thinking heading into Nov. 18.**  &gt;Something else to keep an eye on: **some agents who represent top point guard free agents believe the Knicks would poke around on a potential Russell Westbrook trade if Houston makes him available.** It’s worth noting that Westbrook, per sources, saw New York as a welcome landing spot last summer when Oklahoma City was talking to teams about potential trades.  &gt;Westbrook’s work ethic and drive would have an impact on New York’s young players. But the deal -- just like a potential Paul trade -- would obviously have to make sense for New York. If they are going to take on Westbrook’s contract (three years remaining, third year is a player option, $132 million in total), you’d think that the Knicks would look for an **additional asset from Houston.**"
"Yeah great idea, let's put Russell Westbrook in the team with the worst spacing in the league lol.   Love Russ but after one year of absence this will be the return of Russell ""Imma take 8 pull up 3's per game"" Westbrook"
"People take for granted the fact that the NBA doesn't just have good athletes, they probably have some of THE BEST all-around athletes in the world.     It's hard to imagine a sport that Giannis, Lebron, Russell Westbrook ... hell, Demar Derozan ... couldn't dominate in, if they tried.      Like, if each WNBA team had a Serena Williams on it, it would probably be a lot more watchable."
Russell Westbrook shoots 80%
I wonder how that guy feels about Alex Caruso starting in more championship clinching games (1) than James Harden (0) and Russell Westbrook (0) combined
Just saying even without those 7 and it wasn't that bad. People are acting like he shot 25% (russell westbrook and lou williams)
Or Dwyane Wade vs. Russell Westbrook.
literally everyone quoted russell westbrook when talking about pat bev. sorry that i hurt your feelings for doing a meme
"Starters PG	Russell Westbrook	17 SG	Bogdan Bogdonovic	10 SF	Joe Harris	8 PF	Jonathan Issac	15 C	Karl Anthony-Towns	36 		 Bench 5		 PG	John Wall	10 SG	Jordan Clarkson	5 SF	Cedi Osman	3 PF	Bobby Portis	5 C	Dwight Howard	3 		 Bench - Misc.		 Nicolas Batum	2	JaMychal Green	6  I made another, I chose a random player to build around and it ended up being KAT. I decided I wasn't allowed to use any players I'd already used"
KJ was so explosive in his time. it wouldn't be like sending back russell westbrook but that's probably his closest style comp to me based on what I've seen of his pre-injury days.
Lol his head still is reaching the rim and full sprint he's up the court in seconds he's not Russell Westbrook or de'aaron fox but he is still fast especially for someone his age
That's a lot of really intelligent basketball players plus russell westbrook
"People don't think about fit *at all*, that's how you ended up with this entire subreddit thinking the Sixers would be a great team with a starting lineup of Embiid/Horford/Harris/Richardson/Simmons.   There's a very good argument to be made that if you swapped AD with Tim Duncan on this year's Lakers team they get worse. In the first round AD was meeting Dame Lillard at the level of the screen close to halfcourt, second round he was defending Russell Westbrook, third round he was switching out on to Jamal Murray, Finals he was roving between Jimmy Butler and Bam."
Assistant Coach Mark Jackson's pre-season team report:  James Harden: GREATNESS.    Russell Westbrook: GREATNESS.    PJ Tucker: GREATNESS.    Robert Covington: GREATNESS.    Eric Gordon: GREATNESS.         Team Needs: MORE GREATNESS.
"First trade idea is if the Bulls randomly say ""Fuck it we are all in this year""  •Bulls trade Lauri Markkane, Thad Young, and Tomas Satoransky   •Thunder trade CP3  Why Bulls make this trade: Billy Donovan had one of his best coaching performances when he had CP3 on the Thunder. The two seemed to have a good working relationship. Adding CP3 adds some much needed veteran leadership, gives Coby White more time to develop, and probably most importantly it would allow Zack LaVine to play SG. Offensively I think the two could make a great pairing.  Why the Thunder do this: Thunder receive a young player with lots of potential in the modern NBA player style. I think getting a player like Markkane for Paul is a best case scenario for them. While Satoransky and Thad Young are mostly filler the two could help strengthen the lineup a bit if the Thunder want to try and continue to stay competitive while rebuilding.    Trade number 2 is more of a fun ""what if"" if the Rockets decided to blow it up and start over. By no means do I think they should do this and I don't think they ever will.    •Rockets receive:  -John Wall, 2020 2nd round pick, 2021 1st round pick (top 3 protected) from the Wizards -Victor Olidipo, Myles Turner, 2021, 2023, 2025 first round picks from the Pacers -Zhaire Smith, Matisse Thybulle, and Furkan Korkmaz from the 76ers  •Wizards receive Russell Westbrook  •Pacers receive James Harden  •Sixers receive Robert Covigton, Danuel House Jr, and Ben McLemore   Why this trade doesn't happen: like I said I don't think the Rockets should do this and I don't think they would either. The Rockets have been one of the best teams in the West for a while now and with the right free agent signings this off-season I don't see that changing. And to put it simply you don't trade a top 5 player like Harden away unless he's forcing his way out. But if they did blow it up they could do much worse. They get several first round picks, a few solid young players from the Sixers with decent potential, Myles Turner who's still young and can develop further. They could also trade Turner and Dipo at the trade deadline for a few more picks or young players if they play well and have no desire to keep Turner during their rebuilding phase.   Obviously the Pacers would and should do this trade in a heart beat as they would instantly become one of the title favorites.   I think the Sixers do this trade as well as it adds much needed depth and shooting to their team.   The hardest team to sell on this trade besides the Rockets would be the Wizards. They would essentially be trading an overpaid player for an overpaid. I do think this is an upgrade just for the fact that Westbrook is much more healthy and we have no idea what kind of player Wall will be after is major injuries."
"Here are three examples (there are more but I don't want to spend time digging it up because pretending Westbrook doesn't display good leadership is ignorant at this point)  Former teammate Jerami Grant on if he has played with anybody with a leadership style like Jordan's: (https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/06/12/jerami-grant-leadership-of-russell-westbrook-reminiscent-of-jordan/) &gt;For sure, Russell Westbrook. He always lit a fire under me.  &gt;I was very timid. My confidence was wishy washy. I had just gotten traded, and he would pass me the ball, and I wouldn’t shoot it sometimes. I’d be hesitant. He always screamed at me, ‘Shoot the effing ball!’ For me, that’s why he’s my brother. Me and Russ are extremely close. He definitely sees potential in me, and he felt like I could help the team win. For him to do stuff like that, I love it. He’s just trying to help me. Russ definitely has that mentality.  &gt;I didn’t take it personally. I think Jordan was a little different. Jordan was a little more aggressive. From watching the documentary, it was a little more spiteful. Russ was more constructive criticism. It was a tough-love type thing. If he really felt like you had the potential, he was going to push you in his way. I never really took to it in the wrong way, because I knew that it helped me to move forward.   Current teammate James Harden: (https://www.talkbasket.net/101465-james-harden-on-russell-westbrook-he-is-our-leader)  &gt; Obviously, he is our leader and we all know what he does for the game of basketball, for our team, so it was exciting to have him out there,” Harden Said, via James Jackson of The Oklahoman.  Shams Charania: (https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2873032-rockets-rumors-russell-westbrook-taking-on-leadership-role-in-locker-room)  &gt; Per The Athletic's Shams Charania, Westbrook has emerged as a vocal leader in Houston's locker room in his first season with the team:  &gt;""Westbrook joined [James] Harden's team in Houston, with Harden serving as the main usage star, but recently it has been Westbrook who has taken the initiative within the locker room. At practices and with pre- and postgame setting and everything in between, Westbrook has delivered a succinct message to the Rockets, league sources tell The Athletic:  &gt;""'We need to play together and be committed to winning—get out of our individual feelings and have no agendas.'  &gt;""He has said this unabashed to all teammates in the hope of building the proper habits as the season wears on.""  &gt;Charania noted Westbrook ""wants badly to win"" and has delivered ""several passionate messages"" to his teammates."
"How is Westbrook a good leader? What has he done to make you think that? Who has come out and vocally said that Russell has great leadership skills? There's a difference between being a leader by example like Russ is and being an actual team leader.  For example, for the Heat, Butler led by example and yes, was in people's ears, but Udonis Haslem, despite barely playing, was also considered a locker room leader.  Another example - Kobe was the on-court leader for the Lakers and set the tone, but the leadership balance in the locker room for his teams were often by guys like Derek Fisher, or Phil Jackson, Ron Harper, etc."

"He also only has 2 rings against direct competition (Russell) so he falls short. Wilt is what people think Westbrook is (not that he isn't one), a stat padder. Doesn't mean he's not amazing, but I've heard enough to where it seems like the guy cared less about winning and more about his own box score, at least in the first half of his career.  And honestly outside of his 50ppg season, those scoring numbers aren't THAT impressive to me. Like relative to normal players it is obviously, but not in comparison to other greats. Somehow he still ended up with ""only"" 30ppg in his career. And his rebounding numbers look much better than they are. % wise he's still around what Rodman and Drummond are. And while the ""milkmen"" argument is annoying, the average size of players in the modern league is 2 inches taller and 20+ lbs heavier. He's still fucking amazing and would be great in any era, but his career has turned into some sort of mythos. He's a physical anomaly at any point in time, but even more so back then and still only got it done twice with those gaudy stats, with one of them being at the tail end. Something don't add up. I get that what I wasn't there to witness it, but really very few were and still alive to tell about it.  Basically, yeah he has no room at the table lol."
"Saying you can't win with him is one thing, you can argue that I won't fight you too hard for it agree to disagree, saying Russell Westbrook doesn't care about winning is just completly dumb"
"KD deserves more shit for blowing a 3-1 lead over the Warriors. If Lebron or Tim Duncan had Russell Westbrook as their number 2, they would've steamrolled the entire league for years and years like Kobe and Shaq."
"Using regular season averages when rating Russell fucking Westbrook. This is amazing, just peak nephew shit.  Westbrook is shit in the *playoffs*. You know, the games that actually matter? Any good team would take Beal or (healthy) Klay over WB, even teams that already have a good SG. Including the Rockets BTW, Klay is like Morey's wet dream. Only shit teams that need a heroballer to drag them to the playoffs and who would be ok with losing in five games in the first round while their star chucks up bad shots would pick WB.  And there is no debate with Luka you absolute clown. Lmfao if it's debatable then go ahead and lay out your evidence as to why literally every educated fan and pundit might be wrong for ranking Luka miles ahead of Russ."

Russell westbrook in shambles
At least I’m not putting my entire championship dreams on James fucking Harden lol. And then thinking the solution to James Harden being trash in the playoffs would be Russell fucking Westbrook lmfao
"So in your mind, KD joining the already-champion, best-record-in-the-league team that just kicked his ass, while leaving a quality teammate behind (Russell Westbrook) is not a bitch move . . .   But AD wanting to leave a trash ass team to go to the Lakers (who had been doing just OK at the time) is a bitch move?  Warriors fans mental gymnastics are too too crazy."
"How does a mvp of the nba have low bbiq? Referring to Russell Westbrook. Statements like these are kinda dumb, you know how, they have a low bbiq."
So Russell Westbrook?
"2012 and 2013 was pretty ridiculous, Kobe, Wade, Cp3, Rondo, Dwill, james harden, Russell westbrook and tony parker were the All-NBA guards that was definitely not weaker than today where Klay Thompson can make All-NBA putting up 21/3/3"
"Just imagine Westbrook as both teams, the fans, the refs, with one regular guy as a commentator.  ""Russell Westbrook with the Jam! Oh, Russell Westbrook seems to be yelling at a Russell Fanbrook in the bleachers! Russell Westbrook tries to calm him down but Russell Westbrook keeps jawing at the fan! Reffel Westbrook Ts up Russel Westbrook and ejects him from the game!!! Oh my, now the Russel Benchbrooks are rushing Russel Fanbrook while coach Russ argues with Reffel Westbrook over the technical call! Meanwhile 2 other Westbrooks have gotten into a fistfight after having and 'And 1' shouting contest! At the other end of the court there's 3 more Westbrooks missing shots so the others can stat pad their rebounds! What a 1st quarter this has been!!!!"""
"These are some arguments, but they don't come close to accounting for the whole picture.   If you look at their achievements side by side, Oscar has clearly achieved more in his career.  Oscar Robertson:  * **1x NBA Champion** * **1x MVP** * **9x Top5 in MVP Voting** * **12x All-Star** * **11x All-NBA** * **9x All-NBA 1st Team** * 0x Scoring leader * **6x Assists Leader**  Russell Westbrook  * 0x NBA Champion * **1x MVP** * 4x Top5 in MVP Voting * 9x All-Star * 9x All-NBA * 2x All-NBA 1st Team * **2x Scoring Leader** * 2x Assist Leader  The crux of your argument really is that Oscar played in a weaker league. That's the only thing that could account for putting Westbrook over him, as Robertson was pretty clearly the more successful NBA player.  And you can look at that and in that way invalidate a lot of all time greats (Wilt, Russell, West, Baylor, Reed, etc), but then you're really only arguing who the better player was, not who the greater player was. And you're comparing people who played in completely different circumstances two very different sports even.  Now as for some of your other arguments:  &gt;won MVP in arguably the closest MVP race ever with 3-4 viable candidates  It certainly wasn't the closest race ever.  Regardless, I don't see how a close race is an advantage for Westbrook. A dominant landslide win is much more impressive.   When Oscar won his MVP, the 2nd and 3rd highest vote-getters were Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. He had to go against these guys in an MVP race year after year.  &gt;3 triple double seasons. Pace was much higher in Oscar's and they played almost the same teams every night.  Yeah if we're going with who was better at getting triple doubles, this is an actual argument. But when ranking them all time, don't see how it's relevant. Oscar could easily have averaged a TD in two more seasons if he was trying to.   &gt;2x assist title ahead of all-time great passers like CP3 and LeBron. I'm aware Oscar has 6 in a less competitive league.  Assist titles aren't directly related to passing ability. No one in their right mind would argue that Westbrook is a better passer than these two. LeBron only has a single assist title in his career.  And as you said, Oscar has 6, which comes down to the main point - the only actual argument is that Oscar played a long time ago.  &gt;most athletic PG ever  Don't see what that has to do with greatness. Athleticism is an attribute that helps you impact games, but the actual impact is the only thing that counts.  &gt;best rebounder at that position ever  Maybe, I'm not sure.   &gt;Oscar only won when he had a top 3-5 player on his team.  And Westbrook didn't win when he had a top 3-5 player on his team, so I don't see how that's an argument for him.   &gt;In fact, his TS% dropped from RS to Playoffs in the year they won.  Westbrook's TS% dropped from RS to Playoffs in the year they made the Finals. It also dropped from RS to Playoffs in both years they made the Conference Finals.  In all three of these years, Westbrook's TS% dropped by a larger margin than Oscar's did in '71.  Again I don't see how this could possibly be something that you view as a fact that's in WB's favor. In fact, the whole efficiency argument is heavily in Oscar's favor.  Robertson has a much higher TS% in both the regular season and the Playoffs  than Westbrook even in a vacuum, and especially compared to league average. He lead the league in playoff efficiency in three different seasons, and once in the regular season.    Robertson put up seasons and postseasons with 58%TS+ in a league where the average was less than 50%.   Westbrook on the other hand is averaging 51%TS in the postseason for his career. It's a comparison of one of the most efficient superstars ever to one of the least efficient.   To sum it up, I think there's an argument to make that Westbrook is the better player (though that's extremely hard to properly asses), but there's really no argument for Westbrook as the greater player, or for Westbrook being higher on the All-Time list."
"I don't believe that Russell Westbrook contributes to winning as much as Damian Lillard.  2017: Yes, Westbrook's stats were amazing and that was an impressive carry job. We think of the 2017 Thunder as being a one-man team, but they had Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, both of whom looked mediocre alongside Westbrook and became all-stars once they left.  2018: Now he has Paul George on his team, and they still get bounced in the first round by a rookie Donovan Mitchell.  2019: Paul George finished third in MVP voting. Westbrook had won MVP two seasons prior. In the first round they didn't just lose, but they got dominated by Damian Lillard who didn't have a single all-star teammate.  Year after year, Russell Westbrook underachieves in the playoffs. At what point do we have enough evidence that his style of play does not translate to winning?"
2016 Houston was the eight seed can’t expect a win there  2017 I admit it was a severe underperformance by harden especially game 6 2018 harden is the only one who gets blamed for losing to the Kd warriors makes no sense he didn’t have his cp3 in two games this is the year cp3 was amazing 2019 u say u can’t make an excuse for losing that’s true but harden still didn’t underperform  Cp3 should have stepped up  2020 harden showed up Russell Westbrook just wasn’t the same after injury
"1. Steph Curry 2. Chris Paul 3. Damian Lillard 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Kyrie Irving 6. John Wall 7. Kyle Lowry 8. Rajon Rondo 9. Tony Parker 10. Mike Conley  HM: Holiday, Kemba, Dragic, IT"
"I think a good indicator for casual fans is jersey sales. This was the list for top jersey sales in 2020:   LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers   Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks   Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers   Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks   Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors   Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets   Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers   Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers   Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat   Kemba Walker, Boston Celtics   Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets   Russell Westbrook, Houston Rockets   Nikola Jokić, Denver Nuggets   Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies   Literally none of these are inefficient scorers that don’t do much else."
Yall need Russell Westbrook. Get swept first round but at least you'd probably be there
"I want to see this iteration of the Rockets compete in the playoffs with a fully healthy, 100% Russell Westbrook. The Russell we got in the playoffs last year simply wasn't nearly as good as regular season Russell Westbrook. Regular season Russell was having the most efficient stretch of his entire career, arguably as good or maybe even better than his MVP season. He was destroying teams. His production didn't fall off in the playoffs because of choking, it was because of an injury he had suffered just before the playoffs. You could tell it was still effecting him greatly. If we run it back with a fully healthy Russ, and still don't get close to a championship, then I would be open to the conversation of blowing it up and sending these guys off to contenders. Until that happens, I feel it's a bit early to have conversations about blowing things up."
"I'm surprised and delighted that no one has mentioned Derrick Rose yet.  Based on the traditional standards of MVP voting (best offensive player on one of the best teams) he definitely deserved it that year.  A lot of the complaints about the MVP award are based on individual stats but ignore team wins.  Russell Westbrook was an exception to the rule because he broke a record most people considered unbreakable, averaging a triple double for a season.  But his stats were deceptive and I still think James Harden should have won that year."
"That's crazy I googled it and you're right -   From Woj: The Oklahoma City Thunder have agreed to trade Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets for Chris Paul, first-round picks in 2024 and 2026, pick swaps in 2021 and 2025, league sources tell ESPN.  AND Chris's contract is 1 year shorter... I hope morey doesnt do things like this for the sixers"
"True, but just because you work hard to achieve something doesn't mean you don't also have a natural aptitude for it that extends beyond your peers. You'll often hear greats across all sports talk about how, when they're truly locked in, the game seems to slow down. You can't teach that no matter how hard you try. Furthermore there are certain biological gifts that elites rely upon that are unteachable. Russell Westbrook will never be able to just teach someone else his explosiveness even though for him it often feels as simple as ""see spot, get to spot"". That explanation would do little to help someone without his physical prowess despite the fact that, for him, and the 0.01% of people with the genetic makeup to do what he does, it makes perfect sense."
"T-Mac would get blasted by fans in today's NBA. We've seen the hate that Paul George gets for being inefficient/bricking with his shot but McGrady was even worse. Also consider the hate that Russell Westbrook gets for his lack of playoff wins, McGrady was even worse than that as he literally never won a series. He'd be an easy target for sure.      The 2003 season was incredible but the 2004 season by T-Mac was the absolute epitome of empty stats.      He won the scoring title in 2004 on a 22 win team (after starting the season with 19 losses from his first 20 games) and had the following quote when the season finished and he got traded to Houston. **“If I had been on a bad team and had a bad year statistically, then you would have seen my image collapse. I had to lead the league (in scoring).”**. Sounds like statpadding to me as he shot 42% from the field (on 24 shots a game) and had a TS of just 52%"
"Russell Westbrook is the greatest Thunder player of all time. He's not the best, though."
Houston trades harden for giannis to pair with russell westbrook.
Russell Westbrook won it as a 6th seed because he got credit for carrying a terrible team. LeBron carried a *way* worse team while playing all 82 games.
"can't wait for tomorrow tho, gonna have a huge Russell Westbrook day celebration!"
"That is such a dumb argument lol. “Replace a better player with a worse player, and that team would be worse” lol. Replace steph curry with Russell Westbrook and those warriors teams never go anywhere. Replace Kobe with Paul pierce and those laker teams don’t go anywhere   It’s almost like...having a better player as opposed to a lesser player is good for the team? Who’d have thunk it"
"This was a smart move by Presti, and it makes sense now why PG signed in OKC so quickly without even meeting with other teams. Presti has built a reputation of trust and communication with players (Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook have both praised him for this too). Presti is basically the reason why the Thunder’s team culture is so well respected."
"&gt; Russ has been happy just being Russ  Well damn how’d you know? I was out here thinking Russell westbrook would only be happy if he was Reggie Miller.  But jokes aside, the dude has an insane work ethic. It shows in his athleticism. To maintain takes extreme amounts of time, and Russ has shown he’s willing to preserve his most lethal weapon throughout his career."
I remember the last Russell Westbrook day like it was yesterday
&gt;Who is Russell Westbrook to you?  Ricky Rubio's son
"I see him as an all-time great talent with obvious flaws. But having watched all of his games for over a decade, he can’t play any other way. If he took his foot off the gas for one second he wouldn’t be Russell Westbrook.   Sometimes that means you lose games you should have won. But that also means that sometimes you win games you should have lost.   All I know is, without a doubt, he’s one of the best athletes we’ve ever seen in any sport. His relentlessness is what’s special about him and he truly honest to god lives by his “Why Not” motto. One thing you can never say about Russ is that he isn’t entertaining🤷‍♂️ people can hate him but I had a fucking blast watching him for so long."
"It's the okc mayor, and he did make every day Russell Westbrook day; but just that one day, the one time was Paul George day.  Happy Russell Westbrook day btw."
"Probably some drama queen who thinks the only thing important about basketball is scoring more points than your opponent. What happened to guys like Allen Iverson and Russell Westbrook, those are some dudes who understood that style and looking cool is way more important than actually winning the game."
Russell Westbrook and Blake Griffin would dominate the 50s 60s and 70s as a duo
"Duncan Robinson is one of the best of the best 3 point shooters, that's why he was in the 3 Point contest.  I'd rather watch him compete in a 3 point contest than Russell Westbrook."
"This site is amazing lol  &amp;#x200B;  Lebron James just took a dump in midcourt  That was some load LAL !!

"&gt; I’m kind of surprised he didn’t get in for his first year in Houston considering how well the team was that season.  He was an 18 point, 8 assist player in a stacked Western conference.  He would have had to beat out one of the following:  * Steph Curry  - Arguably the best player in the league * James Harden  -  Arguably the best player in the league * Klay Thompson  - His team was doing even better than Houston, and 20 PPG on 44% 3 point shooting with great defense * Russell Westbrook  - Averaging a Triple Double * Damien Lillard  - 27 PPG, 6.6 PPG, carrying a team   * Jimmy Butler - 22/5/5 - leading a team from 31 wins to 47 wins"
"Clay Bennett could not find any public funding for a new arena, so he and his group decided to move the team to OKC to his hometown. If you are owner or majority owner you can do whatever you want. OKC is able fill the arena each year, and it does help with young Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka.   It will be interesting to see going forward if those fans will still come to fill the arena when Sam Presti attempt to gut the roster. There won't be any new team for NBA, but maybe one of these team who are not happy in their market, and find Seattle market viable to go through the moving process."
"Everyone in this thread is trying to blame injuries but the fact of the matter is, there were other players more deservng and he took a step back in the regular season from the level he was at in 2016.  Plus look at the guys selected ahead of him most of those years:  Steph Curry  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Klay Thompson  Its hard to say any of those guys didnt deserve it."
"Yeah this is just a clickbait article based on a tweet that like you said was just expressing an opinion. Also the guy who tweeted this had the opinion that the heat should have offered Bam Adebayo, herro, Justise winslow, dragic, and picks for Russell Westbrook last offseason lol.   And one of the most well connected heat reporters said that the heat will definitely not include herro in a trade for him.    http://twitter.com/GregSylvander/status/1324014605551763460"
Yeah any metric can be torn apart because alot of them don't take a player's role into account. They're great for comparing similar players but if you're trying to use them to decide who is better between a super efficient role player and Russell Westbrook you're going to come to a startlingly inaccurate conclusion.
"&gt; Owner Tilman Fertitta reportedly had strong interest in Jeff Van Gundy, whom Harden and Russell Westbrook opposed.   Damn.  JVG was *never* getting that gig lmao"
Russell Westbrook
"went to UCLA for undergrad  **jeremy lin**: his warriors days. played 5's at collins court. super athletic, didn't shoot a single jump shot. killed everyone and was nice enough to sign autographs as a consolation   **luis scola**: was pissing at the urinals outside SAC courts, and he used the one next to mine. said ""whats up scola"" he just nodded politely and said he couldn't get a photo cause he had to get back to practice. I didn't ask for one  **jordan adams**: ucla men's team during that time. threw a lob for him at collins court. got a fastbreak steal and slowed down for him to catch up,  floated it up the left side of the rim and he threw it down  **baron davis**: think he was retired at that point. ayed 5s at collins court. he didn't play any defense. basically went from one 3pointline to the other, waiting for outlet passes and chucking 3s  **zach lavine**: 6th man on ucla men's team. pauley courts doors were opened for students to play, but it mighta been midterms or finals, cause no one was there except for me, two of my friends, and zach lavine, who was putting up midrangers and getting his own rebound, probably after practice. got his rebounds for him for a while, but he didn't say thank you  **scottie pippen**: lax. took a friend to the airport, passed by southwest (i think) and saw the dude with shades on. I yelled out ""yo scottie pippen, big fan"" he turned around saw my bulls practice tank and white cement 4s and took a photo with me. big ass hands  **malcolm lee**: timberwolves I think. played 5s with us after his workout. destroyed us. going like 30% speed but got anywhere he wanted dribbling super fucking low. i vaguely remember he only took floaters or something  **thomas welsh**: I think he was visiting the campus at that time. a european big was taking him around, and we shot around together at collins court in the morning. he asked me what I liked about ucla, and we chatted for a while. asked him what his name was, and he said welsh... thought he meant he was from wales and thought oh well guess he didn't want me knowing  **russell westbrook**: okc days i think. saw him working out during the summer at the SAC with a trainer. I think it might have been after the patrick beverly injury. he was doing really simple drills, half speed layups, give n go backdoor layups. I remember thinking that he's not gonna be effective without his explosiveness, but if anyone was gonna work his way back into health, it would be russell.  **adria gasol** (doesn't really count): not an nba player, ucla mens team walk on, pau/marc gasols younger brother. had an elective with him. nice quiet dude in class. knew for sure he wasn't getting minutes in college. nice guy though"
Did he just start Patrick fucking Beverly over Russell Westbrook
"Tier 1 (all time passers) : Bron, Jokic, Luka, CP3  Tier 2 (great passers) : Harden, Wall, Rondo, Rubio, Trae, Lonzo  Tier 3 (really good): Simmons, Westbrook, Russell, Lowry, Steph, Ja, Fox  Tier 4 (good) : Draymond, Dame, Derozan, Graham, Middleton, Beal, Conley  Tier 4 (average for primary creators) : Booker, Brogdon, Kyrie, Dragic, Kemba, Jrue,Mitchell  Tier bigs (not as versatile as Jokic) : Marc Gasol, Bam, Sabonis"
Yes Ball for Portis. Where do I sign up   &gt;Russell Westbrook 2022 Free Agency or Trade for Draft Picks  Nah I'm not giving up picks for Russ. I'd rather just draft a PG
"The Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook elbow jumpers, didnt think it would be that blatant with RW either"
Russell Westbrook against the Rockets in Game 2 in 2017. 51 point triple double but it ended in a close loss
Here comes the 99OVR Bol Bol and PF/C Russell Westbrook.
“The league is also hopeful to expand guidelines on Russell Westbrook whoopin’ that ass when intoxicated fans get mouthy”
https://www.si.com/.amp/nba/2019/09/17/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-lebron-james-dan-gilbert-best-feuds-decade  https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/11/23/16693586/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-fight-thunder-warriors  https://sports.cbslocal.com/2017/02/17/keidel-the-simmering-durant-westbrook-feud/amp/  https://thunderousintentions.com/2019/09/22/okc-thunder-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant/amp/  There’s a bunch of articles documenting their feud. They play nice for the cameras because they’re professionals not trying to cause trouble for their teams. I think someone’s just a little salty that OKC couldn’t get past LeBron in 2013 or that they blew a 3-1 lead in 2016. Too bad you don’t have a banner to cry into because your only championship was won 41 years ago for a city that’s 1500 miles away and doesn’t even hang in your arena.
Ah so your point is that because Giannis won MVP and DPOY he must be better than Davis. By that logic he’s better than LeBron too right?   Derrick Rose won MVP and wasn’t a top five player. So did Russell Westbrook.
I will say the same about journalists doing the same. Not long ago we were saying Russell Westbrook being equal to Luke Kennard.
Russell Westbrook is vastly overrated
"KAT is not a top 15 player. He isn't top 20. LeBron James, Luca Doncic, Giannis, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Jason Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Brad Beal, kawhi Leonard, Paul George, the joker, Jamal Murray, CP3, Dame Dash. That's twenty and I have another dozen who might be better."
1. Trae Young  2. Doncic  3. Ricky Rubio  4. CP3  5. Lamelo Ball  6. Ben Simmons  7. Westbrook  8. D'Angelo Russell  9.  Ja Morant  10. Edit.  Lowry
"Averaging it out based on rank, this is the positioning of everyone who qualified for both sides, ordered tie-breakers by higher peak.   1.0 - LeBron James (1/1)  4.0 - Steph Curry (2/6)  5.5 - Chris Paul (7/4)  6.0 - Kawhi Leonard (10/2)  6.5 - Giannis Antetokounmpo (3/10)  6.5 - Russell Westbrook (5/8)  6.5 - Kevin Durant (8/5)  6.5 - James Harden (6/7)  7.0 - Nikola Jokic (11/3)  9.0 - Anthony Davis (9/9)  15.5 - Derrick Rose (20/11)  15.5 - Jimmy Butler (15/16)  18.0 - Kyrie Irving (16/20)  18.5 - Draymond Green (25/12)  19.0 - Paul George (17/21)  23.5 - Kyle Lowry (23/24)"
"I was curious so I searched single season and playoff BPMs, here's what they consider the ""top 25"" in each, I think averaging it would produce a pretty decent list.

What did Russell Westbrook ever do to you
"I’m glad you asked   In no particular order: Magic Johnson, Steph Curry, Allen Iverson, Gary Payton, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, John Stockton, Oscar Robertson, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook"
"Upon entering the bubble Presti had meetings with a couple of GMs. Knicks and Lakers weren't included.   ""After a warm reunion and greeting in the Grand Floridian lobby for Russell Westbrook, a text message to former Thunder forward Jeff Green and meetings with Brooklyn Nets General Manager Sean Marks and Philadelphia 76ers General Manager Elton Brand""   I would imagine teams have had deals in the works for awhile now."
Houston for Russell Westbrook
top 10 overall:    Magic Johnson	301  LeBron James	274  Chris Paul	239  Russell Westbrook	235  Isiah Thomas	219  John Stockton	208   Kevin Johnson	200  Steve Nash	187  James Harden	179  Tim Hardaway	176
"Yeah right, games in which he's in foul trouble because he presses full court against Rubio and in which he's passive offensively : the perfect representation of Russell Westbrook when it counts, passivity and trying to play hard on defense LOL"
Russell Westbrook has been and will always be better than Dame. And he’s cooler than Curry
KD would've won more championships than LeBron if only he didn't waste his years playing alongside Russell Westbrook.
Assists and selflessness don't go hand in hand. Steph Curry is one of the most unselfish players of all time and he averages less than 7 assists per game. Russell Westbrook is a certified ball hog and he lead the league in assists twice
"In 2 years, the Rockets are having a fire sale and decide that the best package is trading Harden to OKC for SGA + multitude of picks. OKC has 2 more max slots that year and sign KD who has opted out to a max contract and add Russell Westbrook who has decided to give them a hometown discount so the Thunder are able to use their mid level on Serge Ibaka.   Kendrick Perkins decides he wants to come back and declares himself a FA with the intention of signing for the vet minimum with OKC. OKC learns from their mistake and refuses to sign Perk and the big 4 put together one magical run in their mid 30s and win the championship. KD wins finals MVP but declares Russ is the best player in franchise history. Harden retires and opens up a strip club chain in OKC."
Imagining a toddler with the energy level and commitment-to-action as Russell Westbrook is a scary thing. Or maybe that's just all toddlers.
"Giannis is literally tall Russell Westbrook come to think about it, they even look alike a bit."
Westbrook/Harden/Durant/Ibaka  God it's still so mind boggling... Presti built what could've been the greatest dynasty of all-time not including the Russell Celtics in 3 consecutive drafts never having the #1 pick
"Simmons needs to shoot the ball and become a legit threat to score before he’s put anywhere near top 20.  Klay is definitely top 20  Middleton has shown he’s a clear third option on a championship team. Middleton can step up his game on occasions when needed but he ain’t top 20.  As for Russell, if you’re referring to Westbrook I disagree with him being top 20.  If you’re referring to D’angelo I feel like he actually has the potential to be top 20 at his peak but he needs to hone his strengths and he needs a team that’s gonna be patient with his development."
"He was jumping out of the building like Steve Francis or Russell Westbrook, but his game is def not the same. He had to adjust after all the injuries. Cause before the injuries he was one of the quickest guards in the NBA. He could stop and start on a dime, change direction in the blink of an eye and was still very fast with the ball in transition."
"""Low Turnovers and no assists"" ah yes that does indeed sound like Russell Westbrook to me"
"At that time he was the equivalent of James Harden or Russell Westbrook. Big, selfish stats. Only difference is he learned and improved but Westbrook and Harden didn't."
another example of why Russell Westbrook will never win anything
Russell Westbrook
"See I don’t disagree about the Mavs, I was just pointing out how I think thats poor logic.   And I’m sure we could put a lot of guards in that position. In retrospect I think Derrick Rose is overrated for what people expected out of him because “he was only 22”. But I do think Derrick Rose’s value would be in how he would get smarter as a player rather than production. Cause I’m honestly thinking a controlled Russell Westbrook with high IQ would be unstoppable."
"Russell Westbrook had a 36.5"" max vertical. Which has led to countless posts pointing out how ""Player X has the same max vertical as Westbrook!"" as if that made them comparable athletically"

"Westbrook. There was a lot of negative commentary around the time he was selected. I remember hearing stuff like ""If there's one player I can confidently say won't last in the NBA for long it's Russell Westbrook""  Russ moved up to the draft boards a lot in the 2 months leading up to the draft. He went from a projected late FRP to late lottery to getting picked top-4"
"&gt;	Westbrook was a huge reason they were even up 3-1...the whole team choked  First you should learn to read, second I said he’s a huge reason they were up;   Games 1-4: Westbrook averaged 28/12/7 and was a solid 37% from 3 on 5.5 attempts. He lead the team and anyone who watched the games knew he was the reason they were winning with his playmaking and ability to drive in and get shots. Durant in game 1 shot 10-30 and game 4 shot 8-24.   Games 5-7 I pointed out the whole team choked, Durant shot 12-31, 10-31 in games 5 and 6 which is probably the worst cold streak for a shooter of his caliber.   You saying Westbrook shot his teams out of the playoffs implies everyone but Russell played great and him taking his shots ruined the team. When in reality, Russell Westbrook was just part of a massive team choke.   And 2013-2015 Playoffs was injuries that took away the potential, 2013 OKC were considered the best team until Westbrook’s knees got taken out by Pat Bev"
i understand sub zero is cold but why is he on a thumbnail for russell westbrook
"I mean, I enjoy keeping up with what Morey is trying next as a GM more than I enjoy watching Harden or Russell Westbrook play. The difference is the time invested: I'll sit and watch clips or entire games of the Houston Rockets. Learning about some bold sign and trade is literally just reading a tweet and thinking ""Hmmm. Interesting."""
"&gt;But by definition, ""racism"" itself is more systemic racism.  [ insert that Russell Westbrook video]  No, systemic racism is systemic racism, that's why it's called systemic racism."
"&gt; The Mavericks have a deep roster of quality role players (before injuries added up anyway), but only one other clear starting caliber player who himself was returning from missing most of 2 seasons and continued to have injury problems. And of course they have a coach who is one of the best at running an offense with role players.  It is true that the Mavs have one of the best benches in the league that have one of the best net ratings. However, the Bucks and Lakers have an even better bench statistically and this doesn't stop Giannis and Lebron from having elite level on/off, just like they pretty much always have.   &gt;He completely dominates the ball for his minutes, and in those minutes they were the #1 rated offense in the NBA.  And when he wasn't on the field but instead JJ Barea etc was their PG they were still a top 10 offense in the league in a historically great offensive season. Their offense without Luka and with their backup PG's would have been the number 1 offense any year from 2010-2015 (sandwiched between the 7SOL suns and elite GSW teams""). They were still a top 10 offense without Luka and their backup PG's aren't exactly worldbeaters... Not to mention their defense almost goes up as much as their offense goes down with Luka off the floor.  &gt;Now if you are discussing MVP, distributing credit among the Mavs, etc. sure it's relevant to overall team success. But quoting Hassan Whiteside at him is a joke.  I use Whiteside and Russell Westbrook as an example because a big counterpoint people bring up are his high volume stats and advanced stats that favour Luka and make him look amazing. Most ""advanced"" stats are just box score stats with different formulas and weigh people like Luka, Whiteside, Westbrook etc a lot while not weighing in people like Klay Thompson, or Dennis Rodman etc. Here is a quick point. Luka's USG% jumped a huge amount form a rookie to a sophomore. However even as a ROOKIE he had a higher USG% than any year of Steve Nash, Magic Johnson, Chris Paul, Stockton etc. He gets the ball in his hands a ton of the time and he gobbles up a ton of high uncontested rebounds so he gets significantly overrated. You are right that they have a great coach and a quality deep roster. That is exactly my point. They should be getting much more of the credit for the Mavs success and not Luka. Luka gets credit by many for carrying his team when he has a top 5 bench in the league statistically. A bench that good has never missed the playoffs as far as I know. Of course though, I have a Suns flair so everything I bring up gets chalked up to being salty the Suns didn't draft him. I think my points are very solid.  EDIT: I forgot to aknowledge this point: &gt;The fact that the bench (in lesser minutes against lesser competition) also performed very well offensively is of little relevance to Luka's performance.  Bench players play vs starters and with starters a ton. It isn't the case of ""well now it is Mavs starters vs opponent starters"" and then a couple minutes later ""well now it Mavs Bench vs other teams bench"". No, there is huge amount of overlap and you can look at how good team is with and without a player on the floor and most teams have huge sample sizes of different 2,3,4,and 5 man lineups throughout the year."
"Brown is younger, on a long deal and plays a position of more value. Why would the Celtics trade Jaylen brown for Rudy Gobert on a on year deal when they didn’t trade brown for Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, or Anthony Davis?   Value is a thing in the NBA."
"On the other hand.  [BBBREAKDOWN Why LaMelo Ball Is The Number One Pick in the 2020 NBA Draft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqKLDM1L1Oo). It's like he got paid for the video. Almost all highlights with only critic, his shooting mechanic.  People and journalist don't seem too smart when they are talking about rookies. Nobody knows how good he is before he has to go against (EVERY NIGHT) Bledsoe, Hill, Lowry, Kemba, Brogdon, Dragic, Simmons, Irving, Wall, Young, Beverly, Murray, Westbrook, CP3, Conley, Luka, Dame, Morant, his Brother, Russell, Curry."
"Luka has a lot of ""high volume stats guy who doesn't increase the teams net efficiency."" This had been the case both years he has been in the league as well as tiny sample size of playoffs so far. He puts up Russell Westbrook or Hasan Whiteside style volume stats."
"if you're going to nitpick every poor play of a star player in the league you can basically be here forever. losing a series against Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook when the rest of your roster is very old, ok, not that big a deal. blowing a 3-1 lead with one of the better roster's in the nba? Big deal"
"Anyone saying Chris Paul is more athletic than Russell Westbrook or Zion Williamson, just doesn't watch basketball."
"It took them 7 games to beat OKC.   It took MVPs James Harden and Russell Westbrook 7 games to beat an inexperience group sans Chris Paul, Adams and like two other guys"
Russell Westbrook.  I feel like he needs to bait people into making comments so he can destroy them.
Russell Westbrook also has better counting stats than Curry. Do you think he's better as well?  Oscar was 9x first team all NBA in an era with mediocre guards. Only competiton was Jerry West and Walt Frazier and 2/3 of them got first team each year.  Actually all NBA teams are almost irrelevant from the 60s-70s because to be one of the top 2 guards you only had to compete with about 16 players (2 players x  8 teams)  Steph is competing with 60 players for first team all NBA. So it's not the same level of achievement
&gt;who defends hard   Not according to Russell Westbrook
I'm loyal to the team first but root my favorite players if they leave. I'm a big Russell Westbrook fan and cheer for him to do well individually even against the Thunder.
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook fan here. I know I know
Eh Russell Westbrook was kind of a steal in his draft class
See Russell Westbrook
This is not good for Russell Westbrook
Yeah because he didn't get 4 to 8 future first round draft picks for Russell Westbrook when this is all said and done.
"Dead Rubber Russell Westbrook, hate watching this guy play."
"??? Nobody said it would, but all of them combined do have a real chance at having more production than Russell Westbrook, which is who they gave up to get all this."
"Rudderless flow? Why would the Thunder have a rudderless flow? Tanking doesn’t mean there’s no plan in place. Presti is well known for being extremely open and communicative with his players. He made sure long ago that Shai, CP3, and everyone else knew exactly what their plans are. CP3 basically confirmed that with his pseudo farewell video two months ago.  Shai knows what the plan is. Presti has earned the trust of the players, and he’s explained to them that this is the best shot at building a true contender. The Thunder have a strong team culture, one of the best front offices in the league, and a ton of draft and trade assets, they’re not suddenly going to turn into the Kings. I see very little reason to fear that they’ll be irrelevant for more than a few years.  Did being bad early in a career damage Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Did it damage Devin Booker? Being on a bad team doesn’t suddenly turn players into losers, especially if the front office shows it has a plan."
They’re a Russell Westbrook away from the 7th seed
Right? Russell Westbrook will get you at least the 9 seed.
"See that’s the problem. You keep contradicting yourself. Last year, like I said, was by far his best. He was worthy of an all-star spot for the first time in his career. The year before he didn’t.   The only reason he made it was being the 2nd scoring option on the team with the best record and playing in the East. Let me put it this way: he was an all-star for the exact same reason Jrue wasn’t (bad team in the West). But you label them both as all-stars, doesn’t make much sense.  Then you want me to treat Khris as the player he was last year in the regular season. Let me do the same for Brook and Jrue.   Last year Jrue finished 21st in all-star voting for a western backcourt spot, behind the likes of Beverley and Ball (yeah, fan voting can be stupid). Got 0 media votes. Not a single media member voted for him. Coaches didn’t select him either. I doubt he even made a snubs list. So by your definition that’s not an all-star, not even a borderline one.  Moving on to Brook. Last year he shot 31.4% from 3 on 4.8 attempts per game. That’s Russell Westbrook territory. So judging him the way you want me to judge Khris, he’s a defensive specialist with some postup moves and a chucker.  And that’s why I don’t judge a player based on their last regular season alone. I like to be objective and consistent."
Russell Westbrook
Wtf JWall are you serious.  I waited 2 years for you to come back and now you’re just gonna leave now that you’re healthy.    Just fuck off outta my sight at this point..He’s lucky Russell Westbrook exists or there’s no way we would ever be able to move his insane contract
"The Spurs moved on from him because they thought they were getting Marcus Morris. They had a collection of spot up guys, meh playmaking, and didn’t have anyone they trusted in iso situations. Morris fucked em and they ended up signing DeMarre Carrol? Idk someone like that but for his skills he didn’t really contribute much to their personnel but fits like a glove around a guard that struggles to space the floor on his own like Russell Westbrook or John Wall"
Russell Westbrook
"I never laughed so hard when a news story would be: ""Kiwi basketball star Steven Adams has led his Oklahoma City Thunder to victory today. Adams led the way with 12 points and 8 rebounds. All-star teammate Russell Westbrook also had a good game, with 46 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists."""
"10 years ago this team has Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka on it."
"Amazing is a bit of a stretch for Amare’s shot. I mean, I’m assuming when someone says shooting they are referring to long range shooting, like long 2s and 3s, not shooting in or around the paint.   Dinwiddie’s averages are pretty bad from distance. Maybe that’s also shot selection, but that matters. “Can’t shoot,” again, requires some amount of leeway. Almost everyone shoots today. Almost everyone can and make some shots. So someone who can’t shoot today is someone who is inconsistent, takes bad shots, has low percentages, and has a hard time hitting 3s. I just described Russell Westbrook.   Anyway, I still think Dinnwiddie is a fine candidate for this exercise for modern players. It’s all relative."
not sure why this is downvoted lol. but yeah basically a low post/bruiser/driver + faciliatator fill these roles. Russell westbrook
To the surprise of absolutely no one. We've literally liquidated our entire roster for draft compensation. We have one player left who has played with Russell Westbrook lmao.
&gt; I should probably link their Beef History episode.  I got you: [Secret Base episode Russell Westbrook vs. Patrick Beverly Beef History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4htEvURGco)
&gt; Russell Westbrook had some beef with Patbev for a while  That's underselling it. PatBev dove at Westbrook's knees and blew them up. Pretty sure WB would kill PatBev if he could legally get away with it.
post your favorite Russell Westbrook off-ball highlights from the last 3 years...I'll wait
"Russell Westbrook had some beef with Patbev for a while, and once got asked how good he was matched up with him.  He responded by saying “Patbev trick y’all man like he plays defence. He ain’t guarding nobody, just running around... doing nothing.”"
Who wouldn't be mad about being mentioned in Russell westbrook deals right now honestly.
LMAO are John Wall and Russell Westbrook actually going to be traded for one another?? man. Also if this actually goes through it shows how Westbrook's contract is viewed AND how Houston is just flat out ready to blow it up
Russell Westbrook plz for lolz.
Hey that’s not Russell Westbrook
Probably trading for Russell Westbrook.
"Okay, then realize you are the minority in that regard lol. Russell Westbrook would be a hall of famer if he retired today (don't believe me, check, there's ppl in the hall who have done less). Gordon Hayward would not in any argument.  How old are you? If Westbrook is the least team minded player you've ever witnessed you must've missed Allen Iverson, prime Kobe, early MJ, cause none of those guys were team oriented at all."
I'm sorry but there's no world where russell westbrook is taking a back seat to lamelo ball bro
okay give me Kobe Bryant over Russell Westbrook idk what pointless and random comparisons do for you here
Stfu for real. Warrior and Curry haters are in full effect since Klay's injury. Holyyyyy shiiiiit...  Chris Paul ain't shit compared to Curry except in the dirty player stat. Russell Westbrook cares more about his triple doubles than winning. The only close comparison you made was Harden. Honestly you should have your posting privileges revoked for this shitty take.
"Hmm two MVP candidates together? Like pairing Harden with Chris Paul?... oh wait, no it would be more like pairing Harden with Russell Westbrook? oh wait..."
"I still remember him in the playoffs against the Clippers, getting a fast break with just seconds left in a close game. It was a 3 on 1 fast break vs Matt Barnes. Kevin Durant on his right, Russell Westbrook on his left. This jackass decides to take it himself, and Matt knew he wouldn’t fucking pass it, and was able to intentionally foul. Pretty sure OKC ended up winning, but my God if there was ever one play to define a player, that’s the one for him."
"By seeing that the Magic are interested in Westbrook, I thought about this trade idea:  **SAS get** Aaron Gordon  **ORL get** Russell Westbrook  **HOU get** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, 2021 1st via ORL heavily protected (like Top 20), and whoever The Orlando wanna add: just Fournier or like Aminu and Birch.   SAS would free up 20M, that's huge man, and still get a guy like Gordon that fits perfectly here and he really needs a change of scenary. LMA and Rudy might be too much but the fact that the Spurs still haven't made a move makes me think that it's not easy to find a deal, so I think it would be just fine.  The Orlando get his guy and lemme say, getting Westbrook for Gordon and filler and a heavily protected pick is, imo, a nice deal.  Houston trades away that massive contract and that unhappy player and get LMA, Rudy and let's say Fournier, they could still contend man.  I think this would be nice deal. What's your thoughts about it?"
"Even I, as a long time hater of Russell Westbrook, see the impact the bubble has had on the view on these players."
"CP3 was an all star caliber player but when your playing in the conference with Steph curry, russell westbrook, damian lillard and the offense is built around james hardens 40% usage rate your never making an all star game. There's such a big track record of him imploding in big moments I don't understand how people can overlook it at this point."
you're severely overrating russell westbrook if you think he makes them a threat to come out of the east holy shit  who do you think he is??
"if only triple doubles mean a player is good  russell westbrook is a not a positive asset to any team  tanking team? he's a good floor raiser and will win you more games than you want  high-level lottery team? gives u an awful contract and takes away development for your young players  playoff team? lol no championship team is gonna have russell westbrook as a starter, why would u want him"
"MSG Attendance with Julius Randle as the headliner: 100%  MSG Attendance with Russell Westbrook as the headliner: 100%  The Knicks need help winning, not drawing fans."
"Hey, at least we improved from the Russell Westbrook ideas lol"
Would Russell Westbrook cut me a personal check to play for the Knicks?
"If point guard was a priority, they would've taken Haliburton.  So I don't think it's an indictment on Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook sucks now? What the fuck is going on on this site?
Sources close to the Knicks front office have also expressed that trading for Russell Westbrook is no longer a priority to them either.  Well neither of these fit the r/NBA narrative about the Knicks and their FO. Wonder what they're going to come up with next?
Well here is how.  He is going to stand there.  And only when harden is done dribbling will he get the ball.  Perhaps you.  Having never met tatum can tell me how he is going to enjoy that.  Bevause chris paul didnt.  Russell westbrook didnt.   Please tell ME more.
I don’t think Russell Westbrook is allowed to talk about organizations not holding players accountable.   Especially when said player is much better than him at doing the exact same things he wants to do.
Yeah doesn’t sell it for me. Save the picks for someone else.  Spread the touches around more. We have a new fo and coaching staff that seems to take development much more seriously. You get Russell Westbrook and you’re a Russell Westbrook team. At 32 with a 130m I’m not into that. Would be exciting at times but it’s not worth it long term
I’d trade him for Russell Westbrook 😉 hope you’re doin good brotha

He's not new and improved. It's a similar strategy to what Hinkie would have done given the same assets, outside of Hinkie likely trading Gallinari.  The biggest point of the process was maximizing your chance to get multiple stars, which is incredibly difficult to do in any affordable way. Presti started with two."

B-b-but... Russell Westbrook = bad
Fertita isn't the best owner but let's not pretend harden hasn't been given every opportunity. They traded for paul and he shrunk in the moment. They surrounded him with a team to elevate his individual stats. You really think Mike D'antoni wanted to play the way they did. They traded for westbrook at the request of harden and to make the deal happen they had to give up their 2024 and 2026 picks and a pick swaps in 2025 all to give harden what he wanted. Btw those picks look real good if they get rid of harden. Then they got rid of capella just to be able to play russell in the system. Normally I agree with the player but harden has been given every opportunity but he is the one that has come up small in big moments.
Hayward and Russell Westbrook would be good for an entertaining first round exit
Russell Westbrook
"Except it is about Belichick, because again, that’s the person is the one that made the decision to offer him the money. I don’t understand how you’re not getting that. Do you really think GMs in the NFL passed on Cam because of the media?  And even the players you brought up, again my point is that the media still had no major affect on their careers beyond painting some picture of them.   Tim Tebow was traded after his big run in Denver that the media sensationalized and spent one more year in the league after that. Russell Westbrook is an even worse example: he hates the media, but he has still won an MVP and is currently on a max contract. The media had no altering affect on their careers, their play on the court or field is what dictated it.   You’re way overblowing how much GMs and decision makers for teams care at all about the media."
"Al Horford, Chris Paul, and Russell Westbrook haven’t missed two consecutive seasons due to serious leg injuries.   By the time Klay is back it would be over 800 days since he last played an NBA game. He will also have 3 years left on this deal. All three players you mention are also serviceable too."
"&gt; he can still be valuable in today's NBA.  So in the NBA, there's how many minutes you give players to produce on the floor, and also how much of the salary cap they consume. Julius Randle consumes WAY too much of the salary cap. I could see him being a decent bench guy at 7-8 million per year. But he stops your team from being a contender when you are paying him 18 million per year simply because he doesn't produce enough on the court to be worth that, and he basically stops you from employing an actually good player in that salary slot instead.  &gt; I think it's too simplistic of a view to assume that if you can't at least shoot or play defense you can't play in the NBA.  That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying he's not worth his salary. Take Russell Westbrook. He has a toxic contract and a flawed game, but he's still a net positive player that you want to have on your team. The problem is his contract is the equivalent of employing THREE other above average starters, so having him on your team means you have a talent deficit structurally built in."
"Russell Westbrook missed the playoffs with OKC in 2015 when KD got surgery and missed most of the season. No one remembers this, and no one will remember this season for Curry."
"That's just straight up wrong.    |Rank|Player|Age|Tm|First|Pts Won|Pts Max|Share| |-:|:-|-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Russell Westbrook|28|OKC|69.0|888.0|1010|0.879| |2|James Harden|27|HOU|22.0|753.0|1010|0.746| |3|Kawhi Leonard|25|SAS|9.0|500.0|1010|0.495| |4|LeBron James|32|CLE|1.0|333.0|1010|0.330| |5|Isaiah Thomas|27|BOS|0.0|81.0|1010|0.080|  [IT got no 1st or 2nd place votes](https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/06/2016-17-Kia-NBA-Most-Valuable-Player-of-the-Year-Award.pdf), he was closer to 0 pts than he was to half of 4th place's pts. Hell, he wasn't even on half the ballots.  Kawhi woulda won that season even if your weird hypothetical of the top 2 not existing happened."
"Right so stories like this don't in any way shape or form originate from a source near him?  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2654113-russell-westbrook-reportedly-angry-hurt-by-kevin-durant-leaving-thunder  Tell me genius, do you think sports reporters just make shit up for shits and giggles?"
"Russell Westbrook, come on down, you are the next contestant on the New York Knicks."
"I want to make it clear that I actually like Lavine. I hope he figures it out and puts it all together. He’s not a stiff. I just think he’s properly rated right now, not underrated. He’s a fringe borderline all star who is putting up good stats on a bad team. He’s never been in a good situation and that matters a lot. I hope he eventually does so we will know if he’s actually willing to sacrifice for a good team, or if he’ll just end up being a worse version of Russell Westbrook. I think he’s capable of being a decent defender and passer, and he is a better shooter than he first seems (though his shot selection is a bit meh, but I’ll accept that). I just think when we are evaluating players today, I don’t think he should be rated much higher than he currently is. Maybe slightly more all star consideration, but I think there’s a good argument that Jaylen Brown should have gotten the nod over him, as his two way play on one of the better teams in basketball is more impressive to me personally."
 **by goooooooood that's russell westbrook music**
And Randle is about to be traded for Russell Westbrook.
It’s Russell Westbrook time
"Every player in the league relies on athleticism.  Klay doesn’t as much as Russell Westbrook, but if his athleticism declines even further he is going to struggle mightily"
Looks like a perfect salary match for Russell Westbrook once the Rockets trade Harden
"i agree with most of that, but i feel like people tend to treat cp3 as some blameless victim.  this is a guy who hasn't gotten along with plenty of people before harden.  imagine being harden and having to listen to this dude complain about how things are being run.  constantly.  in the last warriors series, harden averaged 35 ppg and i believe cp3 averaged 16 ppg.  think of any nba team where the guy averaging 16 thinks he can go up to the guy averaging 35 and tell him how things are going to be.  now realize that the guy averaging 35 just had to have a historic scoring season just to drag his team to a decent seed because the other guy was injured for a big chunk of the year and out of shape (on a contender!!) for the rest of it.  watching that guy not be able to beat anybody off the dribble but then tell you that you don't know what wins.  imagine the gall of cp3.  you've never gotten out of the 2nd round until joining harden and you complain that harden's way is wrong? you team up to form one of the better teams in nba history, then come back not in shape while he's carrying your ass against the warriors, a winnable series if you are in peak form, and you're the complainer?  imagine having to listen to that if you are harden.  and then realizing cp3 has lost a step and has an albatross contract.  i don't blame him for thinking the writing was on the wall.  not his fault cp3 cared more about getting in shape for his revenge tour so he could lose in the 1st round instead of being in shape for his last best shot at a title.  now do i blame harden for thinking russell westbrook was the solution to the problem and starting this cascade of events that has brought us here.  sure.  anybody knew westbrook was a bad idea.  is it as bad as being cheap like fertitta, forcing the westbrook trade like fertitta when morey could've talked harden down, chasing away d'antoni like fertitta and then chasing away morey like fertitta.  no.  so i do give harden some blame.  but if cp3 stays in shape, maybe this never happens either."
Russell Westbrook
Unless we trade half of them for Russell Westbrook for no reason
&gt;morey doesn’t make bad trades  Russell Westbrook would like to have a word with you
Just to be sure it’s you; *How do you feel about Russell Westbrook?*
Imannuel's girl is Russell Westbrook in disguise; he about to reveal he's been traded with a tear-away dress and wig.
"He is wrong. The Rockets, not just Harden, didn't look to be able to win with CP3, even without the Warriors it looked like the Clippers and Lakers got a lot better. The Rockets would have been in a much better situation if Tilman would go over the luxury tax. They lost a lot of picks just to stay under the tax, not to get stars.   My first view on the CP3-Westbrook trade was ""fuck."" I don't like Westbrook and I think he was overrated even in his MVP year. However, there is a good argument for the trade even with the picks, and in a vacuum ignoring Tilman's issues.  How well Harden got along with CP3 is in dispute still. CP3 and Harden really didn't show animosity in the playoffs and they definitely didn't show it in regular season games. Probably the most remembered clips of them were the flops, not them trying to hurt each other or actually get angry.  CP3 had injury issues for both years with the Rockets. He may have been injured this past year if there wasn't a break. If he went further in the playoffs he may have gotten injured there. It's a real unknown but we knew Harden was disappointed about the playoff injury and then having to carry the Rockets for many games the season after.  People forget that Harden was dragging the Rockets in 18-19 during that stretch where he was averaging 40+ while Capela and CP3 were hurt. The only game Harden lost by more than 10 was against the 76ers, sandwiched between 57, 58, 48 and 61 point games including two OT games.  Harden + PJ beat the healthy championship Raptors team where Kawhi played about 40 minutes. That combo beat a good Jazz team. They also beat the Warriors with CP3 out.  Steph Curry went to bat for Harden during this time (search all star game interview) and basically stated he didn't want to play hero ball, he didn't want insane usage with record amounts of unassisted points in a row, he wanted help. https://twitter.com/natefrancis00/status/1096834337566310400? - the convo with Coach Bud is interesting because maybe he didn't need it but maybe Giannis just really talks shit about Harden constantly.  Westbrook had a good reputation with teammates, ignoring the mixed stuff from KD. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2802812-russell-westbrooks-ex-teammate-it-wasnt-always-fun-to-play-with-thunder-pg - even people who have negative things to say about him ""He's going to bring it. When I look at Zero, I have no worries that night about what I'm gonna get out of him. I know he's gonna bring it, he's going to give everything he has. I like that. That motivates me, that pushes me, that keeps me going.""  End result is Harden just probably didn't see CP3 as reliable and wanted to try out Westbrook. Based on the contracts, there may not have been a better choice who did not have similar injury questions. You can argue the Rockets should have gone for multiple good role players instead of Westbrook, but you run into the issue of whether the Rockets could win a championship with just one star. I think they could have, but I also haven't seen any good trade ideas to back that up.  Capela had injury issues too at the time. Last season he had thumb surgery plus the heel issue. Plus the injuries the previous season. Robert Covington can be hot and cold in the playoffs but I don't think he was a bad pickup and a lot of teams were interested in his type. Not getting a center was more for Westbrook and not Harden too."
Does this mean Russell Westbrook confirmed fml
Sounds like Russell Westbrook
this is what russell westbrook does to a championship contender lmfao
You're missing a whole Russell Westbrook in your interpretation of that trade as a CP3 salary dump.
Russell Westbrook
"You know, I think that might actually get people madder than the Durant signing, due to the whole ""they can't keep getting away with it"" factor. Then, if the Warriors win a title and somehow acquire Russell Westbrook and get him a ring, it'll go from tragedy to comedy and we'll get people lobbying them to trade for Ibaka and Jeff Green."
The next step will shock us all: Presti trades Horford and a bunch of picks to the Rockets for...Russell Westbrook and James Harden!!!!!
"wow the thunder turned russell westbrook, james harden, and kevin durant into so many draft picks! -@HugoKitano"
Two days from now:  “Danny Green has been traded to the Rockets along with Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris as part of a three team trade for...Russell Westbrook.”
"One has a chip, the other doesn't. Don't even give me the LeBron argument either, because Harden has had Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, and now Russell Westbrook and he couldn't even make it to a finals appearance.   &amp;#x200B;  1v1, sure Harden is the better player with the better stats but if we're talking about actual basketball, TEAM BASKETBALL, which this sub ignores completely in favor of the juicy ESPN hot-takes they claim they hate, I'd take Kyrie any day."

So clearly the title “KD responds to Kendrick Perkins’ claim that Russell Westbrook is the best to put on an OKC uniform” is an accurate summary of the exchange.

"Starting at Guard, 6’3″ from UCLA, number 0,     RUSSELL WESTBROOK"
"Starting at Guard, 6’3″ from UCLA, number 0,     RUSSELL WESTBROOK"
Totally agree look at the drop off last year.   Westbrook's FG% on shots more than 3 feet from the rim:   Rk Player Season FG%   1 Russell Westbrook 2019-20 .329   2 Russell Westbrook 2018-19 .305   3 Russell Westbrook 2017-18 .355   4 Russell Westbrook 2016-17 .360   5 Russell Westbrook 2015-16 .371   6 Russell Westbrook 2014-15 .352   7 Russell Westbrook 2013-14 .367   8 Russell Westbrook 2012-13 .355   9 Russell Westbrook 2011-12 .389   10 Russell Westbrook 2010-11 .347   11 Russell Westbrook 2009-10 .343   12 Russell Westbrook 2008-09 .343
"[He's right behind Russell Westbrook in All Star voting, so there's that...](https://i.imgur.com/i6TGqct.jpg)"
"Russell Westbrook is a better overall shooter than Gianis, most of Gianis jumpers are wide wide open because he’s such a threat from the interior"
"He's good in his role.  He doesn't really create shots for others.  His drives are all to the rim--which is fine, he's good at it.    We don't want to go back to a ball dominant point guard.  Let him be a shooting guard that shares the offense with the point guard, or even a third player on the court, like this three guard lineup.   It's a much more dangerous mode of attack than making SGA the point guard of the future and throwing out some vagabond at the SG slot.    There are more viable point guards in the league than traditional shooting guards, and that's not changing any time soon with the impact Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook have had on middle and high school kids coming up that will be playing with SGA in his prime."
I would only ever call Russell Westbrook a slug.
"Totally forgot to include them, but you’re right. Westbrook actually has a negative offensive BPM.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id1_select=Chris+Paul&amp;player_id1=paulch01&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;y2=2020#site_menu_link"
"Ah yes, NBA point guard Russell Westbrook only racks up assists because he handles the ball a lot and passes to his teammates.  How dare he."
Damian Lilliard and Russell Westbrook
Only against Paul George and/or Russell Westbrook-led teams.
"This narrative is 100% bullshit, it picked up steam only because of the delusional OKC fans and r/nba hates the media.

"“This never happened so your strawman argument is moot, but your point still stands!”   You guys are ridiculous, lol. This sub also defended Westbrooks behavior with the media.  The funniest part is Westbrook was always treated very well by the local media. This is the funny backstory http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/"
Russell Westbrook
That ejection was so soft I'm almost positive Russell Westbrook was behind it.
"They had OKC tanking bc the expectation was trades were imminent. That could still happen   Paul, Shai, Adams, Galinari, Schroeder are good players and a solid bench in Noel, Bazley, Ferg  Also since I’m sure you have a source on Russ being inefficient during the clutch.

Russell Westbrook would lead the league in scoring
MVPs are narrative driven and based on context. Derick rose and Russell Westbrook don't hold a candle to CP3 as point guards yet they have MVPs. Accolades don't make a player better they are just accolades.
"[Only 44 times has the 27-7-7 game been achieved](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=game&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=eq&amp;c1val=27&amp;c2stat=trb&amp;c2comp=eq&amp;c2val=7&amp;c3stat=ast&amp;c3comp=eq&amp;c3val=7&amp;order_by=pts) for some reason, the most recent 27-7-7 was done by James Harden  The only players to do it more than once were Grant Hill, Jerry West, Russell Westbrook &amp; JoJo White. They all did it twice."
He'd got the trip to the finals for sure.  You don't get to pretend it didn't happen.  And yea Durant was ahead of Westbrook over the 2012 season but about what you'd expect going from #1 to #2 and WB was the facilitator and ran the offense.  https://m.herosports.com/nba/player-comparison/kevin-durant-vs-russell-westbrook  Check out 2012 vs 2012 season stats.  Yall are tripping. Westbrook has been a consistently more valuable player and drug some trash teams to the playoffs. Chris Paul was a monster for us and if he stayed healthy would have cemented himself but availability course and debating random single years is irrelevant.   Russel Westbrook has been the better and more successful player throughout his career and his accolades and accomplisments show this.
"&gt; Luck, Skill, and Concentrated Power of Will: a Russell Westbrook memoir  And it's a 200 page hardcover picture book of all the stylish clothes Russ wore to games, with a para or two of his thoughts on why he wore them.  Shit, I'd buy it LOL"
"Ben ""Russell Westbrook"" Simmons  I'd go 120 takes in the remaining 44 games, 30 makes"
"Luck, Skill, and Concentrated Power of Will: a Russell Westbrook memoir"
Russell Westbrook and Devin Booker
I'd rather have Jakar Sampson on the minimum than have to root for Russell Westbrook and his getting fans ejected at away games.
One was OKC's first great point guard and the other is Russell Westbrook.
I literally give zero shits about Russell Westbrook   Find a new slant
"Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul    Paul is the better Player, Westbrook the better career"
Bill Russell Westbrook Lopez
Bill Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is better than anyone Giannias has every played with tho?
"If someone said Russell in any sports setting, I'd think of Bill first, then Wilson second.  Westbrook is just Westbrook LOL. Or Brodie."
"Russell Westbrook III, please."
"Even though Oscar did it the most, no one had done more consecutive triple doubles than Wilt Chamberlain (9 straight) back in March of 1968. That record stood for 51 years til Westbrook broke it back in 2019. And if we're being fair, Wilt probably had even longer streaks with blocks which they didn't officially record his entire career. Bill Russell most assuredly had triple doubles with blocks as well. So Oscar wasn't the only one."
"Even that's underplaying it, only Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook outdid those numbers. And he's doing it while being quite a bit more efficient offensively than Westbrook.  To be fair to all the other triple double machines over the years, it is clearly a more triple double friendly environment these days."
He has never beaten Russell Westbrook?
"I believe eFG doesn't include free throws and weighs 3s as better shots. Both things would make Russ look really bad.   True Shooting incorporates FTs which helps out Russ significantly.     Year| League Average TS% | Russell Westbrook TS% | Difference ----- |--------------|----|---- 15-16 | .541 | .554 | +.013 16-17 | .552 | .554 | +.002 17-18 | .556 | .524 | -.032 18-19 | .560 | .501 | -.059 19-20 | .559 | .503 | -.056  Anyway you slice it though, in this version of the league and even if you give him the benefit of his ability to get to the stripe, Russ just isn't an optimal player."
"He means his career, in 5 to 10 years times, there is no indication that Ja cant be as good or better than Fox, Mitchell or Russell etc and Lillard, Curry would be long gone. Westbrook wont fix his shot and he would only be worse every year."
"thank you for doing the math. if i may sum up, it seems that Russell Westbrook is really bad at shooting from beyond 4 feet."
Russell Westbrook to enter dunk contest: confirmed.
"You all won't be laughing in the future, when there are signs aliens are trying to take over Earth, and our last hope relies on Russell Westbrook shooting water balloons into a flying saucer opening 25 feet away."
"Overrated by the eye test: Carmelo Anthony (prime), D'Angelo Russell, Trae Young, Lou Williams  Underrated by the eye test: Rudy Gobert, Al Horford, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook (at times)"
"His athleticism is more impressive than say Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Kevin Garnett, Derrick Rose, James Harden, Shaquille O'Neal, Vince Carter, and a bunch others?  You can argue a few of those, but the fact that he isnt clear top 5 at all does not help his case.  And just looking at athleticism is kinda pointless. Jeremy Lin was exceptionally talented atheltically but it never came to fruition outside of a season or two.  Blake was talented but it never manifested anywhere and he only has a single season basically as a point forward.  I just dont think you are considering a lot of the decade here and how talented the players that have come through the NBA in that time"
"Speak for yourself, I've never spoken one ill word towards the 2017 NBA MVP Russell Westbrook."
Soft ass parents like Russell Westbrook.
"I'm also pretty unconvinced that you're going to shoot 36% from 3 that series with Russell Westbrook on the team, tbh."
Yeah fucking hyper elite 3 point shooter Russell Westbrook is going to have a better eFG?  Do you actually watch basketball?
I want people to start speedrunning Russell Westbrook ejections. Let's see someone show up to a game with a giant timer and see how long it takes.

The only person who’s ever corroborated that Westbrook was called racial epithets is Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook.
"Good ole Russell ""James Dolan"" Westbrook..."
"Yeah I’m legit kind of offended by this as a fan. Players do not have the right to kick out fans, let alone ones who haven’t crossed any type of line.   Why should I pay for a ticket if Russell Westbrook can point his finger at me for booing him and get me kicked the fuck out"
"Russell ""James Dolan"" Westbrook"
Russell “Cersei” Westbrook
"westbrook is such a bitch. i used to be a big fan of his and now after the last few years i don't like him at all (he does this shit so much, he's shitty to people, fans, reporters). to get someone ejected for saying he's a joke is just way beyond ridiculous. jazz should give this dude tickets to another game.  westbrook is more petty than jim dolan. what happened to being able to taunt the other team? this dude didn't say anything racist. he didn't say anything fucked up, no cursing, nothing serious at all. he said he's a joke, didn't even say his name or anything and westbrook got him kicked out. i honestly hope westbrook never wins a ring. he's such a piece of shit.   &amp;#x200B;  i read the other shit the guy said too now, none of it was even a big deal. the security guards just need to start ignoring westbrook. that's bullshit that he can get opposing fans kicked out for taunting him when they don't even say anything that serious. if you aren't saying a bunch of racist, shitty stuff about religion, about their family or anything that is extremely serious like threatening then they shouldn't kick someone out. i would love to hear what kevin garnett has to say about how big of a bitch russell westbrook is."
"&gt;Right, so there he is, high and mighty Russell Westbrook, ears jiggling in the breeze. All of a sudden he looks my way. Gives me a little smile like, ""Well?"" So, all right, you know, I've never been shy and I'm blessed with my triple doubles, so I put them right out."
All these fake ass answers when it's always been Russell Westbrook
"Okay so Russell Westbrook should never be able to say a single bad thing about an opponent again, other he should be ejected immediately. If players want to say fans can't talk shit then it should run both ways and plays should not be allowed to say anything that could ever be taken as offensive to anyone while playing. Westbrook is the softest person I have ever seen."
What's the difference between Russell Westbrook and Michael Scott?  Michael Scott ain't no bitch.
James Harden and Russell Westbrook
"I’m the biggest Russell Westbrook fan on planet earth, but what the fuck? How is that ejectable?"
You can always see the age of this sub come out when Russ is posted. A bunch of kids calling Russell Westbrook of all people soft
Russell westbrook is such a baby. NBA players are so soft

Shit. Russell Westbrook blows KD completely out of the water here. He dominates everyone not named LeBron in just about every single category. Aside from his abysmal TS%, Russ finishes: 2nd in PER, 1st in OREB%, 2nd best in TRB%, 1st in AST%(by FAR), 1st in STL%, 1st in USG%, 2nd in WS/48, 1st in OBPM, 2nd in DBPM, 2nd in BPM, and 2nd in VORP. In almost EVERY category, Russ is either 1st, or 2nd behind LeBron James. Nobody else even comes close to him in the advanced stats department. Pretty impressive for someone who only pads counting stats at the expense of his team.  &gt;Meanwhile, KD finished: last in PER, 2nd last in TS%, last in ORB%, 3rd in TRB%, last in AST%, last in STL%, tied for 2nd for USG%, last in WS/48, last in OBPM,  2nd last in DBPM, last in BPM, and last in VORP. Hmmm, not what I expected from someone who carried Russ every year. Abysmal showing from KD here.  &gt;So not only was Russ clearly better than KD in terms of counting stats, but he also dominated KD (and everyone else) when looking at their advanced metrics. But of course, stats don't tell the whole story. Let's take a deeper look at each series that year and how both of them performed.  How does this mainly use BPM?"

you can’t name twenty players better than russell westbrook   what the fuck
Kuzma is a clown. Can't stand these young bois trying to be the next Russell Westbrook rather than the next Jordan.
"What? I definitely don't see best player in the league in him. Perennial All-Star (although he is in the West) maybe but best player - no. Hell, him being an All-Star may not be a given considering how loaded the guard position is in the West from young to established players. You've got James Harden and Stephen Curry as locks whenever healthy. Then you have up and comers like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Luka Dončić, DeAaron Fox, DeAngelo Russell and SGA. Also Russell Westbrook and Damian Lillard exist."
"People legitimately still believe that Westbrook is a top-10 player, so it’s either him or D’Angelo Russell.  Also, a few players that are overrated by more casual fans : Sabonis, Steven Adams, Avery Bradley, Dion Waiters, John Wall and DeRozan  One more thing, Porzingis has gotten like really good defensively, and while his inefficiency sucks, he’s playing the best overall basketball of his career and is a big part of why Luka is playing at such a high level. He definitely isn’t underrated."
"PBev, Lou, and TRez  Hayward  Russell Westbrook"
So Russell Westbrook is better than Kawhi using this logic?
"&gt;Who did the Blazers get swept by then?  How did AD do in the regular season as the sole superstar on his team?  &gt;Making the conference finals in the east is better than losing in the first round in the west.   PG made Conference Finals in 2013 and 2014. Russ got fucked up by Pat Bev in 2013 and made Conference Finals in 2014.  PG has obviously had less playoffs success since then yet you're only criticising Russ.  &gt;Okay now you’re just being delusional.   You gonna make an actual argument? Because there's nothing delusional about that statement lol.  ||Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MP|PTS|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| |Kevin Durant|.423|.286|.918|41.3|30.0|8.0|2.9|1.7|1.7| |Russell Westbrook|.395|.317|.820|39.1|26.7|7.0|11.3|3.7|0.0|  &gt;Much to my surprise, Russ and KD had roughly the same efficiency this series. KD's HORRIBLE 3pt shooting streak continued in the WCF. He once again played more minutes and scored more PPG than Russ, but Russ once again put up almost 4x as many assists and over twice as many steals as KD while playing fewer minutes.  ||Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Player|TS%|eFG%|ORB%|DRB%|TRB%|AST%|STL%|USG%|ORtg|DRtg|GmSc| |Kevin Durant|.539|.458|2.3|17.8|10.1|12.4|2.0|31.9|106|106|20.1| |Russell Westbrook|.509|.436|5.4|13.2|9.3|50.3|4.6|32.6|109|104|23.0|  &gt;KD had a slightly higher TS%, but Westbrook once again dominates every single other category. Same story as the rest of the playoffs. It's worth noting that KD played like complete garbage the last 2 games of the series, where just one win would have punched in the Thunder's ticket to the finals.  &gt;It's tough to make a judgement on this series, but I still think Russ was better in the WCF because of his outstanding overall play, especially considering his playmaking, defense, and excellent play in transition."
Over time people are gonna pretend that the 16-17 okc thunder is made up of 14 late career Jamal Crawford and Russell Westbrook.
"48 win team??? Im calling bullshit unless u can prove it. Their over/under was 32.5 for this season and they were a 48 win team with Westbrook/George the past 2 years........So ur basically saying u expected them to stay at the same level despite replacing Russell Westbrook and Paul George with a 35yo point guard who most were calling washed up heading into the season, a rookie about to hit his sophomore year and an injury prone but solid wing in Gallo"
One regular season game and this sub acts like he’s a scrub. And his name isn’t even Russell Westbrook... smh
"&gt;Yeah, but let's say that the current Celtics roster were able to just add Gobert for Kanter (picked because their the current best team where Gobert could be considered the best player imo), they'd be a lot better but do you now like their chances more than the Bucks, Rockets, Lakers or Clippers now?  I mean, if they're a team w/ the 5th best chance of winning they're a contender, aren't they?  Not sure what point you're trying to make here anymore tbh.    &gt; I think you need a a top 5ish superstar if you want any hope of making the Finals.  Disagree with that.  &gt;They all had that 'dark horse' vibe that the Jazz have had for a while, where they're underdogs against anyone with a MVP-caliber star.  I mean, Jazz beat then-MVP Russell Westbrook with PG a few seasons back.  Having a top 5 guy obviously helps, but I don't think it's a requirement.  Obviously the issue is recently we've had a bunch of superteams emerging, and Bron has run the East, but I don't think it's reasonable to dismiss anyone without a top 5 guy from contention.    For Utah specifically, if Donny makes the leap, that's two (by my reckoning) guys just below the top top tier surrounded by near-stars in Conley &amp; Bojan, solid role players, and a very good coach.  I think that's a team which has a chance.    &gt;A while back, I tried to make my hand at some non-superstar teams that include Gobert but none of them made me feel confident that they could make the Finals.  I mean... a couple of those are legitimately 5 all-stars in the starting 5.  CP3, Beal, Butler, Gordon, Gobert, for instance, is a team with more than enough talent to be a contender.  There's then issues like chemistry, and Butler is arguably better than Rudy atm, but anyone who looks at that team and tells you they're not a contender is nuts."
russell fucking westbrook.   russ is not going to let harden get apathetic &amp; flame out in the playoffs.  they’re childhood friends &amp; can hold one another accountable  watch.
"It’s a win for the defense *if* it’s a bad shot for a player.  LaMarcus Aldridge to take a 18ft turnaround isn’t as good as a layup, but there’s still a high probability of him scoring.  When Russell Westbrook one his MVP, part of the reason he was so dangerous is he was like 50% on all jump shooting.  It’s hard enough to guard a guy way faster than you.  It’s impossible when he can fake penetrate and pull up for a 15 ft bank shot with 6 ft of space."
Since no one else has the balls to do it:  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: James Harden  SF: Luka Doncic  PF: Giannis  C: Anthony Davis  We've seen KD knocked to 2nd team cause of the logjam at the F position. Luka and Giannis have been playing better than Bron so it's 2nd team for him.  Also very weak year for PG play.
This Celtics team is an enigma. They’re like the Russell Westbrook version of a team: the ceiling is incredible but the floor is so low.  Also Trae Young that troll looking fucker looks so good out there.
"The reason is Harden is playing with better players. Everyone says Harden has no help because he is scoring 40 ppg, but his teammates are FAR from garbage, and not nearly as injured as other teams in the league.  - Russell Westbrook is a former MVP, and has proven his ability to drag a team to the playoffs by himself in the West. - Clint Capela is a fucking beast, enough said. - The rest of the players (PJ, Gerald Green, Eric Gordon, etc) have been in and out throughout the season, but are generally quality starters.  Most people can't name Mavs players outside of Luka and KP, and most came from the bench elsewhere. KP has also been pedestrian at best. Yet the Mavs are only 1.5 games back on the Rockets.  Stats-wise, do the +9 ppg on slightly better efficiency outweigh 4 rpg and an extra assist? Maybe so. But is it that huge? And even moreso, do those points matter if the difference is 1.5 games in the West standings?"
"""If smaller guys are on me I abuse them like they should be""  Russell Westbrook 2 days ago."

Russell Westbrook is literally Jameis Winston. When this guy is not on he stinks. like really stinks.
it must be such an emotional rollercoaster being a russell westbrook fan

"Guys who have a had more points per 100 possessions than 2019-2020 Giannis so far:  2018-2019 James Harden  1986-1987 Michael Jordan  2005-2006 Kobe Bryant  2016-2017 Russell Westbrook  The only one to also have a higher rTS% is Harden.  Also, does anyone have insight to what the per 100 numbers would be like for Wilt?"

"The way he pass is like normal pass that all playmaker can do. What I mean is crazy PG passes like no look pass, ball deflected pass, behind the back pass or drive to the basket and pass to the perimeter guy type. The guy who has what I mean is the best PG of all time - Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, John Stockton, Russell Westbrook, Jason Williams, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, CP3 and Rajon Rondo. Lebron has a glimpse of it but not simi;ar to what I say whilst guy like Doncic, Steph and Lillard are not. Those three guys is amazing playmaker but their passes are nothing unique. PG is the one position that the way they showboating is through the kind of passes they make."

[looks at Russell Westbrook]
But fr. We're going to see godlike Russell Westbrook from this point on. He's not coming down from where he's been in 2020
"Since the start of the 16-17 season, the Jazz are 12-21 without Gobert.  With him, they are 170-94, which is a 53-win pace, and they've made it to the second round of the playoffs twice, which is as far or farther than teams led by Anthony Davis, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, etc... have made it."
"Lowe literally said Westbrook wasn't an All-Star a month ago.  E : found an article , not the actual pod where he talks about it.  https://fadeawayworld.net/2020/01/14/zach-lowe-thinks-russell-westbrook-is-not-an-all-star-this-year/"
"Edit: Oh you meant the actual OP / thread creator  Ask /u/Classics22, but which part is wrong btw for Westbrook? The 27/8/7 is correct, although he actually has more turnovers (4.4)  https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook"
Ok: Did you just try to call Russell Westbrook “Brook?”
Did you just call Russell Westbrook “Book?”
"Russell Westbrook should not be an all star they tellin me   Side note, Honestly If Ben Simmons is *that* opposed to shooting 3s he should play a similar game style. All he has to do is get a respectable midrange."
russell westbrook
"Russell Westbrook and losing to ridiculous 3 point shots, name a more iconic duo."
"&gt;Lamar just had a lot better regular season than Mahomes.  Lol so what? Russell Westbrook won MVP but nobody thought he was actually the best player. Regular season accolades are meaningless.  &gt;Lamar is pretty close based on his abilities and performance this past year  Lol you must not even watch the NFL. Lamar can't even throw a spiral  &gt;Also Waton and Russell are pretty damn good too without the weapons KC has  They are great, both better than Lamar, but neither of them are nearly as good of passers as Mahomes."
"Lol that's not true. Steph is better at making those shots, but every player in the league is still capable of hitting those shots if they are on their game. Mahomes makes throws that every other QB is literally physically incapable of making.   &gt;Lamar Jackson plays the same position as Mahomes and won the MVP over him this season.   Lmao so? Did you think Russell Westbrook was better than LeBron when he won MVP? You clearly don't even watch the NFL"
"Gave out untradeable contracts like Russell Westbrook’s and was only tradable to a equal untradeable contract. One off-season? Khris has been there forever, Ersan came back because he was drafted there and his family was still their. Brook Lopez has always been good and proved it in a year he was on the min. And Giannis is a human freak of nature who is better than Westbrook.  Won’t argue about Presti’s drafting though. Dude has a fetish for defensive minded, athletic wings, we have arguably 3-4 that were drafted recently"
"&gt; He's arguably not even the best QB (Lamar Jackson's about to win unanimous MVP ....  Lol and did you think Russell Westbrook was better than LeBron the year he won MVP? You clearly don't watch the NFL    &gt;More importantly, Mahomes is not a ""transcendent"" player. He's a damn good young QB, but he's not changing the game.   LeBron and Kobe never changed the game, so do you not consider them transcendent?"
"Lol don't pull the flair buill shit and act like you're impartial...  &gt;And what do you mean actually fouled? When a guy puts his shoulder down like that, refs call that charge 99% of the time  Lol no.  1. The contact is initiated by Schroder who is out of position after getting caught by the screen and steps forward in to cut Smart off. If you want a charge call you have to be in a defensive position.     You can't just step in front of someone and fall to the ground. You have to give people space to continue their forward movement, even when you're trying to cut them off defensively.    2. Even if he was in a defensive position, they don't call that 90% of the time in favour of the defender. I'm guessing you've watched enough Russell Westbrook driving to the rim to know better...   &gt;Everyone throws their head back, not many act like they slipped on a banana peel  1. Not many people get hit so egregiously. It was a pretty clean hit. 2. He sold it but it was still a foul. You can't put your hand up and into someone's face."
Russell “not an all star” Westbrook
No he goes by Russell Westbrook now.
Russell Westbrook
russell westbrook is gonna fuck around and end up top 5 in mvp voting this year
"This year in particular they had Billy Donovan already.  Their issue was lack of spacing and Russell Westbrook for YEARS taking more shots per game than the greatest offensive talent since MJ and Kobe.  KD and y'all can say whatever you want, Westbrook drived him crazy and drived me crazy when you would look at a playoff game and he would have 31 FGA and KD had 18... And that's not even mentioning the ridiculously bad spacing with Adams/Roberson/Ibaka on the court at the same time.  He made the right decision and god bless him. He saw what LeBron did in 2010 and did the same, but better and it resulted in two championships that should've been three if not for injuries."
"Yet, that team was so good it needed Russell Westbrook averaging 31-10-10 to barely make the playoffs and get bounced in the first round after he left. Then, the next year it got a Top 15 player in the league and STILL couldn't make past the first round with all those ""great players"".  KD consistently led that cast of players to the WCF while he was there with a team that didn't fit and a point guard that for many years took more shots than him because he ain't no point guard.  KD never lost a playoff series with OKC in which they were the better team and since he left, OKC didn't get past the first round."
"People saying that KD showing up in game 7 is a myth. He took 19 shots compared to 30 in the previous game. You can't only take 19 shots if you are the best scorer in the world in a game 7. Most of his attempts came in the last 2 or 3 minutes of the game where the warriors had the game wrapped up.   In the Warriors series specifically, in game 3 and 4 where the series turned for the Thunder, Russell Westbrook was clearly the best player in the series. The entire narrative back then was that Westbrook was out playing the unanimous MVP. Then we all know what happened in the next few games."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2017/11/29/victor-oladipo-praises-russell-westbrook-during-career-year-i-learned-so-much-from-him/amp/  &gt;Oladipo is adamant about having no issues with Westbrook—or his style of play. On the contrary, he calls Westbrook a close friend and attributes some the success he’s enjoyed this so far this season to spending a year watching him.  &gt;“I learned so much from Russ,” he says. “Just his mindset, how relentless he is, those are things I’ve definitely taken with me.”  Dipo has always gushed about his time playing with Russ"
"I'd argue Luka deserves MVP over LeBron:  Dude's averaging 29.1 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 9 assists per game at 20 years old during his 2nd year in the NBA all while leading the mavericks to a 4/5 seed in STACKED western conference.     For reference these are the stats Russell Westbrook had during his MVP year while leading OKC to only a 6th seed:     31.6 ppg   10.7 rpg   10.4 apg"
"People need to get off that.  Westbrook had the best individual statistical season, the only thing voters did was relax the arbitrary ""requirement"" that the MVP come from a top-2 seed in order to reward the guy who actually played the best individual basketball and [added the most to his team](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/).  That's completely different from just making up a storyline to give a less deserving player the award."
"I don't know about that. A quick Google doesn't yield any results, and [this](https://www.sbnation.com/2016/7/29/12322888/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-return-thunder-rumor) article would seem to disprove it."
"i mean, he's right though. russell westbrook has great stats but he isnt a winner. if he was a winner, what has he won?"
"Truly a beautiful moment. Waving goodbye to Russell ""I've been busting his ass for years"" Westbrook."
"There was a post a while back that argued Russ was OKC's best player in the 2016 playoffs and was easily their best player in the WCF.  ###Round 3: vs. Golden State Warriors  ||Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MP|PTS|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| |Kevin Durant|.423|.286|.918|41.3|30.0|8.0|2.9|1.7|1.7| |Russell Westbrook|.395|.317|.820|39.1|26.7|7.0|11.3|3.7|0.0|  Wow. This is definitely the most controversial series of the three. There was a ton of discussion over who ""choked the series away"". I'm not going to go into detail regarding that as this OC is already long enough, but let's take a look at their series numbers.  Much to my surprise, Russ and KD had roughly the same efficiency this series. KD's HORRIBLE 3pt shooting streak continued in the WCF. He once again played more minutes and scored more PPG than Russ, but Russ once again put up almost 4x as many assists and over twice as many steals as KD while playing fewer minutes.  ||Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Player|TS%|eFG%|ORB%|DRB%|TRB%|AST%|STL%|USG%|ORtg|DRtg|GmSc| |Kevin Durant|.539|.458|2.3|17.8|10.1|12.4|2.0|31.9|106|106|20.1| |Russell Westbrook|.509|.436|5.4|13.2|9.3|50.3|4.6|32.6|109|104|23.0|  KD had a higher TS%, but Westbrook once again dominates every single other category. Same story as the rest of the playoffs. It's worth noting that KD played like complete garbage the last 2 games of the series, where just one win would have punched in the Thunder's ticket to the finals.  It's tough to make a judgement on this series, but I still think Russ was better in the WCF because of his outstanding overall play, especially considering his playmaking, defense, and excellent play in transition."
And Russell 'chopped liver' Westbrook
"This is Giannis's 13th game with a double-double and 9 assists. This is compared to just 18 triple-doubles.  For comparison, Russell Westbrook has 16 double-doubles with 9 assists, compared to 146 triple-doubles."
https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2019/03/16/utah-jazz-fans-have/  https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/15/russell-westbrook-fan-abuse-utah-jazz-racist
"Also, Billy Donovan got a ton of shit last postseason after the Blazers stomped on the Thunder, but I thought none of that criticism was deserved (and was really just borne out of lots of folks overrating the Thunder because of ""talent"").  The Blazers knew they could just trap and double team Paul George to get the ball out of his hands, and pack the paint to stop Russell Westbrook and others from driving to the rim easily. The Blazers bet on guys like Russ/Grant/Ferguson/etc. not being able to beat them with jump shots, and that bet paid off handsomely with a quick 5-game series victory.  Fundamentally, there was nothing Donovan could have done to adjust to whatever the Blazers did, because he just didn't have the personnel to punish the Blazers for packing the paint and double teaming Paul George."
"I love Russell Westbrook but this season has clearly shown it was mostly on him. Sure, BD should’ve done more to keep him in check, but I think the offense stalling was mostly on Russ."
Russell Westbrook will appreciate it.
Russell “not a starting PG” Westbrook  He needs to embrace his role as a 6th man!!
"Russell westbrook is not better. Dame is a better shooter and more clutch. With westbrook you're tanking percentages. Also dame isn't just a scorer, his passing has improved his passing has improved this year. He's doing all of this on a team that is significantly worse than last year's."
"Full quotes:  ""Sam Presti stood pat.  And when you had the kind of summer that he did, with the Oklahoma City general manager pulling off trades with the Clippers, Houston and Denver that left the Thunder with 15 first-round picks in the next seven years (if they all convey) and three pick swaps, who could blame him? Especially with the stunning amount of fun his Thunder are having in this post-Russell Westbrook/Paul George era.  Despite the extensive talks between Oklahoma City and Miami about Thunder forward Danilo Gallinari heading to the Heat, that deal didn’t go down in the end. According to The Ringer, the failed extension talks between the Heat and Gallinari’s group played a part.  It’s worth sharing, though, that Gallinari is known to be extremely fond of this Thunder team and all the surprising success that it has been enjoying. If OKC (31-20) wasn’t sitting here in the sixth spot in the West, with just a game-and-a-half separating the Thunder and Houston in the fourth spot that earns you homecourt in the playoffs, then a free-agent-to-be like Gallinari might have been a whole lot more motivated to push his way out of the Thunder’s program.  Alas, we get to see how far they can take this surprise season while Presti ponders what to do with that treasure trove of assets that he so deftly earned.""o do with that treasure trove of assets that he so deftly earned."""
I mean there is a reason why past players have said they hate playing in utah because of the racism they experience from the crowds  https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/ny-sports-utah-jazz-ban-fans-russell-westbrook-20190315-story.html
"Our center, Russell Westbrook, was missing"
All this tells me is that Russell Westbrook is the most impactful rebounder in the league
Don't forget Reggie Jackson forced his way out of OKC because we didn't let him start over Russell Westbrook in 2014.
"Bruh you really gonna say it's because Russell Westbrook is out? Cmon dude, it's the Suns Rockets getting exposed."
&gt;Russell Westbrook
have you heard of this guy called Russell Westbrook
"&gt; Even if he's shooting 20% it'll be an asset if he only takes like 1 or 2 a game  How can that be an asset? The team average for 3pt% is 35.1%. If Ben is taking two a game at 20% instead of passing it to a teammate to shoot the three then that's roughly one successful three pointer wasted every three games. So if one in every three of their close wins last season becomes a loss, instead of the 3rd seed they'd become the 5th seed. That could have season ending ramifications for the team. All because fans want to see Ben attempt some low percentage threes. You might argue that shooting them more would make him better in the long run......well, tell that to Russell Westbrook. Doesn't always work that way."
"I gotta admit, watching Russ against the Lakers was insane.  The Rockets were pretty bad tbh, outside of some decent 3pt shooting.  They were getting dominated in the paint, beat up on rebounds, etc.  EXCEPT FOR RUSSELL WESTBROOK!  That dude played like a fucking superstar.  He was unstoppable.  Double teams didn't even work.  They all knew he was gonna slash for the hole or pull up at the line, and no one could do a damn thing about it.  I'm always super impressed when a guy is unstoppable at anything other than shooting from 3.  anyone can get hot shooting from 3.  It takes fucking SKILL and ATHLETICISM to do what he did yesterday.  Hats off"
Damn I nearly forgot it's Russell Westbrook day today! What a coincidence!
"I don't know how any team with Russell Westbrook on it can be the most boring, for better or worse."
TIL Russell Westbrook does BBQ.
Russell freaking Westbrook.
Here are my pitches that I took two minutes to come up with.  1)  Mr H.O.R.S.E - a bunch of disgruntled programmers team up for a techno heist against Daryl Morey and the Rockets that is centered on erasing every basketball analytical database in existence.  2) The Good Team - A generational rookie gets drafted onto the Sacramento Kings where he naively believes that they're rebuilding into a team for the future only to discover that the Kings are tanking... forever! Rest of the show deals with a rookie singlehandedly trying to build the team's FO/Culture/Team from scratch  3) Dear Tall People - This follows a youtube channel of an outspoken and talented street baller who's only obstacle to making it pro was his lack of height. This fella and his short brethren travel the country embarassing long bois on the court.  4) Westworld - An animated adult sci-fi basketball comedy where in the future every player in the league is a different clone/mutation of Russell Westbrook.  5) Toronsparent - It follows the trials and tribulations of Lebron James as he attempts to raise his newly adopted Canadian family in a world not much suited for a busy working father.
Does it really bother you that much that the sidebar is honoring a dead legend less than 2 weeks after his passing as opposed to having a picture of Russell Westbrook or whoever had a good game last night?
"1st team: G: James Harden G: Luka Doncic F: LeBron James F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Nikola Jokic  2nd team: G: Damian Lillard G: Russell Westbrook  F: Kawhi Leonard F: Anthony Davis  C: Rudy Gobert  3rd team: G: Trae Young G: Donovan Mitchell F: Khris Middleton  F: Pascal Siakam C: Bam Adebayo   I believe third team is the trickiest. You have guys with great stats like Booker, Beal, Trae, and Lavine, but their team record is not good. Then you have players like Kemba, Lowry, and Mitchell who are also putting up good numbers,  and their teams are winning, but players like Trae, Booker, and Beal have superior stats.   It’s a toss up, but I think Trae deserves it despite his team record. 29/5/9 with good efficiency. Mitchell is also putting up 25/4/4 on good efficiency with a winning team, so he has a good argument as well.  Then the center position is wide open. If Embiid plays better, he may have an argument over Adebayo.  Forward spot is a toss up between Ingram, Middleton, Tatum, and Butler. All have legitimate cases."
are y’all dumb..  stop disrespecting russell fuckin westbrook.
"because i was comparing him to every player in the league.  &gt; 56TS for a player with &gt;30USG is pretty good  Westbrook over the season is at a 52.7% TS, which makes him literally the least efficient player with &gt;30% USG. obviously Steph and Dion have barely played this season, but they fit the criteria too.  |||||Crit|Crit|Tota| |-:|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|Season|Tm|USG%|TS%|G| |1|Damian Lillard|2019-20|POR|30.5|.623|50| |2|James Harden|2019-20|HOU|36.6|.617|48| |3|Giannis Antetokounmpo|2019-20|MIL|37.9|.611|47| |4|Trae Young|2019-20|ATL|34.9|.598|47| |5|Kyrie Irving|2019-20|BRK|32.5|.595|20| |6|Luka Doni|2019-20|DAL|37.2|.589|43| |7|Paul George|2019-20|LAC|30.8|.586|30| |8|Joel Embiid|2019-20|PHI|31.8|.583|36| |9|Kawhi Leonard|2019-20|LAC|33.9|.579|39| |10|Bradley Beal|2019-20|WAS|33.2|.577|42| |11|LeBron James|2019-20|LAL|31.3|.572|48| |12|Zach LaVine|2019-20|CHI|31.4|.564|53| |13|Derrick Rose|2019-20|DET|30.9|.564|44| |14|DAngelo Russell|2019-20|GSW|32.1|.558|33| |15|Donovan Mitchell|2019-20|UTA|31.2|.558|49| |16|Stephen Curry|2019-20|GSW|33.8|.548|4| |17|Spencer Dinwiddie|2019-20|BRK|30.1|.539|50| |18|Dion Waiters|2019-20|MIA|31.0|.530|3| |19|Russell Westbrook|2019-20|HOU|33.9|.527|43|"

"i was more so answering the specific question of how to force A player to initiate in the perimeter, not so much how to force russell westbrook to"
"Russ played at an historic level that year in a way that has never been done before. [If Westbrook had played as many possessions per game that season as Robertson did in 1961-62, he would have averaged an unfathomable 56.0 points, 18.9 rebounds and 18.4 assists.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2853074-russell-westbrook-vs-oscar-robertson-the-battle-of-triple-double-maestros)  Nephews on this sub who didn't actually watch him play that year have no idea the level of impact he had on the squad, how basically every game he looked like the best player on the floor, regardless of who he was playing against. Some guys were better at basketball than him, but he always put in more effort than everybody else. I watched almost every game that year because of him, and i'm from romania lol"
Who would have thought that Russell Westbrook could enter a 2nd prime lmao.
"Russell Westbrook: -Jacked? Mother fucker looks like a superhero, even among his peers  -Freshest clothes? Not my taste personally, but dude definitely knows how to dress  -Chillest restaurants? He’s a multimillionaire celebrity athlete, he can get into any food joint he wants, no reservation required  -Hottest dudes? Hangs out with the most athletic men in the entire world, who can all get some of the finest tail normal men can only dream of  The rare moment when a pasta is actually somehow unironically true."
On russell westbrook day of all days
"In the Miami vs Spurs Finals series', the Spurs always dared Wade and Bron to shoot jumpers.  Last season, we saw the Raptors run a box and one at Steph Curry in the playoffs.  We saw (as OKC fans) the past 3 seasons, teams have dared Russ and really anyone else not named Paul George to shoot in the playoffs.  **My point is the playoffs are BUILT on gimmicky defenses. Why can't a gimmicky offense work?**  In reality, you have to think about match ups and who the Rockets will play. Based off their roster, this is genius. This is the most effective way to utilize Russell Westbrook and Harden and Gordon and House and Tucker. Offensively, the Rockets are going to be hard to stop (as they already have been) -- that ain't changing and it might get even more ridiculous. This is a team that scored 150+ this year.  They won't see a team with AD every night or every play off series. I think it may not work and end in a ship this season but I think it will surprise a lot of people."
"Russell Westbrook does not have a more positive impact on the game than any of: LeBron, Kawhi, AD, Harden, Giannis, Luka, Embiid, PG13, Jokic, Gobert, Dame, or Butler. I could name more but yeah that's 12 that are just straight out better at winning basketball games than Russ"
&gt;	because i am homosexual  Welcome to r/nba!  &gt;	for Russell Westbrook  oh no
"And you would win that bet. Last-placed Barkley (.266, 2020 attempts) is almost a full 4% behind the guy in front of him - Russell Westbrook (.304, 3172 attempts)."
yeah but now they also have Russell fucking Westbrook when they don’t fall
"I've seen that since the Mavs without Luka OR KP shut down Harden, and looked like they were take a W in Houston..with 4 min left in the game, Russell Westbrook happened."
"Skill level is going to go up every era depending on what skills are needed + modern players having access to far more training/ nutrition. You couldn't rely on physicality to score or dribble the ball anywhere off the top, which meant beating people off the dribble was extremely difficult in the 60s. Skills that guys like Westbrook are completely dependent on. There were freaks back then that would be the top athletes today - Russell, Thurmond, Elgin Baylor, Chamberlain, etc. - but their efficiency is much lower due to the rules limiting physical advantage."

Russell Westbrook ain’t no spot up shooter he ain’t gotta run to the corner to shoot like he’s some 3rd option bitch this ain’t jj redick this is a fucking god human Oscar Robertson come again only this time he’s not a pussy fuckin average a triple double and fight you at the same time
because i am homosexual for Russell Westbrook
Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook
it works out tho cuz then 4v3 with 3 shooters and Russell fucking Westbrook
Russell Westbrook too...
Without question Russell Westbrook
2020 Rockets pick your poison:  James Harden 1-on-1  Russell Westbrook 3-on-4
Where is the stat to represent the fact Russell Westbrook took his manhood?
"He was gassed from running and shoving with thicc asses all game. They were eating early game due to lenght but you got to remember you have fucking Russell Westbrook going coast to coast all game, and Harden dancing on you in the halfcourt.... then you have to move that canon ball PJ Tucker. It has to be exhausting for a big guy"
"He will. And it gonna be fucking beautiful. My man Russell Westbrook will finally get the ring he deserves, through all the haters, snakes, and missed 3 pointers. Russell Westbrook will be an NBA champion."
Tell me at which point over the last 10 years would you have picked Russell to be on your team over KD (when healthy) or LeBron?   The answer is never. Russell Westbrook has literally never once in his life had an argument to be the best player in the league
"No he wasn't. Literally not a single team in the league would have drafted him 1st if all players were available. Russell Westbrook has never been close to being the best player in the league, he's never even had an argument for it."
It's literally the first time in his career that he's been surrounded by shooters and where him not shooting the three is the more intelligent decision.  I guarantee that you're not a more intelligent basketball player than Russell Westbrook lol.
I love Russell Westbrook. Bruins for life baby
In recent memory probably the Russell Westbrook and fan debacle. All time probably MJ hits gw in game 6 or a headline about Karl Malone and what he did.

I love Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is my best friend
Trade Simmon's for Russell Westbrook. Russ will get his points and still deliever the same rebounding and assists Simmon's does. I am sick of watching Simmons's passive ass.
"KAT is worth more than Russell Westbrook, look at that trade then try again"
Get used to that mediocre on/off numbers and elite coach getting carried by elite coach and deep bench while putting up Monta Ellis on steroids with Russell Westbrook style rebounding.
"There are 6 spots right with Harden/Doncic locks for the starters basically   so 4 spots for:  - Devin Booker - Donovan Mitchell - Jrue Holiday - CJ McCollum - D'Angelo Russell - Damian Lillard - Chris Paul - Russell Westbrook - Ja Morant   I think we can take Russell, CJ, Jrue out  so:  - Devin Booker - Donovan Mitchell - Damian Lillard - Chris Paul - Russell Westbrook - Ja Morant   Mitchell should get in given his teams performance. CP3 should get in as the sole rep from a team which is making the playoffs.  So 2 spots for Dame, WB, Booker, Morant   IMO MEM isn't dependent on Morant quite yet, so it's really Dame vs WB vs Booker.    The argument for WB out of the 3 would be Wins as the other two have better stats.    My personal feeling has always been teams with losing records shouldn't get all stars - I'd rather the format be 3AS for #1 team, 2 for (2/3), and 1 for (4-8) but that's just me."
"I just used Embiid as a random example of a good scoring center &amp; wasn't intending to argue that Gobert is specifically better or worse as a scorer than him, so I think I get what you were saying with Embiid being better. And your Adams comp is helpful too.  I don't think I gave a very good example though. I should have said that it's my opinion that, for example, IF both Embiid &amp; Gobert both missed 30 straight games for their teams right now after playing at 100% all season, and IF both teams replaced them with the exact same cloned back-up center w/no other changes to their teams roster &amp; rotations, the numbers show that Utah would have a much larger decline in overall offensive rating--or more simply, the team's offense would just get worse-- than Philly's would w/out Embiid. So in that regard, Gobert is more valuable to Utah offensively than Embiid is to Philly.  Regarding your Adams/Gobert comparison, you're right on that they contribute offensively in similar areas like screening, p&amp;r, rim-running, Oreb's, &amp; stretching the z-axis near the rim; instead of post-up offense, perimeter shooting, etc...  The difference is that I think that while I think Adams is good at those skills, Rudy is so much better at doing those things effectively/better that his team's overall offense is improved noticably in both overall scoring &amp; efficiency more than if Adams was doing the same things for them.   And again, I think that gets to the point I think this article was making. Gobert's the best in the game at what he does do on offense. And because of that, the Jazz offense as a whole is better than it would be if he was a 25-30 pt/gm scorer w/a higher utilization rate like Embiid or KAT that DIDN'T/COULDN'T do the off-ball offensive work Gobert does BECAUSE the offense needs to have/get the ball in his hands in order for him to score.  So just like Russell Westbrook is a definitively better scorer than Chris Paul, Houston is a definitively better offense with CP3 as the starting PG. Because teams are better offensively overall when their point guard can orchestrate &amp; pass at a higher level instead of score. So a great pass-first PG is better to have on a team than an equally great scoring PG.  Similarly, an elite Center whose great at what Gobert does is going to make a team's offense better overall than an elite Center that is equally great at scoring like KAT or Embiid.  I hope that clarifies my point better."
Russell Westbrook is the best looking Ninja turtle. Now give Reddit money
"Jeremy Lin has more rings than Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, A.I, Steve Nash and John Stockton combined"
"The tallest player in NBA history, Manute Bol, weights as heavy as Russell Westbrook, 200 pounds."
"Patrick McCaw has more championships rings than James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and CP3 combined."
worse that year. Russell Westbrook won it as the 47-win 67th seed
So you believe that Russell Westbrook was the #1 player in the league at one point?   I dont think Luka plays like Westbrook but its more than raw numbers and top 5 players lead teams deep into the playoffs. I would just like it if we apply that standard to Luka as well. I would have no problem calling him that if he makes that kind of noise in the playoffs this year.
"Definite outs from last year: KD, Steph, Dipo, Russell, Wade, Klay, Dirk  Possible outs: Lowry, Westbrook, Middleton, Griffin, Vucevic, Aldridge  Leaves up to 13 new ins. Realistically, probably 8-9. 2 of those spots filled by old guys, replacing Wade and Dirk (if they're doing that again).  Other possible ins, who have made it before: Drummond, Butler. So maybe 6 new guys this year, 8 if they get rid of the old guy spot."
My point is that every single advanced statistic thinks he's a good defender and the eye test does too. None of them are individually perfect but generally if a player grades out as a good defender in pretty much every single metric then they're a good defender  Or do you have a reason you think he's not a good defender beyond Russell Westbrook saying it one time
"As individual players, Irving is much more skilled.   On a shit team, Irving is not going to help much. He can’t carry a shit team to the playoffs.  On a championship contender, Irving would be a great ceiling raiser.   As an individual athlete, Russell is much more athletic.   On a shit team, Russell would be a great floor raiser. He can carry a shit team to the playoffs.  On a championship contender, Russell might be more of a detriment.   Media personality: both got haters   who’s got more Stans? I think Westbrook got more stans. You got guys that stand by him, and people who don’t like his style.  Irving’s individual skill level is unquestionable, but so is his weird “woke” personality. Don’t see many Irving stans.   Conclusion: depends on what type of team you have (shit team trying to make playoffs vs contender team playing for the ring)."
Please stop showing such disrespect on Russell Westbrook Day.
I’m assuming that you are judging Russ by his 3 point shooting. Do we know Russ to be a shooter? Hell no! He is a slashing volume scoring playmaker at best.  But with that said he can average 30 ppg if he wants to but also he is a passer.  I watched last night Rockets games for this specific stat. Russell Westbrook had 27 potential assists in that Thunder loss. That is crazy!!!  It just sucks that his role players and partner in crime couldn’t hit crap!
OKC has won 100% of the games where Russell Westbrook got a triple double for the opposing team. So Russ triple double = OKC win still holds true.
Ayy Thunder fan  Russell Westbrook is fucking cool too
Westbrook said it best man https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28076023/russell-westbrook-patrick-beverley-guard-man .
But you have no idea what he did that led to that jump. Just asserting that it's cause Russell Westbrook is a bad teammate is bullshit with no evidence lmfao
elite athleticism doesn't automatically translate to wins the way 3 point shooting does imo  if elite athleticism was actually a determining factor in games then Russell Westbrook would have led the Thunder to a title by now lol
"Russell Westbrook or Andrew Wiggins  It’s one thing to be a complete zero on a big contract like Blake or John Wall, but I think these guys are worse because they’re such big negatives in their efficiencies. They’ve got the contracts to justify taking that many bad shots, so they’re not going to change and it’ll only get worse as they age. Makes it almost impossible for their teams to win.   I could see Wall or Griffin coming back and not being terrible. Both of those guys were All-NBA level before they last got hurt, we just don’t know how they’ll look."
Well a big reason is because harden will shoot 1-17 from the three and they let him. Another reason is that I believe Russell Westbrook is a great individual player but an awful team player. The only time I’ve seen him shine as a team player is when he would just let James harden get 50 pts. Then he passes more and doesn’t ball hog. Russ is great at doing it all on his own but for some reason cannot shine with another player. Look at like this. Think of all the great players he had in OKC and only made it to one finals appearance:   KD  Harden  Ibaka  Paul George  Carmelo  Oladipo Steven Adams   Probably not all but those are the big ones that come to mind

"James Harden, Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, Steven Adams, Alex Abrines, and Mitch McGary.  Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook, two first round picks, and two pick swaps.  This isn't a debate."
"Because it's a perfectly rational opinion.   &gt;“There is no statistical case for Russell Westbrook to make the All-Star team,” Lowe said.  This is pretty accurate. Reading reddit you might be forgiven for thinking that pts/rebs/ast/fg% related more closely to player impact than something like BPM, but the actual evidence is very clear that advanced stats are superior. And you don't need any advanced stats to make the case against Wesbtrook making the playoffs."
It’s even more painful when Russell Westbrook had a HYPER EFFICIENT 32 points on 24 shots? Yes this is hyper for Westbrook. But any other player who takes 24 shots should be able to score 32.
"Agreed, but I'm specifically talking about end of game scenarios where harden tends to defer and Russell tends to play hero ball. it's been a really bad combination this year during the 4th quarter. this game it resulted in james harden kicking it out to westbrook for the game winning 3. not ideal.  has happened multiple times this year. (remember vs clippers)?"
D'Angelo Russell Westbrook
Russ likes rebounds right? Power forward Russell Westbrook lets gooo
If we’re being honest Russell Westbrook should be MVP. But y’all not ready for that conversation
russell westbrook worked hard this game but harden and the devil worked harder :/

"A shit ton of help? Have you watched how everyone on our team not named Russell Westbrook or Ben McLemore has been playing over the past weeks? Harden is slumping hard, House is slumping to hell and back, PJ is absolutely worn out and also getting banged up from playing the 5, EG is streaky as shit and still on limited minutes. Tf is he working with here?"
"You didn't see the following paragraph discussing defensive consistency?  &gt;In previous years, Kuzma would hop, jump and skip when defending ballhandlers, making him vulnerable to crossovers and other changes of direction. It also allowed stronger opponents to dislodge him from his spot because his feet weren’t anchored to the floor. He still has lapses of happy feet but not nearly as often.  Or this clip highlighting his defense on Russell Westbrook?  Clip: https://streamable.com/094ka"
"Let me preface this by saying that the Suns are my team in the West, my first love because of Steve Nash, and I love Devin Booker. I might be trying too hard to not be a homer in this comment. Also, your comment is on-topic discussion and shouldn't be downvoted, that's lame.  Westbrook is the second option on a good team. Booker is the first option on a bad team. That immediately says a lot to me. It's also important to remember that the All-Star Game is a popularity contest and Westbrook is much more popular.  Also, Westbrook's numbers are more impressive if you can look past his percentages right now, which I feel like I can. He averages twice more steals and rebounds than Booker, all the while putting up similar offensive numbers. He's also on a new team which gives some leeway to his slow start. He's played better recently. He's averaged 30-7-8 in January with 2 steals per game and a much better 51% from the field. Russell is also being forced to shoot more threes than he's comfortable with because of how Houston's system works. Give it time.  I know Reddit loves advanced metrics but the general public doesn't care about them, and that's where Devin's strengths are. Considering everything, Westbrook is the All-Star lock over Booker."
Whats the stats for Russell Westbrook and OKC?
Russell Westbrook
"Look for any post with ""Russell Westbrook"" in the title and grab some popcorn"
Russell Westbrook and Moses Malone  &amp;nbsp;  lol
"Rudy Gobert single-handedly shit down Russell Westbrook.  He is merciless, yet he was forced to stop attacking the basket in that series two years ago"
"It's hilarious to me that Rocket fans are actually rooting for D'Antoni and Morey to get fired. I think once that happens it's just a matter of time before Harden demands a trade and Houston will be left to pick up the pieces with an old team, devoid of draft capital, that's now banking on Russell Westbrook aging gracefully."
Mike D’Antoni needs to do a better job of making the offense fit for him in my opinion. I think it’s a lot easier for a coach to make adjustments than it is for Russell Westbrook to start shooting 10% points higher. He has fucked up knees which is going to fuck up the kinetic chain of his jump shot/he isn’t gonna be able to get the shooting reps in the summer.
"Russell Westbrook damn near. Dude is a good player, but to me he’s been placed in a tier that should be reserved for players who can lead their team to a ring."
Russell Westbrook 6MOTY would be a way to add depth.
" Russell Westbrook: “ Morey trick y’all, man, like he knows basketball. He just zitting around, doing nothing.”"
"1) Houston didn't give him that contract.  2) I believe that there are 5 supermax contracts in the NBA. John Wall who is averaging 0 ppg this year which severely weighs down the average. Steph Curry who has been injured all season. Harden who is leading the league in scoring. Damian Lillard whose team is 11th in the West and Russell Westbrook. It's possible with John Wall weighing down the scoring average and Curry not playing enough games, his scoring volume is above average (or average) for a supermax player.  3) Out of all the supermaxes, he probably has the 3rd best contract behind Harden and Curry. Wall is injured and who knows what he comes back to be. Lillard can't drag a team to the playoffs and at the very least, we have seen that Russ has that capability."
"or something like ""Russell Westbrook is okay with losing"""
... you said it not me. Steve Kerr was all self-righteous about tanking ruining the league prior to this season but there are many other subtle ways to do it and this is one of them... I guess it's easy to criticize when it doesn't apply to you. Russell Westbrook broke his hand on the exact same day as Curry 5 years apart (October 30th 2014) and had surgery and was back suited up November 28th.
First team = Luka Doncic and James Harden   Second Team = Damian Lillard and Trae Young   Third Team = Devon Booker and Russell Westbrook
"&gt;Kuzma said that Rondo pulled him to the side at halftime and asked him if he could guard Russell Westbrook in the second half, which led to him stepping up to the challenge.   https://twitter.com/hmfaigen/status/1218756789660860417?s=20"

dantoni is one of their best assets  imagine trading chris paul for russell westbrook AND you gave them picks  lol
Russell Westbrook approves
"In my personal opinion this is who I would choose for the West.      \#1. LeBron  \#2. AD    \#3. Jokic    \#4. Kawhi  \#5. Mitchell  \#6. Gobert  \#7. Doncic    \#8. Harden        \#9. Paul  \#10. Lillard    \#11. Booker  \#12. Ingram.      I have KAT (15+ missed games), PG13 (15+ missed games) and Russell Westbrook (Career low efficiency) missing out."
"Bro, Alex Caruso has more votes than Russell Westbrook and Donovan Mitchell lol. Pls get out of here with trying to even slightly, in any way implying that the NBA fan vote is anything other than complete poop.   And if you want to talk about just frontcourt, KP and Melo have more votes than Gobert or even KAT (since you want to talk about flashy ppl) so again, pls do not bring up all star vote like it is any good.  Edit: based on the comment below, u/14ewest is unable to read."
Effort is the one thing you can never knock Russell Westbrook on.
&gt;Russell Westbrook   &gt;0-0 3pm  You love to see it
Your flair says [HOU] Russell Westbrook and you're gonna pretend that OKC didn't trade him because the Thunder lost in 5 to a Blazers squad many thought wasn't going to win that series. Aight.
"Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double in 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Make an easy Google search before trying to correct me."
"I love Russell Westbrook. There, Thunder fans, I said it. are you happy now"
"Russell ""abuse them like they should be abused"" Westbrook"
This logic is why the Fultz trade made sense at the time.  Had OKC not finally been forced to give up on the Russell Westbrook era we'd be getting a sweet early 20's pick for a kid who threw a hissy fit when he got benched for being outplayed by TJ McConnell and refused to come back to the team.
I'm just here to declare my love for Russell Westbrook
Give me a franchise with Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant and I could make a contender too
"Doncic is well suited to the current NBA style of offense.  He would have been excellent in previous eras too because he is smart and skilled. But today with the Lebron, Russell Westbrook and Harden style system of giving your main star the ball to go one on one with 3pt shooters spreading the floor... The advantages are great for the ball handler slespecially if he can play make and also shoot.  Ayton was the Suns pick because the GM and coach at the time envisioned Booker to be the Harden of the Suns. We watched it all season long where the offense went through hjm. Sadly he's just not the creative play maker the greats are or were. Case in point with Rubio making a greater impact being the floor general.   Ayton is going to be the Suns center for the next decade and anchor the team... Assuming Booker is also there... The Suns made the safest and logical pick...."
Curry is out one year and all of a sudden hes russell westbrook lol
I didn’t compare him to Russell at all dumbfuck. And you’re really tryna act like melo and white side can help out lillard. No no they can’t. Now take off that fucking flair because you ain’t no blazers fan you a Westbrook dickrider.
"&gt; Dallas's elite bench has a lot to do with that figure  Lakers, Bucks, and Clippers all have top 4 benches and Kawhi, PG, Lebron, Giannis, and Anthony Davis all have great on/off stats.  &gt;Luka's box +/-   I am really not a fan of box office based stats. For example Luka leads the league in uncontested rebound % (Russel Westbrook style) and gets way more credit for that then he deserves.   &gt; he's completely turned Dallas around  Luka actually had a negative on/off number for a good chunk of the year and the Mavericks were still winning. The games Luka missed the Mavericks looked real good. Luka is getting credit for their deep team and elite Bench. Monta Ellis on steroids with Russell Westbrook style rebounding.   &gt;you're trying to convince people that dwight powell and THJ are carrying the team  I don't think they are carrying the team but I think if Luka wasn't on the team, they would have been a team like the Nets or Clippers of last where where they had a winning record and made the playoffs around the 8th seed with no stars but a team of very good role players and an elite head coach. Luka boosted them from an 8th seed in the playoff caliber team to a 6th seed caliber team.   I just value 3 and D in perimeter players too much to put Luka close to the top 20."
&gt;strong negative opinions about Russell Westbrook  I fail to see the problem here
What do you think of being dubbed the next Russell Westbrook?   The next Russell Westbrook? I’m the one and only Ja Morant.
"holy shit russell westbrook, who will go down as top 100-50 in virtually every nba stat, is not a good player.   fucking mvp russell westbrook. finals, wcf 4 out of 5 years, just a scrub.   holy shit i'm salty af about this."
he also has working eyeballs. That explains his strong negative opinions about Russell Westbrook.
"About Cowherd being a Portland beat writer, that explains his strong negative opinions about Russell Westbrook"
"Curry, Kyrie, Dame, Luka, Westbrook, CP3, Lowry, D'Angelo Russell, Trae young, dragic, bledsoe, cp3, kemba  Not in order"
&gt; Just wondering if Luka is getting the Russell Westbrook treatment  if you thing Russ is grabbing DRB to statpad then you know nothing about basketball
"Man, if that happened - the plethora of stars to run through OKC would be CRAZY.   Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Victor Oladipo (afterwards), Paul George, Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous Alexander (soon to be), and then Bradley Beal?   Plus Ibaka who was an all defensive team player and I remember people arguing he should've been an all-star while in OKC, crazy to see. Even without Beal that's still a crazy amount of talent that played there at one point."

"thats the problem. also, again, part of that personnel (russell westbrook) didnt play and he is large part of the system"
"I get the fan perspective a little bit. Kawhi and the clippers didn't do a great job of clarifying his injury (the nba had to step in and do that)  The casual fan. Anyway.  There are even pundits that follow the NBA that don't know the work he has to put in which is odd to me lol.   Charles Barkley a week ago says he like Russ Westbrook because he doesn't load manage, he brings it every night   Russell Westbrook hasn't played in any back to backs this season due to an off season knee scope.  Porzingis was the guy coming off ACL surgery who didn't load manage and now he's been missing games due knee soreness   Maybe it's just me, but if you got any type of knee issue, maybe you should load manage. It doesn't have to be as strict as Kawhi but a 7' guy coming off ACL surgery shouldn't be playing back to backs until maybe back end of the season.   And I doubt Westbrook is putting the behind the scenes work of load management that kawhi is. Russ is just resting(and that's ok. )"

2016-17 Russell Westbrook is the definition of a floor raiser.  2015-16 Kyrie Irving is the definition of a ceiling raiser.
"A floor raiser is someone with the ability to make a bad team decent to good. Think Russell Westbrook during his MVP season, that team had no business being as good as it was.  A ceiling raiser is someone who makes a good team great. Draymond is one of those types of guys who takes a team that is already really good and puts it over the top"
"They’re only 14-2 when he scores 40 because his good games are good and his bad games are bad, it’s either 17-31 with 54 points or 7-29 with 19 points, there’s like no in between. He’s either the 🐐 or he’s the Westbrick version of Russell Westbrook"

"AD is not ranked higher in PIPM...Maybe you need to refresh your page lol. Also, I guess let me rephrase. Every +/- advanced stat has Tatum above AD. Like I said, AD is only higher in RAPTOR because of the box score component.

"Here is what I found:  [Zach Lowe criticizes Russell Westbrook: wouldn't give up a single asset for Russ trade, says Russ never and won't ever attract stars, says he refused to change despite OKC trying to improve the offense. Would only trade Russ straight-up for a player of Luke Kennard's caliber](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cb8fta/zach_lowe_criticizes_russell_westbrook_wouldnt/)  &gt; ZACH LOWE: My somewhat lukewarm take on Russ is: **I wouldn't trade a single asset for him. I wouldn't put Justice Winslow, I wouldn't put Bam in the deal. The guy I was talking to looked at me like I had 2 heads**. Bam is on a rookie deal, Justice is on a $13 mil a year contract. I wouldn't trade a first rond pick for him. Unless I was in an unique situation where I needed an All-Star point guard to win the championship , and i dont see any teams in that situation. I wouldn't trade a single asset for him.  &gt; I would probably only trade Luke Kennard if that was the borderline asset I had to give up.  They looked at you like you had two heads because you're a fucking moron, Zach."
Are you being serious rn? Why tf would the Pistons trade Luke Kennard for Russell Westbrook??? Do you know how contracts work? What would they do with a max contract Westbrook
Keep in mind both KAT and Trae and Jokic are the #1 option on their teams. Russ got one season of being the #1 option after KD left and averaged 32/10/10 while leading the thunder to the 6th seed and winning an MVP. Put Russ on either of their teams and he's doing it again.   Russell Westbrook is a better all around player than any of those 3 guys.
He has benefited the most since the Covington trade and [I love how hes playing right now](https://www.buzzsprout.com/794936/2801851). They double Harden and he gets to go one on one and get to the rim. No big guy clogging up the rim for him either. Who needs a Center when your 6'4 guard leads the league in [points in the paint](https://www.instagram.com/p/B82r7YrhJ12/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) since Jan. 1st.

"So many posters think things like this matter, or perhaps worse, know it doesn't matter but make posts like this to get upvotes for generating cheap heat. Gobert doesn't rebound in a vacuum. He boxes out at least one guy every play where he isn't the primary. He's a far better rebounder than most other 10 per game guys because his often matter and he isn't soloing the defensive rebounding duties to buff his fantasy stats like DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, or Russell Westbrook in years past. His skill set is a mismatch against the Rockets because he gets put on a perimeter guy and has poor closing and dropping speed. Going after his rebounding, though? God, so many people following the league through fantasy stats and highlights and maybe some ballwatching in between shooting off flamin' hot Tweetos. Hold on, let me just shake my fist at some kids making noise on my lawn. ...Okay, back. Anyway, Earl Manigault could snatch a dollar off the top of the backboard and leave 10 cents change."

"Russell Westbrook is shooting a higher field goal percentage from mid-range this season than Paul George, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, LeBron James, Joel Embiid, Pascal Siakam, Jayson Tatum, Lou Williams, etc.  Russ - 41.2% on 5.1 FGAs  PG - 36.6% on 3.6 FGAs  AD - 36.5% on 4.2 FGAs  Jimmy - 30.7% on 3.0 FGAs  Lebron - 34.8% on 3.2 FGAs  Tatum - 37.9% on 3.2 FGAs  Embiid - 40.1% on 4.9 FGAs  Siakam - 31.5% on 2.9 FGAs  Lou - 38.4% on 3.8 FGAs"
i want to passionately kiss russell westbrook
"Russell ""gypsy king"" westbrook"
"&gt;it is mathematically the worst shot in basketball  Generally. And generally is where analytics works best. In specific cases, it falls apart. Damian Lillard is not Russell Westbrook, despite them playing the same position and being about the same height. You don't want Westbrook taking that 3, and you don't want Lillard seeking out the midrange. And yet they drive more than most PGs. It's almost as though Westbrook's midrange and Lillard's 3s give them room to drive to the basket - which is the most efficient field goal.  Analytics should inform your decisions but not dictate them. Use them to steer Westbrook away from 3s but don't take it so far as to say he can only shoot in the paint. ""Inefficient"" isn't a bad word."

Russell Westbrook improve a lot 200% better than last season
I fucking love Russell Westbrook.
Who needs a center when you have Russell Westbrook

Je m'appelle Russell Westbrook...mother fucker!
"Unless they play us, suddenly Leonard and Williams are Russell Westbrook."
Or a Russell Westbrook
Russ can dominate because of the attention Harden requires. Just like the Warriors were still Currys Team when KD joined. Everybody on that Warriors squad feasted off Steph's gravity. The only difference is that Brodie isn't a player of KD's calibre. I love Russell and will defend him as one of the all-time great players any day of the week but this is still very much Harden's Team and Harden does deserve credit for allowing Westbrook to play his game and reach his HoF level production and impact again. Still when it comes to asking who's better and more important the answer is easily Harden.
"Russell Westbrook and the 76ers isn't a rivalry, it's an absolute beatdown. He lost to the Sixers in his first game against them and his last OKC game against them, winning 19 in between. Also Joel Embiid has never won a game against Russ."
"That’s such a stretch.  Players get votes because voters have to vote for 5 guys, not 1.  Last year Rudy gobert and Russell Westbrook got points... at no point did anyone ever have a conversation about those guys being the most valuable player.  Being in discussion for 5th places votes isn’t the same discussion as mvp."
"&gt; Y’all remember when KD shot like 57% TS in OKC and it magically goes up to 65% with GSW  yes, stephen curry is a better shooter than andre roberson and russell westbrook  shocking revelation  &gt;Y’all remember when KD got a wide open dunk in transition cause the Cavs defenders went to guard Steph in transition  oh wow a ONE PLAY sample size lmfaoooooooooo"
"&gt;look at kd shooting splits in that last playoff run with okc  i think people dont realize how bad the spacing was on that okc team  durant was 8-14 (57.1%) on wide open threes in the 2016 playoffs. the rest of the team was 67-186 (36.0%) on wide open threes. they got so many open looks and didnt hit shit. meanwhile durant barely got any open looks at all, which put him in a difficult situation because his teammates were open but .. again.. didnt hit shit.  he didnt need to have steph to play better. he needed to not have awful shooters like andre roberson and russell westbrook lol"
"I see where you're linking from, but still not true for the month of January. It was true at a single point in time in the middle of January when that post was made.    That poster picked an incredibly small sample size in the middle of January and called it a day. If anything it really justifies how important sample size is and shows how easy it is to distort.   You could just as easily say Russell Westbrook has been HORRIFICALLY BAD  and one of the worst shooters at midrange since February - as he's shooting 34.6% on midranges in the month.   There's a reason why we look at large samples.    https://stats.nba.com/players/shooting/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*&amp;DateFrom=01%2F01%2F2020&amp;DateTo=01%2F31%2F2020&amp;sort=Mid-Range%20FGA&amp;dir=1&amp;PerMode=Totals  https://stats.nba.com/players/shooting/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*&amp;DateFrom=02%2F01%2F2020&amp;DateTo=02%2F21%2F2020&amp;sort=Mid-Range%20FGA&amp;dir=1&amp;PerMode=Totals"
"CP3 is leading the league among players with &gt; 1 mid-range FGA per game. Middleton is #5, behind Yogi Ferrell, Kevin Love, and Seth Curry. McCollum sneaks in at #25. Russell is not even in the top 75.   If you want only people who shoot much more frequently (CP3 is at 3.7, Russ is at 5.1) we can do that. Just looking at &gt;3.5 mid-range FGA per game, Westbrook is the 7th-worst, or 17th best, out of 23.   He is not a mid-range maestro. He's closer to the worst shooters than he is to the best shooters."
"Alright I’ll respond to him through you, just woke up for the day so I just saw this, but thanks for the insinuation that I’m avoiding responding to it.   Firstly u/kalefonia : you continue to read into things that I am just clearly not saying. In no way did I say Klay Thompson is a role player. I fact in my original comment I clearly labeled him a star player so I don’t know why you try and belittle me for calling him such when I clearly didn’t. My comment about role players was in response to your only refute of “he’s 3-12 in the playoffs recently, can’t win, Klay has 3 championships”. If you are calling Klay a better player for having three championships it’s just coming from the wrong place, which is why I mentioned role players. Is Patrick Mccaw as good as Klay because he has a personal three peat? He also has lots more playoff success than Russ, and equivalent to Klay, but he is a role player. That is what I was saying, you can’t look at team accolades, especially the warriors team accolades when it comes to evaluating a player.   On the same vein I didn’t allude to what conclusions I drew from the analysis about Klay being a primary option either way, the fact that it was a question that it could go either way is my point. It seems like you think that I am trying to detract from Klay as a player, but I’m really not. I don’t have much bias either way. Both Russ and Klay play for teams I don’t care for much, and neither have a special place in my heart. I’m simply just stating my opinion, of which in versus sure of, that Russell Westbrook, league MVP, is a better player than Klay Thompson, whether you like his play style or chances of winning a title or not.    Now again, yea we know Westbrook is a bad shooter, historically bad as you said. Yes on the opposite side of the spectrum is Klay, a historically good shooter. There is no argument to be made for that, and I’ve clearly stated that time and time again. But reiterating klays skillset as an amazing shooter and defender over and over and over doesn’t constitute as a response to the reasons I listed to as why Westbrook is a better player. Westbrook is a superstar level player that dominates many facets of the game and creates so many opportunities for himself of his teammates through that wide variety of skills matched with his intensity and athleticism.  Klay is a scorching shooter, and when he goes off he goes off, and that’s not being put into question, but how many games is he in charge of scoring, passing, pacing, penetrating, and running the transition all at once? He’s just simply not, even as a primary option that series he is a shooter through and through,creating some opportunities for himself and getting open to get his shots. That’s an important skillet without a doubt, especially when a player is that good at shooting, but it doesn’t counteract all those other responsibilities that Westbrook carries game in and game out and executed on.   For discussions sake would you say that if Westbrook continues his current streak of play into the post season, relying on his amazing skillset that I mentioned, would you perceive him as better than Klay then?"
"He does it a lot, relative to other NBA players.  https://youtu.be/jMRtRweaLZw  Just search on YouTube for ""Russell Westbrook fights"" and let autofill pick the other player. Another notable one was with WCS."

Russell Westbrook never grew out of his terrible 2s
"Firstly, I never mentioned regular season stats, just the tools he has in his skillet that make him such an incredible player.   I really just don’t know what to say man. Obviously you aren’t going to try and be objective about this, which is fine because it’s okay to Stan your own players, but I don’t really see the validity in what you’re saying. The rockets have done an amazing job the last two months in terms of Russ’ game plan , where he has been on a monsterous tear without shooting much and playing to his other strengths that I listed. And the result of doing that has been overwhelmingly clear so I’m not gonna waste time outlining just how much of an animals he’s been this year. Back to the postseason vs regular season arguments all I can say again is that Klay being on teams with steph and KD, and being a third to fourth option every postseason run on amazing teams doesn’t make him better at basketball. There has been loads of good analysis and discussion on Klay’s ability to be a primary option or lead a team without transcendent players to make up for his specified skill set. I’m not trying to knock how good of a player he is, as I said he is an all time great shooter, and strong at defense, but he’s not Russell Westbrook, a superstar player that quite obviously has a much wider and deeper skillet, whether you believe his play style is conducive to the postseason or not. If rings and playoff wins are your only criteria to being better than russ I can find a list of many many role players with lots of wins that are quite obviously not players of his caliber.    Also calling russ a terrible defender is a stretch. He has lulls for sure in his attention, and tends to go for risky steal attempts or poke outs that end with fouls or a disadvantage in positioning, but he also has the ability to punish and capitalize fatally when he gets the 50/50 play. His athleticism and speed make it possible to create chances like that defensively, and although he might not be disciplined I wouldn’t call him terrible by any means."
/r/NBA: league is so soft.   Also /R/NBA: Russell Westbrook is a bonafide THUG on the court
Russell Westbrook hates puppies
"&gt;  Everything else Russell Westbrook does better by a large margin  You couldn't me more wrong.  Russ is a terrible shooter -a historically bad shooter- the kind of shooting that no team can ever overcome,  terrible defender, terrible off-ball movement.    Grabbing empty rebounds doesn't win you playoff games.  There's a reason Russ is 4-12 in the playoffs last 3 years...because he has no clue how to play team basketball.     Keep hyping up empty regular season stats tho as if they mean something."
"Klay is a very good player (an all time shooter clearly) on an all time great dynastic team. His team having success and him playing good on such a team with steph and KD, do not make him better as an INDIVIDUAL basketball player than Russell Westbrook, it just doesn’t. Better shooter by a huge margin definitely, better defender most of the time, obviously incredible spacer. Everything else Russell Westbrook does better by a large margin, whether it be facilitating/leading an offense, finishing, transition, creating passing lanes/pulling defenders inward to space the floors, rebounding, and so on. Klay Thompson is a star incredible at what he does with his specific skill set 3 and D all day, but Westbrook is a superstar in the league with a much wider set of uses and skills that are quite clearly superior to a very straightforward skill set player like Klay."
lmfao this guys mind really went to if Russell Westbrook is gentle enough during sex
Pop quiz: is there anything Russell Westbrook likes very much
Lol these fucking Warriors clowns really trying to find a way to explain how Klay is a better basketball player than Russell fucking Westbrook.

OOTL...why would Rockets legend Russell Westbrook hate these young and scrappy and last place Warriors?

"I love Russell Westbrook but I think Chris Paul is the better basketball player. You had to get out of that contract though, especially with the infighting happening, he was just too expensive to keep if he was bringing the morale down"
I have never said anything bad about Russell Westbrook in my life.
I can go for another Draymond game.  He loves sticking it to the Rockets and Russell Westbrook.  He doesn't get up for too many games this year.
Rockets finish the league as the 4th seed but still end up winning the ring.  Pelicans secure the 8th seed and Zion wins ROTY  Raptors make the finals by knocking out the Bucks again in the conference finals.  Nuggets and the Heat get knocked out in the 1st round of the playoffs.  Russell Westbrook will finish this season with the 2nd best TS% of his career.  Embiid doesn't make an All-NBA team.  Portland finish as the tenth seed.
Gotta be Westbrook. D'lo did a sign and trade plus nobody calls him Russell.
"No. There's not.  Kobe, Kevin Durant, Allen Iverson, Steph Curry, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Kareem, Wilt, Shaq, Charles Barkley, Magic, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie, Jerry West, Bob Pettit, James Worthy, Wade, Elgin Baylor, George Mikan, Dr. J, Isiah Thomas, John Havlicek, Rick Barry, Cliff Hagan."
"Raptors have always had at least above average defenders over the years, even at the back up position (Terence Davis II, FVV, Delon Wright, Corey Joseph) but Ish just seems to succeed in attacking all of our schemes.   We sag back on pick and rolls to lure opponents in to mid rangers and floaters, but he nails them or beats the big to the basket anyway. He also excels when we switch on picks. Then off the ball he attacks well when the defense is scrambling to rotate with his speed and shooting. But then if you put all that together you'd think he's Russell Westbrook with three point shooting so like what the hell, who is this guy, it doesn't make sense.  Maybe we just don't pay attention when he doesn't play well."
"1000 smart ass replies later, I still would like to know which Russell as well   Sorry I don't keep up with any Russell other than DLo or Westbrook"
"&gt; Repeat after me: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook (twice), Chris Paul  He left OKC at 22 years old and the franchise hasn't been back to a Finals since. Chris Paul is still past his prime, and basically missed the last two games of the WCF due to injury. Again, you are going to blame Harden for CP3 getting injured? Westbrook is also past his prime. lol"
"Repeat after me: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook (twice), Chris Paul"
"&gt; OKC has had Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Paul George, Victor Oladipo, and Domantas Sabonis   imagine having all these stars playing for your team and you still havent won 1 championship"

I mean he plays hero ball sometimes but you're overstating it...  The problem was that Russell Westbrook thought he was Michael Jordan.
"OKC has had Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Paul George, Victor Oladipo,  and Domantas Sabonis. walk through those doors. they’ve never had a player speak bad about the organization or the FO.

Russell Westbrook is running the strings. It’s his league we just get to watch him
Russell as in Westbrook or Deangelo? How would Westbrook know?
"I'm sorry, next time I'll just go:  PG: Chris Paul SG: James Harden SF: Russell Westbrook PF: Luka Doncic C: Pascal Siakam  Maybe those top 20 players should work better."
Russell Westbrook
"KD has had: Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, James Harden, Steve Adams, Andre Roberson  KD is the greatest scorer of all-time but his play style doesn't elevate his team mates.  Steph Curry involves his teammates much more effectively. Rather than waving everyone off to ISO one-on-one  and marginalizing everyone to spot up shooters, Steph will give up possession of the ball often times and run off-ball, leveraging his ""gravity"" to pull defenders away and enabling his team mates to participate in the offense with space. He even sets screens.  That's the difference that people don't understand, and that's what shows up in advanced metrics that highlight Steph as being significantly more impactful than KD.  Would Klay, Dray, Harrison Barnes &amp; Andre be as effective as they were playing in KD's Thunder teams? Where their roles on offense would be to stand on the wings and watch KD and Russell Westbrook take turns isolating?"
Westbrook is all bark no bite.    Patrick would make Russell cry
"I would go with this line up.

Russell Westbrook looks like someone tried to draw Raphael from memory

"I was thinking about this the other day - if you had to replace the TNT desk with active players, what combination of players would match their experience level?  - Shaq is a 4x champion, MVP, 15x All-Star  - Chuck is a MVP, 11x All-Star  - Kenny is a 2x champion  So all together the TNT desk consists of 6 rings, 2 MVPs, and 26 All-Star appearances. Every analyst has at least one MVP *or* at least two rings, and **they have never been teammates**. They have also played a career minimum of 22,213 minutes.  A combination that meets these quotas:  - LeBron James (4x MVP, 3x Champion, 16x All-Star)  - Steph Curry (2x MVP, 3x Champion, 6x All-Star)  - Russell Westbrook (MVP, 9x All-Star)  The only downside is that the TNT desk has a Forward, a Guard, and a Center. Meanwhile this combination has two guards and a GM."
Russell Westbrook did not major in business at college.
"Westbrook received his first signature shoe in 2018.   [Russell Westbrook](https://www.forbes.com/profile/russell-westbrook/#3ab06cfe2f40)   And I agree with him that shoe deals should be more exclusive, and granted, at the time of his deal he has a very good argument for being a Top 5 guy (though he would probably be #5 if anything) but making these comments now when he's clearly the second best player on the fifth best team in the west would indicate that he believes there's only 3 other guys in the rest of the entire league who are deserving. One could assume those players would be Giannis, Lebron, and Kawhi. Meaning 2020 Westbrook believes he's better than players like AD, Luka, KD, Steph, etc. I thinks that's a little far fetched but you make a good point about where he's coming from, mentally. You have to believe you're the best in order to be in contention for the best. So I suppose his thoughts on the matter are NECESSARY, I just don't believe they're LOGICAL."

Russell and Westbrook 💯
"Russell Westbrook is one of the best rebounding guards ever, no question about it. And yes, he has sometimes padded his stats to make sure he gets his triple double. Both of those things can be true."
"see: Westbrook, Russell"
It's Russell Westbrook.  Conventional wisdom has soured so much on Westbrook that his elite rim gravity and incredible passing are slept on.  Westbrook's biggest problem was always jacking up shots he can't hit and on January 18th he heavily cut back on three point shooting. He went from having the most harmful three point shooting season ever (in terms of volume and accuracy) to a rare shooter. His TS% is 58% since then.  Westbrook is playing well right now and if he continues to forgo hopeless threes he will have very high impact.

Just looked at it you posted about Russell Westbrook Houston rocket 6 days ago what happened since then
Is currently a member of the OKC thunder after being traded for Russell Westbrook in the off season
Going off pure memory but here are a few games embedded in my head from 2010-2019  2011: MVP D Rose vs Heat in the regular seasons had 3 ridiculous dunks and a crazy layup over D wade and Bron  2012: Melo Easter Game  2013: LeBron dunking on Terry and hitting the go ahead game winner to extend their winning streak   2014: KD’s 51 against the Warriors. Hit 2 back to back dagger 3s  2015: Kyrie’s 55 vs the Spurs  2016: Kobe’s last game  2017: Russell Westbrook vs Nuggets to pass Oscars trip dub record  2018: LeBronto (I was at this game. Literally standing in awe of what I just saw)  2019: Is this the dagger?

Because Russell Westbrook was on the verge of averaging 75/20/14 over the last 18 games. You can only go by what you see in an argument.
So you're saying Russell Westbrook should give my grandmother a test?  I agree the American healthcare system is poor. I don't see how this is relevant to NBA players getting tested.
I'm not questioning the reality of all this. I'm questioning the fact that people like yourself are just fine with it. Would you be ok with your own grandmother being denied care so a healthy Russell Westbrook can be checked out?
That has nothing to do with these NBA players that are just trying to get through this like everyone else.  Athletes have better healthcare than 99% of the population because they put their bodies on the line. Do you complain about when Russell Westbrook gets his knee scoped for free or KD getting achilles surgery from the best surgeon within hours of a tear?  This is no different...the leauge needs to assess who has it and who doesn't so they can decide what to do.
Russell Westbrook dunked on Rudy Gobert last week and I masturbated to it live.  Am I at risk?
I had a dream last night that Russell Westbrook got traded to the Sonics..
Sidney moncrief Maurice Cheeks Gary Payton  Jason kidd I'm gonna with Russell Westbrook for the last spot because he's so dominant on the defensive glass it matters. He's also versatile enough he can switch onto bigger and smaller players.
"Man, I love Russell Westbrook."
"I understand why he frustrates people but I kind of find Wiggins sort of relatable in a weird way. He’s basically like a smart kid who got accepted to an Ivy League school but was content to just coast by on straight C’s since he knew he’d still end up with a degree anyway. Compared to Russell Westbrook who’s the lunatic hardworker that gets magna cum laude while also being the president of three different clubs and captain of the rowing team that lead them to victory despite one of the oars breaking.  Basically the NBA is so insanely competitive that it’s almost impossible to make it while having a low motor, and Wiggins is one of the rare cases that managed to power-walk his way to $150 million. He’s pretty much exactly what I’d end up as if I’d been born with Lebron’s body but with none of his other attributes and I kind of love him for it."
"Russell Westbrook has had the best crossover in the game for years and nobody gives him love for it.  Also, love to see Brodie contesting shots regardless of getting dunked on. HOU strategy doesn't care about rebounds so Brodie can focus on contests and if you get dunked on, pay it back."

"Just to keep this simple I’m gonna copy the top 25 list of playoffs players that Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe went over. First 24 are on order and 25-33 they had is the same category competing for the 25th spot, neither picked gobert for it.  (And I just added non playoff players and injured guys to the end for a player count) Or if we add in non playoff players then steph, KAT, booker, trey young and dreymond greenare in that list and if you want to take away injuries then you can add klay, KD, Irving and Blake griffin all somewhere in that list as well. Putting gobert in the top 35 is arguable, but it’s also arguable he’s outside the top 35-40, and there no chance he’s in the top 30 anyway you argue it.    1- Kawhai Leonard  2- LeBron James  3- Giannis Antetokounmpo  4- Anthony Davis  5- James Harden  6- Joel Embiid  7- Paul George  8- Damian Lillard  9- Jayson Tatum  10- Luka Doncic  11- Nikola Jokic  12- Kyle Lowry  13- Pascal Siakem  14- Bam Adebayo  15- Russell Westbrook  16- Khris Middleton  17- Jimmy Butler  18- Jaylen Brown  19- Donovan Mitchell  20- Chris Paul  21- Bradley Beal  22- Ben Simmons  23- Kemba Walker  24- Zion Williamson  25- Ja  26- Sabonis   27- Murray  28- Ingram  29- SGA  30- Brogdon  31- Oladpipo   32- Gobert  33- McCollum  34- steph   35-klay   36-dreymond   37-young  38-KD   39-Irving    40-Blake  41-booker"
"He can have my Russell Westbrook sucks argument that I was making a year back,  it's fine, I don't want credit for that one.  Take away my Trae Young bust one I made while your at it, please Skip."
"Did you think before you typed that comment? Are you really implying Westbrook took his team to the finals at 23 by himself. He was the 3rd most important player that post season run behind Durant and harden (harden dominated the Spurs in the western confrence finals) the heat even said there game plan that finals was to contain harden, let Durant get his because they weren't worried about Westbrook lol   Westbrook his last two post season runs finished with a net rating of -7.4 and -9.7!!! That's in his prime, with an all NBA team mate.   Chris Paul is way more important to winning basketball then Russell Westbrook."
Only one Russell and that's Russell fucking Westbrook
"Scouting report for Keldon was ""  Has a motor""  ""  Comparable to Russell Westbrook""."
"Charles Barkley 2x  Scottie Pippen 1x  Steve Nash...too many to remember   Tim Duncan  David Robinson  Also: Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Devon Booker, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Vince Carter, Blake Griffin, Shawn Kemp, Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway, Penny Hardaway, Tom Gugliotta, Amare Stoudamire, Shawn Marion, LMA, Brandon Roy, Grant Hill, Nick Van Exel, Eddie Jones  Edit: These are all players I’ve seen play in person. Of course I’ve seen Jordan play 100s of times but only on TV (among many other greats). My first live NBA game(s) was 1995, I saw the Lakers and Bulls vs Phoenix. Jordan was retired but came back a month later."
"Results oriented thinking is ignoring process and focusing only on outcome.  For example, say Russell Westbrook takes a logo three early in the shot clock and happens to make it.  Results oriented thinking would have you believe that was a good offensive possession even though the process was terrible - the shot you got was really low percentage.  But because the outcome was good, you’re willing to overlook the underlying process.  Results-oriented thinking has absolutely nothing to do with the conversation we’re having about John Collins. I’m curious to hear why you think it does."
"What a weird argument that is. Like just remove a starter from a team and yeah of course they find that pretty difficult to replace. Who on the Celtics roster could replace Daniel Theis right now? Who on the Rockets could replace PJ Tucker? That's not a reflection of player quality, that's a reflection of team construction.   Prior to trading for Covington, Russell Westbrook covered a lot more of what James Harden does than anyone on that team covered for Tucker but I'll tell you right now the Rockets would've rather lost. And that's the point. When thinking about the value of a player you don't just think of who else on that team could do that job, you also consider the whole league (not even mentioning what that role is, how well they do it, and how important it is)."
"&gt; I just can't comprehend someone being any noticeable amount better than LeBron in a playoff series  I'm old enough to have watched Jordan's whole career, and I can tell you that what made Jordan so good was not just his incredible athleticism and skill, but most importantly it was his will, which can be tough to really convey to people nowadays. The best I can explain it is imagine if Kawhi did what he did, but while regularly scoring 40 and 50 points in games, even in the playoffs, all while regularly getting 6-8 assists per game, and doing it all with the personality of someone like Russell Westbrook. Watching Jordan you just felt like it wasn't even a possibility that he would lose, and that it was even surprising when he was challenged.   LeBron has all the physical gifts (and more) of Jordan, and he's got better passing vision and maybe even feels the game better than Jordan did, but LeBron rarely has shown the absolute will that Jordan did virtually every game. [LeBron's Game 6 against the Celtics in 2012](https://i.imgur.com/H9nDk2Y.png) is what I'm talking about. In that game you just saw LeBron's will to dominate, but that game stands out from so many others because that's not normally what we see from LeBron. LeBron is almost surely a much nicer and more well-rounded and decent person than Jordan is/was, but it was Jordan's basically sociopathic insistence on demolishing anyone in his way that was what made him who he was."
"Harden and CP3 I could maybe give you, but Steph &gt; Harden and Klay &gt; Westbrook (and no I don’t care about ‘floor raising’, on 90% of teams Klay contributes more to winning than Russell)"
"There are enough games left to drastically change things but if the season ended today I'd have it as:  All-NBA 1st team:   F - Giannis Antetokounmpo, F - LeBron James, C - Nikola Jokic, G - James Harden, G - Luka Doncic  All-NBA 2nd team:  F - Kawhi Leonard, F - Anthony Davis, C - Joel Embiid, G - Damian Lillard, G - Russell Westbrook  All-NBA 3rd team:  F - Khris Middleton, F - Jayson Tatum, C - Rudy Gobert, G - Chris Paul, G - Trae Young"
"I'm going with a mix of athletic dominance, skill and trash talk on this one.  PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - Michael Jordan  SF - Larry Bird  PF - Karl Malone  C - Shaquille O'Neal"
Russell Westbrook will also be blamed for any of harden's shortcomings in the playoffs ala the kd and rw thunder
Jack Russell Westbrook
Bucks had the best record in the league. Seeding matters!  2010-2019 only 1 MVP winner wasn’t on a Top 2 seed in their conference. Russell Westbrook had to average the first triple double since Big O to do it.
"He's not quite strong enough to be a good defender yet but that could be said about most rookies. He has the athleticism to become a really good defender, he might need to add some muscles and learn the NBA game a bit more to reach his defensive ceiling. My only concern would be is that Russell Westbrook (who is his closest comp IMO) is poor defensively and Russell Westbrook was an excellent defender during his days at UCLA. But let's see how hard he works and how much muscle he puts on."
Russell Westbrook hes out of his cotton picking mind.
&gt; The Thunder needed to get rid of him and the Rockets were desperate to get rid of Paul.    And I’m sure a situation similar to that will occur in the offseason  &gt; You can’t build a winning team around him  Russell Westbrook has never been on a losing team in his career lol
"The Rockets are a high variance team. I think they will be dangerous in the playoffs if Dantoni makes some adjustments. The smallball lineup can be super strong but it's not meant to be spammed 48mpg as playing smallball is very demanding physically. Right now they're running the team into the ground, especially Harden and Tucker. The only player able to play highpace smallball 38mpg is Russ. If Harden and Russ had a stronger supporting cast to lower the minutes for the starting lineup I feel that this experiment could work over a whole season. Right now the Rockets need some rest though. They aren't as bad as recently and they aren't as strong like shortly after the RoCo trade either.  So I wouldn't say that smallball failed them, their rotations and minutes played did and honestly you could see it from miles away. Dantoni managed to make Harden tired last year already when they played a slower pace and had a real big man defending the rim. In my opinion, Harden Russell Tucker and one floorspacer (Rivers, Gordon it doesnt matter that much) have to be at 100% and at that point they will be very dangerous again.  In the future, they desperately need a consistent lob threat again. Throwing lobs is one of Hardens and Russ' best weapons, especially Harden needs someone to throw lobs to to score consistently in the paint. Splitting the D with a strong rollman enabled most of Harden's inside scoring as he isn't as explosive as Westbrook to get to the rim. That's also the reason why Harden is shooting even more recently. I feel part of it is being tired/load-managin on court, the other part is the Rockets lacking an important part of Harden's playmaking after the RoCo trade.   Tbf Capela was injured before but yeah they need a P'n'R Rollman in their lineup to fully unleash their potential, even while playing smallball almost exclusively. I still think their window is open, I'm not so sure about this year, though. With some small adjustments and a deeper roster they are very capable of winning a ring."
"A few years ago, there was a moment of some real hype for Schroder (at the start of 2017 there was some mild buzz of ""is he already All-Star?""), which then passed, before he was traded from Atlanta to OKC. I think he was limiting himself more than any teammate would.  Last year, I think that OKC really hoped that Schroder would lead bench lineups. It seems easier, right? But he wasn't doing too well in that role. He would shoot just around 50% in that time when he would be ""the star"" against opponent's bench. It just didn't look very well. A lot of pull-ups that he is not good enough with to play like a star. I would argue he actually fared much better as a complementary piece to Russell Westbrook and other starters.  So I would not say Westbrook was ""holding him back"". Schroder actually seems to enjoy to be ""held back"", as in - to have a less dominant role, to be assisted more, to be able to choose shots like never before. He gets better open shots, he gets better passes when he cuts inside. In a way, he's asked less on offense than he was before.  And some if it still seems to be: he's also just plain shooting and defending better than ever before."
Russell Westbrook just smiled
It’s hard for any player but spot up shooters to fit with a high usage guard with a broken jump shot.  |Player|MP|PER|TS%|3PAr|FTr|ORB%|DRB%|TRB%|AST%|STL%|BLK%|TOV%|USG%|WS|WS/48|OBPM|DBPM|BPM|VORP| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Chris Paul|2003|21.7|.609|.347|.311|1.2|15.5|8.6|33.4|2.4|0.4|13.0|23.2|8.1|.194|3.2|1.2|4.4|3.2| |Russell Westbrook|1868|21.5|.537|.170|.288|5.2|18.4|11.8|35.1|2.1|0.8|14.7|34.5|4.2|.108|2.0|-0.2|1.8|1.8|   Chris Paul has thoroughly outplayed Westbrook this year. Presti is the best GM in the league got the better player and somehow got two picks and pick swaps out of it.
Chris Paul is and always has been a better basketball player than Russell Westbrook.
"**OKC lost:**   Patrick Patterson (waived)  Eric Moreland (waived)  Jawun Evans (FA)  Raymond Felton (FA)  Markieff Morris (FA)  Brandon Clarke (trade)  Jerami Grant (trade)  Paul George (trade)  Russell Westbrook (trade)  2021 OKC 1st  2023 OKC 1st  2025 OKC 1st ____  **OKC gained:**  Mike Muscala (FA)  Luguentz Dort (FA)  Darius Bazley (trade)  Danilo Gallinari (trade)  SGA (trade)  Chris Paul (trade)  2020 DEN 1st  2021 MIA 1st  2021 HOU 1st  2022 LAC 1st  2023 LAC 1st  2023 MIA 1st  2024 LAC 1st  2024 MEM 2nd  2024 HOU 1st  2025 HOU 1st   2025 LAC 1st  2026 HOU 1st  2026 LAC 1st   ____  On paper, this was an incredible blow it up year. Dump some of your moderately successful players like Morris for salary room, gain moderately successful players like Muscala and Gallinari through trade, trade away 3 of your best players in Westbrook, Grant, and George, acquire youth in SGA and an astounding net gain of 9 1st round picks and a 2nd round pick, and saddle yourselves with a bloated and washed veteran who can maybe help your youth. Let your best defender Roberson take a year off to rehab. Take a rebuild year or two, and try to get some decent guys in the draft. Probably, finally have an excuse to fire Billy Donovan, who fans have long blamed for leaving you one piece short, constantly.  Instead, OKC's got a .625 win% this year, better than last year's .598 by a significant margin. Paul is having his best year probably since 2016 between his health and shooting efficiency, as well as a significant drop in turnovers. Noel's playing like the player he was drafted to be, and Adams isn't anything to scoff at either. Schroder has decided he wants to stick around the NBA for a long time. Gallinari has had arguably his best or second best season. This post-blow up team of nobodies, one washed up guard, an above average C, and youth has outperformed the double MVP candidate group from last year.  I'm amazed. Donovan deserves credit, CP3 deserves credit, Noel and Schroder deserve credit, but there's just no world I could have imagined this in. I'm not a Thunder fan - they killed our mascot and there's an obvious post-KD-rift rivalry - but I find myself rooting for them, just because what they've pulled off should be impossible. They ought to give hope to all the teams floundering in 4-6 seed-dom, to all the teams that need a blowup. They're incredible.  Next year, the West will get to have a (hopefully) full health Warriors/Rockets/Clippers/OKC/Jazz/Nuggets/Dallas/Pelicans/Lakers top tier that should be among the best and tightest ever, and that's discounting teams like the Booker/Ayton/Lotto pick Suns, the D'Lo/KAT/Lotto pick Wolves, the great team ball of Memphis and their many youth options, the McCollum/Lillard Blazers. Barring something weird, pretty much every team in the west next year is either likely stagnant or is fairly likely to be even better.   I love this sport. I'm so excited."

Russell Westbrook single handedly turned the triple double from a rare symbol of versatility and impact on the game in all areas to a trivial sign of clout chasing
"Cool. James Harden has Russell Westbrook, and Kawhi Leonard has Paul George, and they're 5 and 9 games behind"
"Aaron Gordon,  Zion, Russell Westbrook"
"Pft, Russell Westbrook accomplished that feat no more than 2 seasons ago."
Well obviously most fans don't know shit.  They see players like Allen Iverson and Russell Westbrook as superstars.  Bottom line is that if you swapped out LeBron for prime Michael Jordan in a season like 2018... the Cavs don't even make the Finals.  Jordan couldn't win without Pippen.
"No particular order:  Simmons, Curry, Irving, Lowry, Kemba, Westbrook, Lillard, Paul, Young, Doncic, Brogdon, Morant, Russell, Murray  Are all better point guards than Rose currently  And I’m probably forgetting guys too"
Russell Westbrook and Ben Simmons
"d-rose doesnt have the sustained excellence and list of accolades like many hall of famers but he has impacted the game culturally similar to allen iverson and to a lesser extent yao ming. you definately wouldnt put him in the same class as russell westbrook now, but d-rose along with russ were leaders of a new breed of uber athletic point guards. he may make the hall of fame one day in that regard because of how he has impacted fans and even his peers that trancend just stats and accolades. Its not like he didnt win an MVP, he has to at the very least be in the conversation."
"&gt; Fact is, Scottie leading his team to 55 wins showed that he was a legit MVP talent. Consider an ""MVP"" talent like Russell Westbrook who couldn't even crack 50 wins despite having another All-NBA talent in Paul George next to him.  That Thunder team was actually better by SRS. The 1994 Bulls had an SRS of 2.87 (11th), whereas the 2019 Thunder had an SRS of 3.56 (9th). They both had the exaxt same expected W-L (50 wins). The Bulls just got lucky with an easier schedule.   Regardless, comparing him to Westbrook has nothing to do with the fact that solely looking at Bulls going from 57 to 55 wins without looking at the any other context (Kerr/Kukoc/Longley added to the team, easier schedule, that 55 win team only played at a .500 win pace the following year without Jordan) isn't very illuminating.  &gt; Jordan without Pippen = Below .500 in 5 seasons of NBA basketball:  &gt; Pippen without Jordan 50+ wins pretty much every year for 6 seasons  Again, you are omitting literally all the context lol.  Those Jordan years include his first few seasons where he was one of the best players in the league but he had no help. Pippen never had to deal with that because when he was drafted he already had the best playerin the league on his team.  And then you include Jordan's Wizards years when he was 40+ years old and originally just suited up again to raise money for 9/11, I mean are you seriously using those seasons as evidence here? Lmao  For the Pippen years you listed, he was only the best player on the team for one of them (1994). Literally every other year he wasn't even the main guy on the team.   This might be the least informed comment I've ever seen on reddit lmao."
"However they want to be apologists for it is fine...  Fact is, Scottie leading his team to 55 wins showed that he was a legit MVP talent.  Consider an ""MVP"" talent like Russell Westbrook who couldn't even crack 50 wins despite having another All-NBA talent in Paul George next to him.  Jordan without Pippen = Below .500 in 5 seasons of NBA basketball:  * 38 wins in 1985 * 30 wins in 1986 * 40 wins in 1987 * 37 wins in 2002 * 37 wins in 2003  Pippen without Jordan 50+ wins pretty much every year for 6 seasons   * 55 wins in 1994 * 50 win pace in 1999 * 59 wins in 2000 * 50 wins in 2001 * 49 wins in 2002 * 50 wins in 2003"

"PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Russell Westbrook  SF: LeBron James  PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Giannis Antetokounmpo  Absolutely no spacing. Every player is a drive and finish/dish guy. Westbrook decides he needs to be the shooter on the team, so takes 10 3pts a game, and makes 3. Teams just pack the shit out of the lane and lets them shoot. I mean, this team would still be incredible, but it would be fairly obvious what you had to do to try stop them."
this sub goes back and forth on whether or not Russell Westbrook is a top 3 PG in the league or an overrated stat padding scrub on a daily basis
Russell Westbrook.
"I said he might. I personally don't think he would dominate at all. I think he would be a solid all star center, but I don't think he'd be in anyone's top 10 all time if he played now.  And no, it's not a straight up contradiction. Lots of guys have individual success and never get anywhere.  Would you say Russell Westbrook has ""dominated"" this era?"
Spurs vs Lakers: dominated the West in the 2000s. Shaq/Kobe vs Duncan/Robinson. Kobe/Pau/Odom vs Duncan/Parker/Ginobili. Best coaches in modern era Phil Jackson vs Gregg Popovich  Thunder vs Warriors: the obvious Kevin Durant vs Russell Westbrook rivalry. 2016 WCF was one of the best series of the decade. Steph vs Russ is always a good matchup.  Lebron vs Celtics: Lebron could never get past the Celtics from 2008-2010. Lebron vs Pierce was always a good matchup during that time. Bron makes Big Three in Miami to get past Celtics. KG/Pierce/Allen/Rondo vs Lebron/Wade/Bosh. Ray Allen dips Boston to join Lebron in Miami and wins a ring with him. Cavs vs Celtics ECF in 2017 and 2018. Young Celtics take Lebron to 7 games in 2018 but Lebron prevails.
Miami drafting Russell Westbrook in '08 is a crazy butterfly effect
Wrath- Rasheed Wallace  Pride- Russell Westbrook  Envy- Kevin Durant  Sloth- Andrew Bynum  Gluttony- Charles Barkley  Greed- Latrell Spreewell  Lust- Magic Johnson
"Trae Young  Tiny Archibald  World B. Free  Derrick Rose  LeBron James  Alex English  Isiah Thomas, Dave Bing  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Magic Johnson, LeBron James  Dwyane Wade, LeBron James  Stephen Marbury  Baron Davis  Russell Westbrook  Penny Hardaway  Damian Lillard  John Wall  Here was my honest list without checking"
"MJ, Kobe, Russell and Westbrook"
"Here’s mine in no particular order, but the first few are some “Legacy” players since I think it’s important to include the non modern day players that didn’t make the original list.  - Dominique Wilkins - Bob McAdoo - Adrian Dantley - Alex English  - Gary Payton - Jason Kidd - Kobe Bryant - Tim Duncan - Kevin Garnett - Dirk Nowitzki - Allen Iverson - LeBron James - Steve Nash - Dwayne Wade - Stephen Curry - Kevin Durant - Russell Westbrook - James Harden - Chris Paul - Kahwi Leonard - Dwight Howard - Tracy McGrady - Ray Allen - Anthony Davis - Carmelo Anthony  If the first four weren’t added (since they didn’t make the original but I think it’s whack that Dominique/McAdoo didn’t get in for 50) then I could also see some high profile names like Dennis Rodman, Yao Ming, Deron Williams, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Manu Ginobli, Kyrie Irving... I think though it’s really hard to remove any of the modern day players listed above (post-1997) when your factor in MVP’s, 1st Team All Pros/Defense, Titles, Stats...   I could definitely see Giannis getting in as the “Shaq” pick of the 75th Greatest Players list (Shaq got in the 50th Anniversary Team when many felt he did not deserve it yet as he had only been in the league 5 years at the time)."
"No guarantee I agree with these people, I'm just seeing if I could come up with 50 that you could put ahead. In no order btw.  1. Jordan  2. Lebron  3. Kareem  4. Bird  5. Magic  6. Wilt  7. Russell  8. Shaq  9. Hakeem  10. Kobe  11. Duncan  12. KG  13. Dirk  14. Wade  15. Ewing  16. Erving  17. Karl Malone  18. Moses Malone  19. Stockton  20. Nash  21. CP3  22. Curry  23.

AI  49. Kidd  50. Wilkins  Yeah, I think you gotta put Pierce up there"
"This isn't a good metric at all since that basically means Magic, Russell Westbrook, and Oscar Robertson are undoubtedly top 3 alltime, no questions asked."
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Nazr Mohammed, Serge Ibaka, Victor Oladipo, Paul George"
Teams never take good shots on the shot to get the 2 for 1 though. They take incredibly bad shots that might as well be a turnover. Russell Westbrook taking a 35 foot pull up 3 isn't a 30% look that's like a 1% look.
"You still have Westbrook leading an offense that has no continuity, because you can't really run an effective off-ball heavy offense with Russell Westbrook on the floor.    So...yup, still 0"
"In that case, why did only one ESPN writer (Ethan Strauss, based out of Oakland) have them making the finals in 2014-15 let alone winning? You're absolutely right that it was a very talented team, but are you saying that you thought that Klay Thompson was better than Russell Westbrook?"
"There have been many better players than Russell Westbrook, but there have been very few players that are more fun to watch"
"What does the line between first team and second team mean to you? If he *had* made first team, how would that change your view?  Let me put it simply in this way: of all the players that played point guard that I ever watched play against my team, these are the ones, in order, that I felt most wary about playing (with all-defensive 1st &amp; 2nd team selections):  * Magic Johnson (0) * Steph Curry (0) * John Stockton (5) * Isiah Thomas (0) * Steve Nash (0) * Allen Iverson (0, more of a tweener guard) * Chris Paul (9) * Jason Kidd (9) * Gary Payton (9) * Russell Westbrook (0) * Kyrie Irving (0) * John Wall (1) * Kevin Johnson (0) * Tim Hardaway (0)  I have Damian Lillard (0) on my team, so I've never needed to be wary of him, but I'm sure some fans are. I didn't list guys like Chauncey (2), Deron Williams (0), Action Jackson (0), Rondo (4), Mo Cheeks (5), or even Penny (0) when he played point.  Why is he third? Because he *could* score at will; he *could* create his own shot. He didn't take the shot as often as he could have, but he drove to the basket as often as any of these guys, and he always found the best chance to score. He was a nightmare to deal with. He sliced teams up on a game to game basis. Sure, a lot of these guys did, and a lot of these players were good at finding open men, but Stockton was the best at it.  [This list](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ast_pct_career.html) shows the percentage of team baskets each of these players assisted on whenever they were on the floor. If Stockton put up more buckets, his number would be lower, but he'd have more points and would probably be taken more seriously. He always found the best chance for his team to score, and he was the most efficient and selfless player I've ever seen."
"In 2006, I met Billups at a local mall when all-star weekend was in Houston. He was doing a signing and they had a rule of only one thing could be signed (They provided a free picture of him or you could bring your own item), I brought a card, then stood in line again to a get a picture to give to my cousin and he remembered me.  In 2013, when all-star weekend was in Houston again, I met several more.  Dikembe. My friend and I shouted at him from across the street and he waved at us.  Saw CP3 doing some promo thing for State Farm, and as he was leaving he walked through the middle of the crowd where I happened to be standing. He gave me a fist bump and I told him to sign with the Rockets (he was a free agent to be that summer) He just laughed at me and kept going. I still say I'm the reason he came here, although it was later than 2013.  Saw James Harden walking, he had security surrounding him pushing people out of the way, he was on his way to coach some game against Russell Westbrook.. Celeb game maybe?  Got an autograph from Jrue Holiday. It was his first ASW so he was friendly and having a good time.  LeBron and Kobe were there also but they did their events and dipped out the back immediately after.. Got to see them as they made their exit together.  Also had the chance to meet Karl Malone that night, but fuck the Jazz. I wasn't interested."
"Saw Russell Westbrook at a restaurant with his family. No one—myself included—bothered them while they ate, then they finished and left in peace."
"No player currently is as cool/iconic as iverson/ Jordan were. But list of Cool players:  Westbrook, Harden, Oubre, Russell, Lillard, Booker, Tucker"
"Jokic is better in the 90s, but with less highlights.  Lebron obviously.  AD would be worse  Kawhi would be about equal  Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook would not play point guard"
"He doesn’t scare me like a Steph Curry, Chris Paul, Dame Lillard, Kyrie Irving, or Russell Westbrook though."
"&gt; Exactly, I only mentioned points  But you also said it's not just about points.   &gt;If I can’t assume, neither can you, and your whole argument is invalid.  You assumed based on false stats LMFAO. At least I could make an educated guess that Klay would probably do alright in a game 7.  &gt;Rebounds aren’t part of defence? Stop quoting comments not directed at you to prove a point  Rebounds are a small part of defense. Russell Westbrook isn't a good defender. Neither is Andre Drummond. And I quoted a comment that was exactly directed at me.   &gt;You literally just put that flair up with a players name from the 1950’s to try and make you look like a real fan lol.

I've had this flair for years.   English played in the 80s and and was an amazing scorer. How do you not know about him lol?  &gt;At this point, this is literally just educational for you. I kinda feel bad for the people close with you having to deal with such a thick headed person  Lol half your comments are getting downvoted whereas most of mine are upvoted a lot more. I think people agree with me that you're the dense one here."

"Heavy luxury tax i would assume. I think to make it work either gasol or Ibaka had to go the other way in addition to Pascal. I don’t remember the details that were being thrown around, but it wasn’t a Celtics-Nets level fleecing.

Bruce Arthur of the Toronto Star reported the Thunder ""asked for Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and four unprotected first-round picks as a starting point for Paul George. The Raptors believed they were being used as leverage, and believed Kawhi finally, truly wanted LA. And then he left.""”"
Being an all star? Obviously Russell Westbrook is better and more valuable but asking whether or not Kyrie was good before LeBron is dumb.
"Ok but are you telling me people like 2013 PG, KD, Dwight Howard, Russell Westbrook wouldn’t do well in the 90s? Come on now. Russ in particular would score like 40 a game"
"Is there a right or wrong answer? You have Russell Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard and Steph Curry but you also have Harrison Barnes.

Sounds like a description of Russell Westbrook if I’ve ever heard one.
"Russell Westbrook isn't an MVP caliber player anymore, but true Ben Simmons isn't there himself, yet"
Russell Westbrook= Ninja Turtle; Rajon Rondo = Real Turtle
"Newly-named game-on-the-line time is the final minute of a game where a team is behind three or fewer points, or tied.  In his seven NBA regular seasons, Lillard has made 44-of-114 shots that fall in this category. That’s a 38.6 percent clip with the pressure of the world on his shoulders  Kyrie Irving: 36-of-83 (43.3 percent) [2018-19]   Chris Paul: 47-of-119 (39.5 percent) [2018-19]   Stephen Curry: 27-of-76 (35.5 percent) [2018-19]   Russell Westbrook: 51-of-182 (31.8 percent) [2018-19]   Kemba Walker: 38-of-123 (30.8 percent) [2018-19]"
"1. PER sucks, [Here's](https://youtu.be/podGzO0O7KI) a video explaining why. Essentially the reason is that PER heavily favors players who take a ton of shots, such as Russell Westbrook. More counting stats the better. I prefer PIPM, RPM, RAPTOR/DRAYMOND and RAPM  2. Passing and Creating are 2 very different things. Creation requires a player to be a good scorer but not necessarily a great passer ie. Jimmy Butler. Passing doesn't factor in scoring, it's simply your ability to make the correct reads and make an accurate pass, which Draymond is nothing short of amazing at.  3. Those are not mutually exclusive.  4. Explosive athelticism is not the only kind of athleticism. Draymond Green is very agile, super coordinated and is very fast in the open court. [Here's](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4DbiXlX115UwbUO0F2q7Nk?si=5AbpvvOuQFurvlQwxi3trw) a podcast episode where P3 project coordinator Eric Leidersorf (a Biomechanical Engineer who graduated from standford) discusses the different kinds of athleticism"
"Are you sure you watch basketball?  Lets name all the amazing passers who average between the 7-8 assist range just this year: Nikola Jokic, Ben Simmons, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. LeBron James for most of his career didn't average over 8 assists per game.  Also, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry both took the ball out of Draymonds hands a lot, and each handled creation duties a lot in case you didn't know.  All the arguments you make are borderline nonsensical. Not once have you used relevant statistics, not once have you vocalized an observation about Draymond's abilities, not once have you explained to me why you think Draymond is a bad passer or is a low IQ player. Just saying ""BuT thE TeCHnIcaL FoULs"" isn't enough. I've provided you evidence of his ability to read the court and anticipate plays before they unfold and you covered your eyes. I've given you resources from a person who's worked for NBA teams and has had years of experience as a statistician and you've just said ""he knows nothing"" without even listening to what he has to say. I've given you advanced statistics and On/Off numbers that you've ignored. I've refuted your claims with reasoning that you've also just elected to ignore. And you continue to just use counting stats as ways to tell whether or not a player is good. Hell you've chosen to go after my phrasing before actually combating some of the points I'm making.  Listen dude I don't know how you think you're winning when your talking points include: Sensationalist bits like those techs, basic box score numbers like points and assists, irrelevant points about how Draymond can't elevate a trash team to mediocre heights, and my phrasing.  Ooh I'm just getting hammered with all these cerebral points you're making. Dude you've lost hours ago, give it up, it's embarrassing to see you claw at almost random arguments that barely even relate to what I'm saying, much less refute it. I mean using technical fouls as a way to try and refute my points about Draymond's feel for the game? Come on man."
I get Russell Westbrook vibes?
"&gt;Russell Westbrook will demonstrate he was the epitome of ""good numbers on a bad team"".  This doesn't even make sense. He's always been on good teams, and he's always had good numbers. So this is like the complete opposite of what he is."
"Look up the Russell Westbrook incident, called out a fan on ESPN for making racist remarks. Fan claimed he was saying “Ice those knees” Westbrook thought he said “get on your knees” . Vivnt arena investigated and concluded that he was saying racist stuff and he’s banned for life at vivnt smart home arena"
[.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/sports/russell-westbrook-utah-fan.html)
Russell Westbrook with defensive abilities.
"Also Paul George, Russell Westbrook (in some ways), CJ McCollum, Kawhi, the Gasol brothers, Bill Russell..."
"IDK if this was sarcasm or not, but it lets the center leak out, and has historically been far more efficient offensively.  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  &gt;Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  &gt;That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  &gt;After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years.   Also FWIW, Durant used to do the same, it was an old part of their offense for a really long time, if you look at the ""uncontested"" rebounds in 2016, KD had a bunch, Russ had a bunch.  When KD left Russ just kind of got a few leftovers."
Man that's crazy how the Thunder in 3 years were never able to get out the first round with Russell Westbrook and in CP's first season they look primed to do so facing the Jazz in the 4-5 matchup.
"Responding to OPs OKC point, you know what’s worse than mishandling Harden? Drafting Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook then having the whole team moved.  I don’t care if it’s technically the same franchise."
A good amount of people viewed Russ as better than KD that year.   [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/)
Yes. Jeremy Lamb might reach 2020 Russell Westbrook status.
"Not seeing players good (or bad) points, when there is a strong majority opinion about this players capabilities.   For example: Russell Westbrook is not a great shooter and has hurt his team quite a few times with taking too many shots. (There was a thread about taking 30+ shots in a game today.[https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/gmms7s/when\_russell\_westbrook\_attempts\_30\_fgs\_in\_a\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/gmms7s/when_russell_westbrook_attempts_30_fgs_in_a_game/) )   Now some people take this absolutely viable criticism also as evidence, that Westbrook is just a losing stat chaser and additionally discredit his triple doubles as worthless without checking the facts. Thing is, that this is not just a controversial opinion, it is almost certainly a wrong one. Due to the large sample size of his triple doubles, we can with high mathematical probability make the following observation: He should pretty much always hunt for them, since his teams win an incredible \~80% of games he records one. That is an insane number, far higher than the best OKC season in history (even with Durant).   The Coach only has to tell him not to change his mindset just to scoring, but to keep on going with rebounds and passes :D"
Oklahoma City Thunder were 110-28 in regular season games where Russell Westbrook got a triple double. Actively hurt is a stretch.
Epitome of class - Karl Malone  Complete polar opposite - Russell Westbrook
"I mean it's true. At the absolute best, Demar is the tenth best guard in the west. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Devin Booker, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell are all certainly better than him."
"1. Penny Hardaway   2. Kevin Garnett   3. Shawn Kemp   4. Kyle Korver   5. Tmac   6. Allen Iverson   7. Rick Fox   8. Dennis Rodman   9. Latrell Sprewell   10. Russell Westbrook   I generally like guys that put in 100% effort such as KG, Russ, AI etc. Plus guys like Penny, Latrell, Kemp were big during my nba formative years."
"Detlef Schrempf Gary Payton Shawn Kemp That one dude we had from Texas U for a year ROTY Jay Buhner Ray Allen Lenny Wilkins Former Sonics great Coach/GM Bill Russell Squatch We drafted Russel Westbrook, look it up"
"It used to be Russell Westbrook and James Harden, but now that they're on the same team with an owner that is arguably one of the worst in the NBA, I just feel sorry for them."
"He still is by far one of the most talented players in the league. Nearly 7 foot with handles and skills like any top guard in the league, and also one of the most versatile defenders, seemed like he got much better defensively after going to Golden State.  But for leaving to the team that whooped you and your brothers asses, that- if you can't beat em join em coward mentality, and he clearly was on a mission to become a tough guy thereafter being thrown out of games, on court fights, increase in technical fouls. He was the biggest fake tough guy ever, running your mouth and getting in people's faces doesn't prove you're tough, especially someone as skinny as KD, Russell Westbrook would break him in half in a fight no question....and then most recently continuing to throw teammates under the bus like he did in Golden State,  and up and leave the way he did. In OKC he was one of my favorite players, but it seems like he has changed a lot since then and completely flip flopped personality wise into this fake tough guy.  That said, it will diminish his overall legacy and he still has yet to prove he can lead a team to the Finals and win.   He has a chance but would have to do something in Brooklyn like win 2 or 3 championships and atleast one or 2 more MVPs/DPOY to even enter the conversation for top 5 let a lone the goat convo"
"Ok imma do there whole roster  Robert Covington: Going off what Minnesota got I would say about 2 average first rounders  PJ Tucker: I might be overrating him but imo every contender needs a guy like tucker and someone who will do all the dirty work imo he gets back a first and 2 seconds  Gordon: Expiring Contract and a bad first rounder   Rivers: Good shooter on a cheap deal about 2 second rounders  Mclemore: Great shooter and is only 27 imo he’s worth a first rounder  Jeff Green: If he keeps his current stats up in 10 games (Extremely unlikely) he would be worth a first but he is not so he will most likely just get a second rounder   Daniel House: Imo might be overrating him but I think he would get back a first rounder he is a nice young shooter   Now the two big ones  Russell Westbrook: This one is interesting imo I think he is worth 2 future low level all star level players and two future first rounders something like Sabonis and Fred Vanvleet and 2 first rounders  James Harden: Current All star,future young all star and another young piece with 4 first rounders   Are these realistic packages the rockets roster would receive?"
"Looks a lot like Russell Westbrook before every game!  A lot of people clown on Westbrook for doing it, but when I saw this part of the series all I could think of was Russ. Russ danced just like this in his own world before every game and would drop triple doubles like they were nothing."
"Source from Rockets reporter and analyst for The Athletic, Alykhan Bijani- https://twitter.com/Rockets_Insider/status/1262472398667907073  Part 2 with video in the tweet https://twitter.com/Rockets_Insider/status/1262487416159469569 &gt; Tilman Fertitta and President Trump talking about James Harden and Russell Westbrook  &gt; Trump: What did you do with your basketball players that are making 25 million a year?  &gt; Fertitta: I have two of them that make 40. Russell and James.  &gt; Trump: By the way, they are good players."
"Warriors beat LeBrons team in 2015, and they didn't have 4 All Stars then.  And sure they'll be remembered for 3-1. It was one of their 5 Finals appearances. Steph Curry is gonna retire with more Finals appearances than Chris Paul, James Harden, Dwight Howard, and Russell Westbrook combined. Losing in two of those appearances isn't the best, but it's better than all but one of his contemporaries (GOAT candidate LeBron), and people will remember that."
"I think you need to limit it to one player per team, you can't miss out Russell Westbrook from okc, or Gary payton, Ray Allen from the sonics days. Likewise with a bunch of dudes from other teams"
Russell Westbrook
What did Russell Westbrook win? He's only gone one round further.
Rose is his father. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/838871-settling-the-derrick-rose-vs-russell-westbrook-debate-for-good
"Haven't seen the ESPN rankings but Pippen @ 21 is a joke.  You've got:  MJ Wilt LeBron Kobe Magic Kareem Bird Russell Hakeem Shaq Duncan Oscar Dr J Moses Malone Karl Malone David Robinson Steph Curry KD Kevin Garnett Charles.Barkley Dirk Nowitzki Dwyane Wade Jerry West   That's 23 above Pippen. With 2 MVPs before 26, I'd argue Giannis should be right up there above Pippen. Kawhi, Harden, and Westbrook all have an argument up there as well.  Pippen is top 30, but definitely closer to the back end of that list."
"I think that’s oversimplifying it though.   Look at the second options for all of those guys, not even to diminish their greatness but pretty much all of them outside of Siakam have bomb second options (and even then his team is fucking yoked).   I’d throw in guys like Jokic and Embiid even. If Jokic had an Anthony Davis or Russell Westbrook tier replacement he’d be in a much better place.   Or look at Dame. If Dame has AD as a teammate are the blazers not title contenders?"
"&gt;Oh shit dude, the cavs doubled curry?!?! Holy shit that settles it, he’s better than KD!!  lol if the other fucking team thinks Curry's the bigger offensive threat and gives him that much more defensive attention, then idk what to tell you. In '07, the Cavs were focused on stopping Tim Duncan too and doubled him in the paint constantly. This allowed Tony Parker to go off and get the FMVP.  Does that mean Tony Parker is more valuable than Tim Duncan to the Spurs? Of course not. Just that the other team is more scared of Tim Duncan  &gt;I wasn’t talking about 1v1 I’m talking about a basketball game, almost EVERYONE is giving the ball to KD if they need a bucket in a close game and that’s not even an argument, it doesn’t fucking matter who the other team decides to throw a double at.  again, if I need a bucket, I'm throwing it to Jamal Crawford over Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook and that's not even an argument. Does that make Jamal Crawford more valuable than Russell Westbrook or Chris Paul, fuck no. Just that he happens to do one thing better at offense than the other two: score in isolation. And there's WAYYYY more to basketball offense than scoring in isolation  Off ball movement, passing, shooting, setting pin downs, PnR: Steph's better than KD at all of them  &gt;Also, I meant that the defensive teams Kawhi faced during the playoffs were much better than the defensive teams curry faced, which is true. “The magic and the 6ers” you forgot the bucks who were the highest rated defensive team in the league, and Orlando post ASB was the highest rated defence in the league for that stretch as well.  yeah in the regular season. The playoffs are a completely different story  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-EPx-v1XIY&amp;t=300s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-EPx-v1XIY&amp;t=300s)  The Raptors were farrrr ahead of the pack defensively than the 6ers, Bucks, or Magic. And they box and one'd Steph. And he *still* averaged 30 on great efficiency  &gt;Kawhi had also been playing on an injury since the bucks series which very clearly affected his play. Plus, even with all those flashy numbers you put up, Steph still averaged less points than Kawhi did even though he got all the shots with KD gone.  lol your really gonna use the injury excuse when Steph dislocated his fucking finger?  and no he didn't. Kawhi averaged 28.5 steph averaged 30. Stop citing misinformation then forming your opinions based on your ignorance  &gt;Address the fact that my point is that Lebron, Kawhi, and KD are better and more complete players than steph curry is. Enough with the bullshit anecdotal stuff, tell me what EXACTLY makes Steph curry, the career 23 ppg player, SO FAR ahead of everyone in the league offensively, that even though they exceed him by LEAPS AND BOUNDS in nearly EVERY other aspect of basketball, they’re CLEARLY not as good according to you.  Steph had the higher peak, literally changed the way people play basketball, back-to-back MVPs, first unanimous MVP ever, the most efficient season ever, every shooting record ever, led a team to 73-wins, topped himself and had the most efficient season ever AGAIN, beat KD's team from being down 3-1 while KD had another MVP on his team... not to mention the dubs were like 31-1 or something when Steph played and KD didn't  Is that good enough for you?"
"Russell Westbrook for sure, his stamina is crazy good and he’s super fast"
Russell Westbrook
"&gt;I don’t give a fuck about your arbitrary  Do you actually understand what the word ""arbitrary"" means? Statistics are not arbitrary. You naming a couple of guys that the stats don't support is truly arbitrary.  &gt;All of those players were better at basketball than Russell Westbrook in 2017.  So much better that none of them came close to Westbrook's value above replacement.    &gt;All of those players were better at basketball than Russell Westbrook in 2017.  &gt;So yes, they were better than him.    Do you have dementia? Not only did you not provide evidence, you just repeated yourself and then patted yourself on the back. That's just pathetic.  &gt;You are incredibly dense and bad at watching basketball  So, you are just repeating things I say then? I get it now!! You're just a pathetic troll that is miserable with his shitty team."
"Imo there is a bunch of players that should already be in the Hall of Fame (in no particular order): - Chris Webber - Shawn Kemp - Ben Wallace - Dikembe Mutombo  - Chauncey Billups - Tim Hardaway  - Mark Price - Kevin Johnson - Mark Jackson  - Toni Kukoc - Shawn Marion  And among recently retired or even active players (in no particular order): - LeBron James  - Dirk Nowitzki  - Kevin Durant  - Stephen Curry  - Dwyane Wade - Tony Parker - Manu Ginobili  - Pau Gasol - Chris Paul  - James Harden - Russell Westbrook  - Dwight Howard  - Carmelo Anthony  - Vince Carter  If Mitch Richmond is a member of the Hall of Fame, then the aforementioned players must also be enshrined there."
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook being overrated? Do you even go on this sub?
"&gt; KD is clearly the best offensive player in the nba though and I think the only people that would disagree are hardcore Curry and Harden stans. You guys can talk about gravity and stretching a defence all you like but if I have the ball and I NEED a bucket, there’s no question I’m giving it to KD over Steph, and that rang true when they both played together, Kevin was the first option  Is KD the better 1v1 player ? Of course, no question. Does that mean he’s the more valuable offensive player ? Of course not. If I need a bucket, I’m picking Jamal Crawford over Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook. Does that mean Jamal Crawford’s a better offensive player than CP3 or Westbrook ? Fuck no.  Use your head. There’s a reason the Cavs would double and trap Curry and run to him first on fast breaks while letting KD get George Hill on the block whenever he wanted. Why would the Cavs [throw multiple guys](https://www.google.com/amp/s/lebronwire.usatoday.com/2018/05/29/tyronn-lue-cleveland-cavaliers-throw-multiple-guys-stephen-curry-george-hill-golden-state-warriors-nba-finals/amp/) at Steph and let KD 1v1 whenever he wanted if KD is the bigger threat ??  Lol only hardcore Curry stans think Steph is more dangerous offensively than KD, yet THEIR FUCKING OPPONENTS SAID STEPH IS MORE OF A THREAT  &gt; Also, one series doesn’t define a player, especially not one that you bricked a wide open perfect look 3 to lose the series. Kawhi just averaged 30+ across the entire playoffs, going against MUCH better defensive teams, while locking down superstars on defence and pulling down nearly 10 boards a night. We’re talking about players in totality not just how much they score.  That’s just incorrect dude. The Raptors were the best playoff defensive team since the 00’s Pistons, the Magic and the 6ers were not “MUCH better defensive teams” lmao.   Also, you’re acting like Steph averaging 30 while being the absolute center of defensive attention is an outlier. Just the series before, he averaged 37 PPG on 67% TS% in a sweep of the WCF and just the series before that, he scored 33 in the 2nd half and closed out the Rockets at Houston w/o KD  Kawhi isn’t more of an offensive threat than Steph, even in that 2019 finals series where Kawhi was facing mostly single coverage and Steph was box and one’d, Steph still outplayed Kawhi offensively, i really don’t know how you could be arguing this  &gt; his size doesn’t allow him to do certain things DOES separate him from the very top guys like Bron, KD, and Kawhi.  We all know what you’re point is, we’re trying to explain to you why your point is wrong but you don’t seem to get it"
"While I agree with you on principle I really hate these takes. Because it makes players like Klay feel like they need to play like a 1st option when the NBA is a team sport. I would argue that what Klay adds to the Warriors is every bit as valuable as what Scottie brought to the Bulls. Yes. Pippen would be the better 1st option if that was the situation but that's NOT Klay's situation. He is one player on a team that plays 5 guys at a time. And with Steph on the court, Klay is exactly the player he needs to be. And he should be judged that way. No Warrior fan would trade Klay for Paul George, Russell Westbrook or Dame Lillard."
Russell Westbrook. There were previous threads on this too.
"Exactly, but my point was that Westbrook was averaging 40+ the last month or two of the season because of that new system. Having klay there and not Russell takes away."
"It's impressive, but it's still less impressive when you consider how many shots he was taking. It was impressive in a Russell westbrook 2016 way, even though westbrook was a top 2-3 creator in the league and iverson wasn't."
"it's an odd collection of talent  i'm trying to think how a team with like Russell Westbrook, Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love, some kind of crazy superwinner Dwight Howard Kevin Garnett hybird, and a worse outside shot but more athletic and better post moves Joel Embiid would fit (with i guess doug mcdermott off the bench)  no doubt Hayward and Love struggle to defend the perimeter, especially as a 2 and 3  that team is in the playoffs for sure though  and probably a contender, just depends on who they face  they're gettin lit up by golden state, but can pound it inside like no other team today"
"Wilt and Russell on defense is filthy. I think big teams like the Sixers, Bucks and Lakers would get destroyed but small ball would win. Feel bad for Westbrook though he’d average 1 ppg"
Trevor Ariza over Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook ??
"Russell Westbrook is the second greatest PG of last 10 years. Curry is obviously better, but hey it's Curry"
I wouldn’t say so. Guys that are borderline top 50 would be players like Russell Westbrook and Tracy McGrady
A.) Kyle Lowry and Bradley Beal  B.) Larry Bird   C.) Kobe Bryant  D.) Nikola Jokic and Russell Westbrook
The only teams that Russell Westbrook really had success with were when he had other stars around him. He’s a ball hog and a needless dick to the media. Never really tried on defense even though he was pretty decent when he did. Creds: I’m from OKC
"Because when you think of great spacing lineups, you think of a team with Russell Westbrook.   But since you insist, only counting years up to Kobe’s Achilles tear:  KD still leads in career PPG (27.0 vs. 25.5)  KD still leads in career points per 36 minutes (26.4 vs. 25.1)  KD still leads in career points per 100 possessions (36.8 vs. 36.1)  KD still leads in career TS% (61.3% vs. 55.5%)"
"&gt;There is a reason why Curry won a title without KD, made more finals without KD than KD did without steph, Curry has more MVPs, had a higher peak and Curry beat KD even though KD had the following seasons MVP on his team.  Because he had Klay Thompson shooting 45% from 3 and playing great defense instead of Russell Westbrook shotputting it into the front of the rim 20 times a game?"

"Jason Kidd is one of the most overrated.  He wasn't very good as a shooter and generally had trouble getting to the line.  There is no way he was taking the last shot.  Look at Stockton's shooting percentage and then look at Kidd.  He's basically Russell Westbrook, but not as good at rebounding or scoring - which is rough because rebounding is Kidd's most unique skill.  Kidd is 12-15 all time."
How do you argue Doncic over Harden?  34.4/6.4/7.4 on 62%TS and decent defense is better than 28.7/9.3/8.7 on 58%TS on mediocre defense. Harden’s also got many years of elite play to back it up. You can argue that Luka is a better passer or rebounder but Harden’s led the league in assists before and he’s sharing the ball with Russell Westbrook.
"Very well, it wasn't like he played a Russell Westbrook or James Harden number of seasons for there to be a serious shift from ""Jordan NEEDS to do this to win..."" to ""Jordan will NEVER be able to win"". It was pretty much known that the other Bulls needed to play better, there were questions of whether Jordan could lead the League in scoring and still win a Championship, and you always have your hot take artists of the day who would write newspaper columns who would say dumb stuff for Reads from time to time, but I don't believe there was an overall prevailing narrative that Jordan **COULDN'T** win. Certainly all throughout the 1991 season when the Bulls were rolling through the League for the first time in Jordan's career there was a strong sense the Bulls had a great shot to win it all."
"&gt;  PG is a second best offensive type of player.  Agreed. So is Davis. Your team isn't sniffing a championship with either as your best offensive player.   &gt; you're comparing him to AD, who, up until this year, IS THE FIRST BEST OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE PLAYER on every team he has  &gt; you won't admit if George was better than Russ  He was better. There's no debate about it. Westbrook was absolutely horrible.   &gt;  but you want to blame Russ for PG's repeated failure to reach the second round.  ... what the hell is your point? George and Davis were each the best players on their teams. The difference is that Davis' second and third options performed incredibly well, so the team advanced to the second round. George's second option sucked and his third option was your pick of washed Carmelo Anthony and a center who was totally incapable of scoring on his own or spacing the floor.   It's not that hard to follow lmao. Davis' team performed much, much better, so the team advanced. If Davis had played next to Russell ""36% from the field on 24 FGA"" Westbrook and an old Carmelo Anthony instead of Holiday and Mirotic, the Pelicans would have gotten demolished.  Paul George's playoff resume is way more impressive than Davis, who literally wasn't close to making the playoffs more often than he made them LMAO."
"No one suspected... he really didn't fall off. He always played that way. He made less shots but that's his game.   Davis' teammates are in no way better than Russell Westbrook.  How do I know this -- well what did those former teammates accomplish?   Nothing. Jrue Holiday is a nice player on a team that won't make the playoffs.  While Russ is on another finals contender. And if you replaced Jrue with Russ I think that team wins more games, Russell's relatively inefficient shooting notwithstanding."
thats's stupid. Your penalizing Steph for having such a dominant series in the WCF and closing out the Blazers so fast when an MVP and MVP-caliber players like Russell Westbrook and Paul George could only win one game against that same Blazers team.
"There is plenty of precedent for MVP players to stay in smaller markets for most of their primes. David Robinson stayed in San Antonio. Karl Malone stayed in Utah. While Philly is not a small market, it certainly isn't a glamour market with significant branding and marketing opportunities, and Iverson stayed there until he was traded (to an even smaller market) when he started to decline. Steve Nash only left Phoenix after he declined and they had no hope of competing. Dirk stayed in Dallas. KG stayed in Minny for 13 seasons. Russ signed his third contract in OKC and only asked for a trade after Paul George did.  It's actually rarer for an MVP player to leave (or force a trade) after his second contract.  Sure, I think on-court reasons in recent times make it more appealing to play in a big/glamour market because owners are more likely to go into and stay in the luxury tax and it's easier to recruit other stars to come to those teams.  However, other than lifestyle, I don't think there is any evidence that it is better for branding to be in a ""bigger"" market in the internet/social media age. And if you're famous and good enough, marketing and investment opportunities will find you no matter where you play. Melo was at the height of his popularity and likely most famous when he played in Denver. Paul George doesn't seem to have any bump in popularity playing in LA. Anthony David didn't magically morph into some super-brand once he got to the Lakers, he's mostly an after-thought and probably LESS famous in LeBron's shadow. Russell Westbrook became one of the most popular and most marketable superstars in the league in OKC. KD's image and popularity cratered when he left OKC for Golden State. And Steph's surge in popularity had nothing to do with being in The Bay, which has never been a hotbed for NBA profile, no matter how many shitty tech investments a player can attach himself to.  If Giannis leaves Milwaukee, it's not because he has a better shot at getting a cameo on Billions, it will be because he can more easily team up with the likes of Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Towns, or another young-ish superstar."
"Yeah, if you could “just play with drop coverage,” then literally every team in the league would do that. That defense may work well enough against Goran Dragic or Ricky Rubio or Russell Westbrook, but it’s not gonna work at all against fucking Steph Curry."

Russell Westbrook.

"""I think [Marcus] Smart is better than James Harden, just straight up. Most people are not going to accept that argument, but he is a ton better at flopping, like where it's not even close, and James, for him to be effective offensively, he has to have the ball ripping through the defender into his three point shot the whole time, which means that Eric Gordon and Russell [Westbrook] can't make real basketball plays... I genuinely think a lot of coaches might secretly recognize that."

"I think this is the article you might have seen (and I found it from another user):  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  &gt; Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  &gt; That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  &gt; After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years."
"https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  Yeah, I'm biased. But you can't argue away stats that show the Thunder's offense in transition was markedly better when Russ got the rebound. It basically gives him an extra step or two when he's already the fastest on the court when you forgo the outlet pass.   There were a few instances where he blatantly stat padded. I agree. But the strategy of clearing out for him to get rebounds and generate fast breaks *is not*."
"For atleast 2 or 3 years I felt that Russell Westbrook for the first 46 minutes of a game is a top 2 point guard in the league hands down... But those last 2 minutes man, gosh those last two minutes are so stressful to watch, still is an amazing player to watch and I think he's gotten better about doing that the last couple years."

"Westbrook's scouting report reads like something out of Bizarro world.  The impressive athleticism and bad shooting are pretty much the only things that are the same.  Other than that his college scouting report says he:  1.  Plays a small role in half court offense  2.  Is a limited ball handler  3.  Most of his outside shots are catch and shoot   4. Is not a great playmaker   5. Is a great defender in no small part due to his fundamentally sound defense   Also this whole quote was worth including  &gt;To Westbrooks credit, these flaws are not always very noticeable, as he is a very smart player who knows his limitations and has no problem fitting in and being just another cog in UCLAs very efficient offense. He plays within himself, rarely forcing the issue, and thus has done a very good job of not exposing his weaknesses within his teams system. - Source: http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/russell-westbrook-5062/ ©DraftExpress"

"Y’all are missing the point.  Kerr was a three-point specialist but he only shot threes within the offense when he was open.  He was not a volume shooter.  He thrives off of the triangle in Chicago and the low post game in San Antonio.  Kerr would not have survived in this current landscape, he wasn’t skilled enough to deal with the likes of Curry or Damian Lillard.  Could you imagine Steve Kerr trying to guard Russell Westbrook?!  I agree that it has changed the game.  I’m not sure how it’s bad for the game.  I would argue that the game has never been more popular.  Would you rather watch Rockets-GSW play where the final score is in 120s-130s or watch the Heat-Knicks defensive matches where they struggled to get into the upper 70s/low 80s.  Some of those classic games are really hard to watch."
"He is an all time great he is just not in the conversation of being better than Magic, Nash, Steph, Cp3, Oscar Robertson,  and this might be unpopular because people hate him but I think Russell Westbrook is better."

I swear the ringer has a weekly meeting to brainstorm “how can we shit on Russell Westbrook”
Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul are very similar in counting stats. Who’s the better passer?
True shooting being useless is a weak argument. It’s our best shot at calculating scoring efficiency as a whole. We are talking percentages over a large sample size so complaints about it being a small difference are weak as well.  Better to point out efficiency was lower in 2016 than it is in 2019 so it’s not enough to just say Young is at 59% true shooting.   The best argument here for Westbrook is that Young is putting up good numbers in relatively meaningless games while Russell led respectable offenses to the playoffs. The big numbers don’t always translate for players from bad teams to good teams.

"i watch basketball too and thats the reason im on this sub, because i like basketball, and yes he did have a quick first step but that doesnt mean he had excellent athleticism. Teams in the begging didnt now who he was so he took advantage of it. as soon as teams started to scout him he would have games where he would cost his team the ball game because he would turn the ball over, or have bad shot selections.   he also was never a very good defender because he was not athletic enough to gaurd  average point guards and especially elite ones.   easily one of the most overrated basketball players to come along in the past decade.   He is out of the league now because he was just barely hanging from it, and not that he has comeback from a minor injury, he has lost all his confidence. Confidence that any man should have in order to survive in the league. Just look at derrick rose, russell westbrook, stephen curry , paul george all still in the league from far worse injuries and are still playing at a high level. its because they never gave up and battled through their injuries to still be able to play in the league. something the lin didnt have.   this is my argument if you choose to disagree with me, thats your prerogative"

[Just as a heads up ](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29503193/mike-dantoni-says-russell-westbrook-join-rockets-monday)
Russell Westbrook will be the best player on the Rockets in the playoffs
"A nice counter to the claim that Utah’s score keeper inflated Stocktons stats, but No, it’s just how Snyder’s offense works.   It’s multiple guys who can set up off a screen and then attack the defense either going themselves, lobbing to Gobert or kicking out.   On kick outs the ball will often go around the outside as the D scrambles and leads to an open shot (lots of times with the guy who started the play as the ball handler getting a shot off from the corner) so it’s a lot less PG breaks the D down and a single kick out for a shot like, say Russell Westbrook did in OKC."
"As much excuses I wanna bring up, Russell Westbrook (my favourite player of the decade) 2 years as THE guy were a failure, yeah the fit around him was ankward, but the middle part of the Utah series and the Portland series were epic failures (to be fair I guess he wasn't even THE guy in the Portland series but still)"
But also winning any game they play!   The Russell Westbrook effect.  Last year we had the best record against .500+ teams and the best record against the top 5 seeds in the NBA  we were then quickly and swept in the first round and our franchise crumbled within weeks.  Edit: BUT IM SURE THAT WONT HAPPEN TO YOU
"But you went to two years ago where we didn’t even have Russell Westbrook, so the team was very different, so again, selective choosing.  We have won most of our matchups in the past 3 years, so we haven’t struggled in recent years and it’s not really debatable IMO.    In actuality, I agree we haven’t played them well this season. They didn’t have Nurk and we hadn’t switched to our small ball style."

"What if Russell Westbrook becomes a coach post retirement, i assume he will wear one of Walt Frazier's suits"
Aaron Rodgers... Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook throwing a ball to an opposing's team teenager fan for taunting him.
"Russell Westbrook had a near 60% TS over the last like 2 months of the season.  Basically the way he played in the win against the Bucks was the way that he was playing all the time since early January.  Starting on January 18 (when he attempted 0 threes for the first time all season), he averaged 1.9 3PA per game over the next 19 games. Prior to that, he was shooting 4.9 threes per game over the first 34 games. He seems to have kind of figured it out.  In those 19 games, he averaged 32.3 points on 58.4% TS. For comparison, the league TS% this year is 56.4%.  His career-high TS% was 55.4. When it comes to TS%, 3 percentage points is a pretty big difference. Granted that's over a full season though and not 19 games. But again it looks like it may have clicked for him finally.  EDIT: And if you want to look just at how he shot from the field, his eFG% in those 19 games was 55.0%. League eFG% this season is 52.8%, and his career high was 49.4%."
Did you know Russ Westbrook's real name is Russell Westbrook???
LeBron was also mediocre and Russell Westbrook scored 41 points. The Lakers actually beat the Rockets without AD earlier this year.  Bottom line is that if a team shoots 45% from three and you shoot 29% you'll lose. Just how the NBA goes these days. I don't think this Rockets-Lakers boogeyman exists if they lose that game.
When did Russell Westbrook join the rockets ?

Not really. If you were a perennial 8th seed in a weak conference would you give up the chance to get Emoni bates to get Russell Westbrook? Which at best gives you a 2nd round exit
That was Russell Westbrook disguised as James Harden
Your team also lost to these same Rockets. Except Giannis didn't get dad-dicked by Russell Westbrook like your alleged Defensive Player of the Year Anthony Davis did.
"As a TWolves fan, the idea of bringing Russell Westbrook to pair with Kat (even at the cost of DLo) is absurdly appealing, but I've always been a WB fan and vocal supporter."
"&gt;Russ pretty much carried the Rockets most of the night with Harden in foul trouble/not playing so well.  C'mon. You don't have to shit on Harden to praise Westbrook.  * Russell: 31/6/8 on 59% TS, 0 steals, 5 TO * Harden: 24/7/7 on 61% TS, 6 steals, 3 TO"
Russell Westbrook
"""I'm not even sure the Wolves trade Andrew Wiggins for Russell Westbrook straight up."" - Zachariah Ulysses Lowe  E: just went back to listen, 28:08 on the Lowe Post w/ Woj, July 6, 2019  Lowe’s knowledgeable obviously (hence why I listen to his podcast) but this take seemed ridiculous. Seems like he takes some of his biases too far sometimes. Like on a pod with Bill Simmons he said he’d take Ty Lawson and Rubio in a 2009 redraft over DeRozan. I know he’s not a fan of DeRozan’s or Russ’ game, and for good reason, but things like these are just too far"
Russell westbrook pushing the pace for the rockets especially when they were down had a much larger effect than the box score would tell you
I personally would like my Favourite player Russell Westbrook to secure the dub.
Russell Westbrook is clutch af
"Russell ""Giannis Antekoummpo"" Westbrook has drawn 2 fouls on the last 2 driving plays for Houston. Clutch."
DJ Wilson didn’t give up a bucket to Russell Westbrook
I have as much shot of not dying alone as Russell Westbrook has body fat.
"Russell ""Tim Duncan"" Westbrook"
Harden makes fun of Giannis’s height and lack of skill  Giannis makes fun of Harden’s manboobs and feminine tendecies  They both make fun of Russell Westbrook being built like a turtle
Rockets are different. I love Russell Westbrook.
"I mean a 6’10 Russell Westbrook is pretty fucking nasty, no disrespect there"
Giannis is basically a taller version of Russell Westbrook dude is overrated as hell
Russell Westbrook
Happy Russell Westbrook day btw
And declared every day Russell Westbrook day
"Underrated: James Harden and John Collins Overrated: Russell Westbrook, Demar DeRozan &amp; Donovan Mitchell"
Dont forget him knocking Russell Westbrook and Paul George out of the playoffs as a rookie
"My point was that your evidence is flawed. Of course I don't believe that but I have yet to get shown evidence that AD is more of a superstar than Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook etc. The 2 games you cited simply aren't enough to say someone is a superstar"
"IMO that doesn't really mean anything.. historically the best players in NBA history are forwards, aside from MJ, most of the truly all time, amazing players are forwards and centres.  Now, that's changing and the league is becoming more guard dominant, so you have way more guards that are going to get into the Hall than eras previous.  Off the top of my head, since Nash retired, you have a lot of PGs who are basically locks to get in  Tony Parker  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook  Steph Curry  Kyrie Irving  Damian Lillard  So yeah, while Lowry may not be as good as the guys you listed, he is absolutely in the same tier as the guys I named, and those dudes are all getting in the Hall eventually, so why shouldn't Lowry?"
I don’t see why not. He’s basically Russell Westbrook with a 40 inch vertical

"To Chris Paul the point gods rookie squad  I'm running with the State Farm crew and I am laudin' it!   See that's what happens when you up against the hard-eeens  We in game 7 now, somebody else gotta bungle it  Russell Westbrook, I need no introduction   After I shoot a brick I'll just throw it away again!  *saxophone interlude*  After a week of hoop, a rookie in a red jersey stands alone on a baseline  We lower our arms as he dejectedly turns and walks off the court  And just like that it's over, we tend to our injured, we count our rest days  Guards and centers alike wonder if we've won anything  Not. Yet."
Maybe but that change is not russell Westbrook
"No, this is just r/nba memers who thought CP3 was traded because he made fun of Hardens man boobs. The narrative got debunked after Morey did an interview on it.  Edit:  [https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rockets-daryl-morey-calls-trade-for-russell-westbrook-the-most-intense-of-his-career/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rockets-daryl-morey-calls-trade-for-russell-westbrook-the-most-intense-of-his-career/)      &gt;Morey also shared the interesting detail that Harden initially wanted to know if the Rockets could get the deal done to add Westbrook *without* having to give up Chris Paul in return; something that was ultimately impossible. Props to him for trying, though.    &gt;   &gt;""His mind is always \[going\] first to 'How \[can we be\] completely stacked?'"" Morey said of Harden. ""When I let him know it probably wasn't going to happen, he was good. He understood. He said, 'Hey, if there's a way to make it happen, let's do it,' but he understands that you can't just snap your fingers and make things happen in the NBA. No one is out there trying to help us. It's always a dynamic when you're trying to get the deal done.""  "
Thunder fans: Russell Westbrook
"Westbrook enters game in the third quarter with Rockets leading 75-71, Thunder outscore the Rockets 14-3.

"can everyone agree besides rockets fans that this was a fun game to watch , all I wanted was a game 7 and thanks to OKC player russell westbrook I get to have it /s .. that being said thunder would get slaughtered by the lakers."
Exactly. You have James harden on your team. No reason you should live and die by the mistakes of Russell Westbrook. No wonder KD said he couldn’t win with this cat.
[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPTzNnWh-FE)  Hilarious how Lillard has hit series winners against both the Rockets and Russell Westbrook
Welcome to the Russell Westbrook experience.
Russell Westbrook finally leading the Thunder to the 2nd round.
"Russell ""Secret Agent"" Westbrook confirmed."
Last 5 minutes. Refs were giving it to the rockets. Westbrook missed a layup and shot an air ball. Chris Paul was clutch. Russell Westbrook has a terrible turnover with less than 20 seconds left and gave it away
Russell Westbrook gets such a pass based on his reputation. Dude has some serious decision making issues.
"Tbh as much as many people, myself included, shit on C-Webb sometimes, he was 100% right when he said there was zero reason for harden to not have the ball in those situations. If you are the Houston Rockets, you are losing by 2 with 4 seconds to go, and Russell Westbrook turns it over without harden even touching it, you’re doing something wrong"
"""We had a spy on the inside, that's right   ~~HERCULES MULLIGAN~~ RUSSELL WESTBROOK!!"""
Something about watching Russell Westbrook completely fuck over a team in the last few minutes of a playoff game really bring me joy.
"“Breaking news, PJ Tucker and Russell Westbrook both suspended for conduct detrimental to team”"
I just want to thank Russell Westbrook for giving us neutral fans a game 7.
Cold take of the night: imagine if Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook switched places.
RUSSELL. WESTBROOK.
"Chris Paul has always been better than Russell Westbrook, and the Rockets swapped them *and* gave up multiple first-round picks. Major yikes."

Imagine trading Chris Paul away for Russell Westbrook lmao. Rockets could be the best team in the West right now.

Russell Westbrook is playing like he forgot what a basketball is
Russell Westbrook is the king of cringe in the playoffs.
That's the real Russell Westbrook
So wierd to think Russell Westbrook is playing against OKC in the playoffs.  Always thought of Westbrook as the face of OKC for the longest time.
Imagine walking around being Russell Westbrook.  His body is like a fuckin' Ferrari. I would never drive anywhere. Why drive? I would just take that hot sweaty tank out for a fuckin' spin around the block and not even be tired like that's something normal to do. Jogging along hanging dong and hitting the Venice beach like a fuckin' heavy metal hurricane.
“6’11 virgin of russell westbrook” lol
Are you saying its easier to guard CJ than russell fucking westbrook?  Did you watch him torch the fuck out of the lakers last game?
"If a center has to stand by a center on the 3 point line, he is not in the paint. This creates space for guards to score easily in blow bys, a la Russell Westbrook on the rockets. It is irrelevant if the center can defend the perimeter, if the center he is guarding only receives the ball when he is left open.  Centers being able to defend the perimeter has to do with pick and roll defense. If your team can switch easily, there is less chance of a pick creating space for a 3 point shot. Kind of separate issue compared to defending a 5 out offense. One is about pick and roll switching, the other is about help defense on drives and cuts."

"eh still a lot of dirty plays to do to reach Beverley.   In 2013 Pat literally injured Westbrook on purpose and after months of recovery when they faced again he tried the exact same play he used to injury Russell, in fact Russell wanted to beat his ass right after.  Hard to match this."
"Russell Westbrook also wasn't a top 5 player in 2016-2017. LeBron, Kawhi, Steph, KD, and Harden were all better."
Russell Westbrook Won MVP during LeBron James and Kevin Durant’s prime.  You can say this kind of thing about a lot of players.
"Russell Westbrook can drag a shitty team in the western conference into the playoffs, I would expect more from a top 10 player"
If you told me last year I'd be rooting for Russell Westbrook and the Dallas Mavericks come playoff time I'd ask you for your plug's phone number.  2020 the wildest
"Well that makes sense. They were in the west and Lebron was in the East. They haven’t made it to the finals since. That’s kinda like if the rockets went to the finals, “James harden and Russell westbrook haven’t had a revenge series against THE EAST since they were last in the finals.”"

There are also others that I would take over him  Here's a list in no particular order:  Lowry  FVV  Kemba  Bledsoe  Brogdon  Irving  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Westbrook  Chris Paul  SGA  Lillard  Morant  De'aron Fox  Rubio  D Russell  Steph Curry"
"In 2010 I would’ve been impressed if you were able to guess that  Derrick Rose, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Giannis would’ve been able to win MVP’s this decade. Also would’ve been impressed if you were able to guess that LeBron would go to Miami, win 2, win in Cleveland, see Golden State win 3, the Mavericks win, and the Raptors win   Teams are able to acquire super stars in 10 year time periods lol"
I hope Russell Westbrook can get healthy and stay healthy. The NBA is more exciting when he's playing at his best!
"Russell ""Double Tap"" Westbrook  A lot of Chinese fans hate Westbrook and love the Thunder. I want to see *that* thread."
And we are playing on Russell Westbrook day!
Bet Haynes' source was Russell Westbrook
"Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Isiah Thomas, John Stockton. These are all PGs any reasonable argument for Westbrook's rank all-time must acknowledge.  Assuming the best case for Russ is built on his stats and individual accolades (triple-double seasons, MVPs, all-star appearances, all-nba selections, etc):     * Jason Kidd and Isiah Thomas have more all-star appearances than Russ and 3 championships between them.    * Steve Nash has multiple MVP awards and 4 50-40-90 seasons to rival Westbrook's triple double seasons.  * and John Stockton has more all-star, more all-nba, more all-defense selections and is the all-time leader in assists by a ridiculous margin.   Russell Westbrook is the most athletic PG in history without controversy. But his stats and accolades to date don't warrant a top-5 placement ahead of the guys above, imo."
"People are stupid, they also said the Blazers, a team that was 26-39 before the bubble and struggled to win games with Dame dropping 50+, were the most dangeours 8 seed ever.  Portland didn't have wing defenders to throw at LeBron James, CJ McCollum is hurt and their bigs can't keep up with Anthony Davis. The only thing Portland had going for them was Damian Lillard and even him (as it is becoming the norm btw) didn't show up.  I don't think people understand how bad Dame is playing in this series against the Lakers and how bad he played in last year's WCF vs Golden State. Him and CJ were the strong points for Portland and both have been underwhelming.  If you think that James Harden and Russell Westbrook will struggle like this, then yeah, Houston will get obliterated, but even then Houston has guys like RoCo and PJ Tucker to throw at LeBron and is a FAR better team than Portland ever was.  Just fyi, there are plenty of teams that the Lakers would love to play, those are: Denver, Utah, Dallas, Milwaukee and Miami. Lakers will obliterate any team that depends on size and interior play, but their bad matchups are against guard heavy squads (Houston) as their perimeter defenders are lackluster af, how hard is that to understand?"
u/Russell-Westbrook-fan wants Westbrook to win
I love how rockets fans used to defend him to the point of sounding like lunatics. He injured Russell Westbrook on some bs and his first game back almost injured him again. Now the rockets have Russell and I don’t hear that chirping anymore.
The Warriors disagree https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/warriors-russell-westbrook-easy-to-defend-nba-comments-book/gjfqd6vdubua1mu9buugazeeb

Here comes Russell Westbrook!
[Story on Russell Westbrook scrimmaging Thursday in preparation for his Rockets playoff debut: https://t.co/w3movodjCW](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1299345001051193344?s=19)
Utah is heavily white-populated state and has a bit of a reputation for racism. It’s not uncommon to hear black people say they feel uncomfortable in Utah for a whole number of reasons. A few players have mentioned or alluded to the environment in Utah’s stadium being very racially hostile.  For example take this incident involving Westbrook from just last year: https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/sports/russell-westbrook-utah-fan.amp.html
"I am six months older than Russell Westbrook. It's been happening for me for a while. It's weird to ""idolize"" or ""look-up"" to a person and realize they are your age or younger. I got to meet SGA briefly before a game this season and I was a little bit nervous, which is funny because if it weren't for basketball he would just be some kid in my mind."
"He is nowhere near as agile as anyone listed:  Allen Iverson, Derrick Rose, Tony Parker, Michael Jordan, Dwyane Wade, Muggsy Bogues, John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Tim Hardaway Sr., and on and on and on and on."
"You clearly have an overinflated opinion of someone 6'9''. He is nowhere near as agile as anyone listed:  Allen Iverson, Derrick Rose, Tony Parker, Michael Jordan, Dwyane Wade, Muggsy Bogues, John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Tim Hardaway Sr., and on and on and on and on."
"Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Paul George, marshon brooks..."
"Lol seriously though, you have a Rockets flair and the Rockets had a crucial game 5 tonight with Russell Westbrook potentially returning to tip the scales back. I truly thought you would’ve realized why they weren’t playing or put two and two together with the WI shooting"
"I said ""a lot"" not everyone. There's no denying that some people like luka because hes white, and any amount of people that think that way is too many, because thats an awful way to go about things.   And I get people like him because he's ""a stud"" but do you know who else are ""studs?"" James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Zion, etc. And this sub seems to hate them passionately, while simultaneously adoring Luka unconditionally. Just something to think about there.   Im not saying you're not allowed to like luka, or if you do that its because hes white, but there are people who think that way. Not everyone, but they've certainly showed themselves in this clippers/mavs series"
Alright Russ don't sike yourself out you gotta stand up for whats right. Westbrook you trying to quit? It ain't quiting Russ I'm hurt and this is bigger than basketball - Russell to Westbrook circa 2020
Russell Westbrook saying in his mind “don’t mind the extra rest”
"The league isn't the reason the games aren't getting played, it is the players on the teams.    The league is just trying to do damage control now, they aren't the ones behind it and they aren't the ones in control, they are just asserting what control they can.  Credit should go to guys like George Hill, Fred VanVleet, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, and Chris Paul."
We don’t win this series without Russell Westbrook
It’s so funny to me that Russell Westbrook of all people is a master of the bank shot
All my homies hate Russell Westbrook.
Here comes Russell Westbrook!
Russell westbrook.
&gt; somehow lost  aka the Russell Westbrook experience
Russell westbrook
"Billy Donovan lasted longer in Oklahoma City than Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Paul George."
"In this scenario we would of gotten 12 first round picks, Sga and a year of Danillo Gallinari for Russell Westbrook.   Yes."
"Yo, imagine you’re guarding James fucking Harden. Now imagine you see Russell Westbrook posting up 18 feet from the basket with 8 seconds on the shot clock. Then, imagine doubling Westbrook and leaving James fucking Harden wide open for 3.  Seriously, what the fuck is AD doing tonight??"
A controlled Russell Westbrook is weird
"Fuck all of r/NBA, Russell Westbrook is who you wish you were, you bum ass clowns"
"I still remember getting crapped on for suggesting the heat should save their assets instead of burning them all on Russell Westbrook.  The argument, which was significantly more upvoted than mine, was that the heat had no assets, just a bunch of scrubs. Also that without another all star they’d never compete for a title. Ha ha"
Good evening to everyone except Russell westbrook haters. To them I say fuck you
If you don't love Russell Westbrook attacking the basket you don't like NBA basketball.
They have gone out in the first round 4 times in a row. Two of those times they had all stars Paul George and Russell Westbrook. The other two times they had Westbrook in an mvp season and this year with a higher seed than the Rockets.   The last time that OKC didn't go out in the first round was when they had KD.
"**Accountability, responsibility, half-court offense**  *These three things, when put into the context of an NBA game, epitomize everything Russell Westbrook doesn't stand for*"
woudl you rather have Alex Caruso or Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook the type of dude who fart in bed and then blame his wife for it smelling like shit
"College basketball coaches don't always make good NBA coaches just like college football coaches don't always make good NFL coaches. Sure, someone may point to an outlier, but for the most part the type of style and control someone would have had in college doesn't exist in the NBA. That's just life.   Billy Donovan has at point had coached:  - Kevin Durant - Russell Westbrook - Paul George - Chris Paul  And a bevy of mid-tiers to no success. I fully trust Presti to find a coach that's main goal will be to completely coach fundamentals - X's and O's. The Thunder are going to need it. This coaching position would be like looking not for the manager who has 20 years experience in the field but the manager who just oozes the ability to ensure their employees know exactly what to do when they need to do it.   I'm excited."
Bucks are shooting worse than Russell Westbrook in the playoffs.
Houston Rockets love Eric Bledsoe.. because he makes Russell Westbrook.. look like Michael Jordan....
"When did Westbrook ever say Beverly intentionally injured him  For all you nephews out there, Woj reported that Westbrook was ""irate"" with Beverly and nothing more: [https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--thunder-guard-russell-westbrook-to-have-knee-surgery--return-this-season-uncertain-173113321.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--thunder-guard-russell-westbrook-to-have-knee-surgery--return-this-season-uncertain-173113321.html)"

"Pat bev is more talk than anything. Russell Westbrook said it best. (paraphrasing) ""He has yall fooled, he really don't be doing shit on the court"". He talks shit, makes a scene, and works on his cardio. Otherwise he's a ghost."
"Jimmy Butler. Russell Westbrook.   Both are ranked over Lowry and Kemba with 25% shooting.   Scoring wise, the output of those two is slightly ahead of peak Rondo but they are all similar players in terms of playmaking, defense, rebounding, and motor (which separates him from the Simmons comparison)"

Russell Westbrook = Fashion Week Fultz.
"&gt;The Bucks have two ways to show Giannis they are serious about being contenders. They can take on money in trades and use future first-round picks to bring in win-now talent. To be sure, both long-term financial flexibility and building through the draft are important. But for Giannis, there’s just no reason to give the organization the benefit of the doubt. Milwaukee has already proved it will pocket any flexibility it creates. It traded its first-round pick in last season’s draft to dump Tony Snell’s contract and still let Brogdon walk a few weeks later. These are their first-round picks since drafting Giannis: Jabari Parker, Rashad Vaughn, Thon Maker, D.J. Wilson, and Donte DiVincenzo. The latter two are the only ones still on their roster, and Wilson is buried so deep on the bench that he might as well be gone. Why should Giannis believe their next five first-round picks would do anything more for him?  &gt;There are a lot of things you can do with that many picks. The Lakers packaged a bunch to get Anthony Davis. So did the Clippers to get Paul George, and the Rockets to get Russell Westbrook. None of those teams necessarily wanted to mortgage their future. But LeBron, Kawhi, and James Harden never gave them a choice. The Bucks don’t seem to care about keeping Giannis happy in the same way.  &gt;He has already seen what they will do without a gentle (or not so gentle) nudge. The Bucks signed Matthews, Korver, and Robin Lopez in the midst of an arms race among the top teams in the NBA last offseason. Let’s hope for everyone’s sake that they can do better this time around.  &gt;That assumes that Giannis even wants to be in Milwaukee anymore. There’s no way to know from the outside. He has always said that he wants to stay. But plenty of stars in his position have said similar things before asking out. The only thing we know for sure is that he could play for any team in the NBA once he becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer. It doesn’t matter who is on their books. All 30 teams would clear the necessary space to sign him if he told them he was coming.  &gt;Giannis is far from a perfect player. He’s still only 25, several years away from his prime. He’s not a good enough shooter, and he has been outdueled by Butler and Leonard in two straight postseasons. There’s a lot for him to work on. But is Milwaukee really the place where that will happen? Is he going to be pushed and challenged if he stays? Why is he spending so much time shooting 3s when he can’t make free throws or midrange jumpers? A 3-pointer is more efficient than a long 2, but a player who can’t consistently make a 10-to-15-foot jumper probably won’t make them from 25-30 feet, either. There are coaches around the league who would tell him that. But would they be valued at a place where efficiency is everything?"
"You are trying way too hard to counter a very straightforward point. Granted, ABSOLUTELY Allen Iverson is one of Westbrook's main competitors for the title of worst scorers out of the 30+ players who have won scoring titles.   I created a table, with every player who has ever won the scoring title, that lists 3 pieces of information about each player: their career TS%, the leagues average TS% for the period of time they played, and the difference between the players TS% and the league average.  I will post it later, as I wrote it out in HTML and then realized I could not paste it into reddit and was like ""f this"". Lmao.  In a nutshell, almost every last one of the 30-some players had a career TS% above the average for the period they played in. Some of them by very small amounts, mind you, but a good number - probably a third if I go by memory here - were well in excess of 30 or 40 points. And this data is comprisied mostly of retired players so it is kind to current guys like Harden, Westbrook and Durant who will likely suffer some as they play well past their peaks.  There were probably 5 or so guys that posted below average efficiency yet still viewed themselves potent enough to get the kind of shots necessary to lead the league in scoring.   The first recognized scoring champ, joe fulks, had a TS% of .374 or something when league average was .392. can you imagine? That is 18 points below league average. The other guys who stand out are Elvin Hayes (-21), Allen Iverson (-10), and Russell Westbrook (-15). Hayes played at the start of the 70's, I can only assume he thought no one was looking."

“Russell Westbrook looks to _______ in game 3 after disappointing game 2 performance”  I would say that is likely the type of quote he was hoping to get   That’s just my assumption though
Russell Westbrook shit the bed and OBJ came running
The Russell Westbrook effect
Yes because Paul George and Russell Westbrook have been so amazing in the playoffs
"&gt;Yeah a few of those players definitely did play mainly PG. I just dont see a logical argument as to why Cousy or Frazier could be considered better than Westbrook (hard to say truly since I never saw them properly play).  Cousy was just as essential for that best of all time Celtics championship streak as Russell was.  He was an absolute stud.  Frazier was one of the all time greats on defense as well as being all round great.  He also has one of the best finals performances of all time, 36/19 and 5 steals.  The argument is easy to make if you value defense.   &gt;Westbrook definitely has a bad habit of shooting his team out of games with meh defense, but every PG has had a clear weakness. Such as Magic with defense/shooting   Magic was tasked with much more difficult assignments because of his size, he often had to defend 1-5 throughout a game.  Magic was a better shooter than Westbrook as well as being a well above average efficiency scorer, so not sure that is a great criticism.  &gt;or Stockton with his scoring not being elite (efficient but not elite) and getting a lot of benefits with what types of passes he was given assists for.  Yeah the assist calls were super generous on that squad.  He still passes the eye test if you watch his play though.  &gt;I think with 2/3 rings you could make the case for him over Nash/Stockton/Kidd/West depending on how much value is put on rings and that Westbrook MVP and amazing triple double statline.   It depends entirely on the role he plays in getting those chips imo.  &gt;I agree with you on alot of what is said however and most likely he wouldn't crack top 5 but top 10 he will achieve imo.  I hope he does, I want to see him succeed.  He has remarkable potential being held back by a history of poor decision making."
"No it's not. Pat Bev injured russell westbrook, Pat bev dives at people's legs.... Caruso doesn't. It has zero to do w/ race. This is what I hate so much, calling every lil thing racial is corny AF."

"Jamal ""Russell Westbrook"" Murray"
"Jamal ""Russell Westbrook"" Murray tonight"
Jamal Murray doing his best Russell Westbrook impression
" &gt;He has the Russell Westbrook, ""I have to do it (instead of team ball)"" mentality too much for my liking  This statement right here is absolutely 100% false and it actually got me upset that you think this. RJ is one of the more selfless Knicks when it comes to play on the basketball court. He's more ""I rather do the right play then do it by myself"". Your statement would be factual though if you're talking about his time in Duke."
"RJ's game vs Houston was great. He needs to make his open 3s and yes he is stronger (but has to get even stronger).  He has the Russell Westbrook, ""I have to do it (instead of team ball)"" mentality too much for my liking  But Herro has really impressed me in the bubble, he has really gotten better. His handle has gotten better. He isn't a rookie anymore. He is seasoned.    Hard to succeed on the Knicks, but i like Tom Thibs (i think he might help)"
"Charlie Brown, Rodney Dangerfield, and Russell Westbrook."
"Russell ""Good Porn"" Westbrook"
"To be fair, this isn't one bad day and it's not just like he's off, he's been actively horrific.   That might sound like hyperbole until you learn that Russell Westbrook has the worst Win shares of any player in the playoffs at -0.4.   Granted, it's one bad week. But if you are the worst of all players and you're getting paid a max deal, criticism is more than justified."
Russell Westbrook thinks the Raptors can't shoot
This is like when me and my girlfriend spend some time together figuring out ways we can both be better. Russell Westbrook is me in this scenario.
"You just going to conveniently leave out that the media dragged Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers through the mud because of load management, despite Russell Westbrook doing the same thing, and then fining them earlier for it.  You going to leave out the ""chemistry issues"" that are supposedly plaguing our locker room, and how the media tried to push that narrative mid-season.  Or how about the hit pieces against Kawhi Leonard and his uncle about asking for perks despite the NBA having already completed an investigation and not finding anything substantial.  &gt;great organization  Well, Clippers are a better organization than the Lakers, that's for sure. Clippers don't have the star power/never will, but we also didn't have our team president quit out of nowhere without telling anyone. And then leaking a bunch of stuff to the media lol.  &gt;crappers  lol, Laker fans were never a creative or intelligent bunch. flippers was better"
"So what'd Jeanie/Lebron pay the league?  You know when the Lakers played an injured Portland team and a Rockets team with Russell Westbrook recovering from a quad tear?  EDIT: Keep downvoting ya hypocrites, you know I'm right."
"[Gran Destino - 5th Floor]  *Ding!*  The elevator doors open with a slight lurch. Russell Westbrook in his Honor Thy Gift Tshirt and summer slacks walks out. He nods to the security guard as the guard points to his right.   Westbrook shuffles his feet and stops in front of room 513. He checks his outfit, clears his throat and sheepishly knocks on the door.   A booming voice says: “Come in. I’ve been waiting for you”   It’s dimly lit inside the room, with the only light coming from the glow of the flat screen tv affixed to the wall. There are stacks of Adidas boxes, cases of BodyArmor and a trash bag they seemingly is filled with beard hair - at least enough for a 100 beards.   “Have a seat, Russell.”   Westbrook looks around and there’s nowhere to sit except at the foot of the bed, nor does he see where the voice is coming from. He sits right on the edge.   With a loud hiss, a cryogenic device emerges from under the bed and cold air fills the room.   Westbrook tucks his arms inside of his t shirt.   James Harden emerges from the chamber, clothed in his Disney World robe.   Harden makes his way over to the trash bag and pulls out a beard.   As he starts attaching the famous beard on his face, Harden says “Russell, talk to me. What’s going on with you lately?”  Ignoring how disturbed he’s feeling about this scene, Westbrook sits up and shouts “ What are you talking about bro?! I’m Russell Westbrook baby!”  Harden looks into his bag of beards and gives a huge sigh. He sits down next to Westbrook on the bed.   “Russell, I need you to do this one thing for me. For us. For the city of Houston.”  Before Westbrook has a chance to respond, Harden locks eyes with him as his pupils illuminate with the Rockets logo.   Westbrook’s body relaxes as he goes into a trance.   “It’s time.”  Harden pulls on his beard 3 times. His mouth gapes open and a loud gurgling sound emerges.   The room starts to shake as Harden’s beard illuminates in a red glow.   The red glow gets brighter and brighter and with a loud digesting sound, Harden engulfs Russell Westbrook’s body.   The room flashes white and Harden vomits the body of Westbrook onto the floor.   Westbrook starts coughing and spitting up fluid and screams “what the fuck man!”    Harden grabs Westbrook’s head and looks at him, making eye contact again.   However, Westbrook looks different. As Westbrook looks at him in fear, he blinks.   Harden smiles, noticing the new mark on Westbrook’s eye that says CP3.   “Welcome back. I promised you would be back in your full glory, master! I have found you the perfect host!”  CP3 gives one last cough to expel a vial containing a mini-westbrook. He hands the vial to Harden, who tucks it into his beard.   “The transformation is complete. Let’s win this ship”.   [End Scene]"
The rockets are not paying Russell Westbrook more than 30million to be a shorter clint capela.
"&gt;its true...  &gt; &gt; &gt;none of those dudes in the 1950 and 1960s NBA would make it in the league at this modern era.  &gt; &gt;Maybe role/bench players but not starters  You are nuts.  There are loads of all time greats from that era who would easily be stars today.  Wilt, Russell, Robertson, Baylor, West, Pettit, Bellamy, Lucas, Thurmond, Reed, Cousy, Havlicek, Frazier.  Wilt was Shaq with more athleticism and better defense, Robertson is a significantly better version of Westbrook, Russell would be a lock for at least a few DPOYs, Baylor was basically a better rebounding Wade, and Jerry West could sink it from deep and break ankles, he would thrive in today's game."
Bertrand Russell Westbrook
"So you’re really saying without a hint of irony that if you got the same shots as Russell Westbrook in the NBA playoffs, you would have made more of them than he did?"
"When he's 100% he can mitigate some of that, and at least do something when Harden is off the floor.  He's clearly unable to do anything right now, he can't even handle the ball, he's basically Tony Allen on offense while still being Russell Westbrook on defense unfortunately"
"He just came off injury.   Russell Westbrook has more upside than any of these guys.  If you are trying to win a championship, you pick westbrook"
Another interesting titbit: the most recent time an NBA team lost to a non-NBA team was [OKC losing to Real Madrid (in OT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_played_between_NBA_and_international_teams) during the 2016 preseason. Starting for OKC at PG was the MVP-to-be Russell Westbrook. Coming off the bench for Madrid at PG was a [17yo Luka Doncic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRJBeaez-94).

RUSSELL WESTBROOK WOKE UP FEELING DANGEROUS 😳😳😳  4-15 shooting 💦💦💦  1-7 from 3 🔥🔥🔥  7 turnovers 😈😈😈  +/-  -14 🐐🐐🐐
"&gt; Westbrook’s success rate on those threes, factoring in the usage, is among the worst in history. In the NBA’s existence, only five players have 500-plus games under their belt with at least five attempts from deep per 100 possessions. Out of those five, Westbrook’s 30.7% clip is the second-worst. Only Ronnie Price logged enough games and shot volume to rank lower (30.2%). However, it’s worth noting that Westbrook has played 283 more games than Price and has taken a lot more total shots.  &gt;So, if you want to run it solely by raw volume, we should take a look at the worst three-point shooters with at least 3,000 career attempts. Only six players in league history have made less than 32% of their looks with such usage: Westbrook, Jerry Stackhouse, Allen Iverson, Gary Payton, Baron Davis, and Vernon Maxwell.  &gt;Westbrook, at the moment, is the worst.  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/shaneyoung/2019/11/09/just-how-bad-is-russell-westbrooks-outside-shooting/amp/  Westbrook is one of the worst volume shooters ever. Every outside shot he attempts costs his team in expected points, and he takes a huge amount of them. He shoots teams out of games constantly."
"Dumbest fucking narrative ever. So any player that calls for the ball when it matters is a super star. So Russell Westbrook is a superstar because he has ""that dog in him"" and calls for the ball when it matters? AD is on another level when it comes to contributing to a winning than Westbrook is. God damn people don't realize players go about winning in different ways."
"Russell “If you don’t love me at my worst, you don’t deserve me at my best” Westbrook  Rolls off the tongue nicely."
Russell Westbrook and terrible stats? Colour me surprised!
That's the secret to Russell Westbrook: you don't try to shut him down. You get out of his way and let him shoot his team out the game.
Russell Westbrook never ceases to amaze me. I don’t know how he has managed to go his entire career being Westbrick and not expanding his game beyond jacking up random ass threes. Lakers straight up rightfully disrespecting him and leaving him unguarded to shoot his stupid ass shots while everyone else plays like an actual team.
I’m not going to kill Russell Westbrook for the bad game either. He’s still working his way back. And there was a point earlier in the season where he quite frankly looked like the best Houston Rocket. I think he’ll be fine

Russell Westbrook got cooked lmao.
My buddy is the freakiest athlete Ive met and has a 38 inch running vert. He’s 6’2 and can dunk easily. He seams like he’s soaring. Russell Westbrook is 6’3 and has a 36.5 vert and can seems like he’s jumping out of the room sometimes. Lebron has a 40+ inch vert and he’s 6’9. Dude is made for the game.
Russell Westbrook is not going to Rockets = Thunder still have hope     Thunder still have hope = Not trading Paul George     Paul George is not going to Clippers = Kawhi is also not going to Clippers     Kawhi is not going to Clippers = Kawhi is going to Lakers to form the biggest 3.     So pay some respect to Westbrook.

How bad is Russell Westbrook praying for the Clippers to blow this series so everyone forgets about him?
"[Qué?](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2017/11/29/victor-oladipo-praises-russell-westbrook-during-career-year-i-learned-so-much-from-him/) _____ “One thing I learned from him (Russ) is he’s on 110 every day. The thing about me is that he’s on 110, I’m trying to get to 115. That’s something he kinda instilled in me without doing anything. Just being himself and that’s how I am here.” _____ “He’s (Westbrook) a future hall of famer no question, and in order to get that, I’m going to have to put in the work and put in another level that I’ve never worked before. That’s what I did this summer and it’s paying off for me.”"
Literally nobody will say that.  If anything a whole generation will grow up seeing the triple doubles and think he should be a top 10 player of all time.  They will say is Russell Westbrook the best to never win a ring.
"I don’t believe that.   It’s recency bias for starters.   And for one - this sub isn’t one opinion, one day a player does bad and the haters come out. The next day he does good and the haters are silent while those who support the player or just enjoy watching great players perform great start talking. It’s not so black and white. And to top that off, people would rather see the bad in a single player or superstar rather than accept that the other team might just be very good. People would rather say “Russell Westbrook is shit” than realize that Lebron, AD and the Lakers are just a well oiled machine that clamped the Rockets. Neither Harden or Russ are bad. Anyone who thinks he’s not a good player is hating. Seriously, it’s Lebron James and the Lakers.   Same shit happened and Mark Cuban said it - Why is it that the losing team is always copped out with “they just didn’t want it,” or “they played bad” when the reality is the winning team executed perfectly what they needed to do to win rather than either being bad.   I will say he has one of the lower IQs of most superstars, but that doesn’t take away from his athleticism or how great of a player he is. He just has bad nights. But I don’t think he’s not HOF material.  He’s an MVP - his triple double season. Dudes a stud. Just needs to learn to play off the ball, hit his shots. That’s all it takes for him. He’s not bad tho."
"""Fuck them kids""  - Russell Westbrook"
"Oh wow, you mean he’s not as good as the players you listed? Color me surprised.  I don’t even know where I said it, but I said Westbrook wasn’t as efficient as other top 15 scorers. His efficiency is one of the weaknesses of his game. But 53.6% is not a bad shooting percentage. And you even included Tatum who’s only 3% better despite having the luxury of having other scorers to pass the ball to rather than having to take bad shots for the sake of the offense. Russ has to do that all the time when Harden is off the floor or playing poorly. Average numbers for efficiency are misleading bc it’s inflated by centers and superstars. A median number is a much more accurate way to compare him.   I’m not going to continue this, bc you’re being dense. Him being 5% or less different from his peers is enough to negate his shot creating and rebounding and passing? If somebody compared Russ to Luka or Harden or Lillard or LeBron they’d be wrong. He’s obviously not that level guy. He’s a borderline all star who has to take a lot of shots bc his offense needs him to. With KD he shot 17 shots a game and now he’s shoots 22.   Just, stop with this garbage argument. I’m so tired of hearing it. Idk how anybody but y’all is tired of hearing it. It’s the same shit and it cherry picks and overstates arguments against him. He’s not an efficient scorer, but he’s not this terribly inefficient scorer. Stop with the circle jerk about how much he sucks  **Edit**   Did you care to mention how he’s within 2% of CJ McCollum, D’Angelo Russell, Nikola Vucevic, Pascal and Kristaps despite taking 4-5 more shots than them? I never argued that Westbrook wasn’t less efficient than other all stars. Just that he’s not leagues worse than other all stars like you and every other dude wants to make him seem. It’s not true. Take this argument else where, it’s so so annoying and clearly comes from some personal vendetta against the guy."
"Again, if you say Westbrook’s efficiency terrible, I expect you to call all those other players inefficient too. If Westbrook is terrible at 53.6%, I expect you to at least call Kristaps (55.1%), Pascal (55.4%), D’Angelo Russell (55.6%), and Nikola Vucevic (54.9%) at *least* having “really bad efficiency”. A &gt;2% difference just shouldn’t take you from terrible to even just bad. I expect you to say those guys aren’t all stars bc of their efficiency too. If you do that, then I won’t argue you with you, I’ll just disagree with you. But for some reason, Westbrook is thrown into a completely different category than everyone else even though he is very much in the same ballpark.  He also isn’t below average. The league average is higher than your “average” player bc of Centers, who shoot really high efficiencies, and superstars like LeBron Giannis and Russ, who inflate the number. Westbrook is better than the median player in efficiency. Not by much. Which contributes to my point, his efficiency is one of the weaknesses in his game, but his efficiency is not that bad, and it’s not that good.   Westbrook also shouldnt like, get bonus negative marks for shooting a lot. A guy like Duncan Robinson or Mitchell Robinson shoot much higher efficiencies than Russell Westbrook. Does that mean they should just shoot 50 times a game? No, bc their efficiency is a product of their shot selection, and their shot selection is a product of their role. Some roles require you to shoot bad shots to keep your team in the game, you have to bail out your offense sometimes. Russ does that a lot and he maintains these pedestrian efficiency numbers. That should be a complement, bc most players efficiency would absolute rank under those conditions. Russ is good enough where it doesn’t. I find his efficiency numbers impressive bc 1) he’s known to be an inefficient scorer yet he’s still in the same ballpark of similar value guys 2) he’s in a role (the rockets need him in this role) where he’s naturally going to be less efficient, maybe much less so  Just quoting efficiency without contextualizing that efficiency is how we get terrible takes like Allen Iverson not being a top 50 player of all time. If you look AI’s numbers, his effiency is terrible. But you need to contextualize that in that he was his teams entire offense and had to take a ton of ridiculous and terrible shots bc nobody else could create anything for that team. If he would’ve just taken high percentage shots, they wouldn’t have made the playoffs most years. They needed offense.  Even if you didn’t contextualize the efficiency. Why is CJ and Kristaps and Vucevic and DLo in the all star conversation but Russell absolutely cannot bc he’s just too inefficient? Completely ignoring how many shots he creates and rebounds and assists and steals he gets too. The coaches choose the bench all stars right? Why do you think coaches, who clearly know more about the NBA than both us, consistently vote him into the all star game? Or why a GM who loves efficiency chose to get him despite his efficiency? Bc he’s actually a good player despite efficiency being one of his weaknesses, and his efficiency is not as bad as you make it out to be. You see how annoying this conversation is? Just ignoring everything he does well and extremely overstating what he does poorly?  He’s not MVP level. Whoever said that was wrong. Look at his MVP numbers and this year’s one time and it’s obvious. But this efficiency argument is totally biased against him and it’s annoying see the same argument that’s frankly, a bad argument. If you hate Russ’s play style there’s plenty of good reasons to feel that way, just say that. But don’t make this confirmation bias argument about how he so obviously shoots so poorly that it negates everything else he does positively.   I also think the Rockets lost the trade. Not because Russ is a bad player. But bc he doesn’t fit in our freaking system. He can’t shoot. It drives me crazy. Not to mention we gave up like 4 picks. Worst trade of Morey’s career. I’m totally with you there. The efficiency argument is just so tired."
Russell Westbrook is the evidence proved that regular season means nothing.
“I would rather coach Malcolm Brogdon than Russell Westbrook”
"Alexa, tell me everything about Russell Westbrook in one gif."
Houston *was* better with him on the bench in this series. Russell Westbrook is the primary reason this series wasn’t close.   Which is precisely why the Rockets are fucked.
"realistically, who’s trading for Russell Westbrook?"
You literally asked if Russell Westbrook had any fans. The answer is no shit
This quote OP posted is the perfect example.   Praises himself for the work he puts in. But it’s everyone else who needs to be better. There’s no responsibility taken by your Star. Everyone not named James Harden or Russell Westbrook is under the bus.
"I want to take such an easy opportunity to hate on Russell Westbrook, but I'm going to pass.   The issue is James either hasn't figured out how to take over a playoff series or simply doesn't have the ability. Morey is doing a lot right, but there are levels to superstardom. And in the rare air of top 5, James has to figure something out.   And I don't see Mike ever helping James solve that riddle because he hasn't been able to solve it either in his own situation. There are microadjustments that need to be made in the NBA playoffs that neither of them have figured out."
"If Carmelo Anthony could, Russell Westbrook definitely can"
"Dude he's an incredible basketball player. Like consistently one of at least the top 20 in the world through his whole career. (I would rate higher, but that's personal opinion). I understand he isn't as good as ha once was a few years ago, but there's a reason that so many players and coaches think so highly of him.  He had a few bad games this series, but remember just a few games ago he was the one keeping it competitive out there. The better team won, but I expect he'll come back next season and continue to play at a high level. People just see bad games and love to hate on the guy.  I mean come on you just described Russell Westbrook as low effort.  And yes, generally fans will choose the more athletic and exciting players as their favourites over someone who is maybe more consistent and less flashy - people love highlights!"
What I will tell my kids about Russell Westbrook:  *“He made bad teams good....and he also made great teams good.”*
The rockets will never have a 5 that plays in the post as long as Russell Westbrook is on the team. It's not possible.
Russell Westbrook is the Anthony Keidis of basketball. It is not possible to be any more extra than him.
I have the same feelings about Russell Westbrook that I do about Manny Machado in baseball. I legit don’t think that any roster that has either guy on their team could ever win a Championship.
"Not rooting for a team for a while has given me the clarity to realize just how much better a player LeBron James is than guys like James Harden and Russell Westbrook.  It’s like night and day.  I’m not sure how the Rockets can beat a team led by LeBron, besides recruiting a good defensive big man like Giannis Antetokounmpo.  They really need size and leadership.  This small ball shit doesn’t work against teams with a brain because it relies on scrambling defenses, and teams with good defenses are just going to guard man to man."
"I don't know if overrated is the right word.  I think that at this point, we know what Mike D'Antoni will bring to a team.  Whether he's Marty Schottenheimer or Andy Reid (who finally won one after years of choking) is yet to be seen.  I've always loved watching D'Antoni teams, they're fun to watch and emphasize all the parts of basketball I enjoy most and what makes the NBA so exciting.  I'd rather watch those old Suns teams than Popp's Spurs almost all the time, I LOVED watching Nash and Amare.  But, we know the flaws and the reasons that D'Antoni's teams always seem to fall \*this\* short, even his best ones.    And that's why I think that James Harden and Russell Westbrook are both great and horrible players for D'Antoni.  Both do things that truly excel in D'Antoni's offense, but I don't think either of them are the kind of player that will push his teams over the edge and win a title, without the right people around them.  And even though it's like a 2K fever dream come to life, I still have no idea what Harden and Westbrook on the same floor was supposed to look like, they both are way too similar to me in needing the ball so much, it just seemed like a fun 'what if' idea that wasn't going to work in a best of 7 against the elite teams."
russell westbrook is exactly how i play in 2k21
"Trade Russell Westbrook, you can't win with him, and get Donovan Mitchell, switch James harden back at the 1 , problem solved 😎"
"No recency bias, Westbrook is the first person to have a career average of 4 turnovers per game meaning its been a problem for a long time.  https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/03/22/russell-westbrook-first-in-history-to-average-four-turnovers-per-game/"
"Former MVP Derrick Rose was asked who's better: him or Russell Westbrook. Rose answered ""I don't compare myself with anybody"", rolled up his sleeve to show a tattoo that says ""High Basketball IQ"" and continued ""I'll let you interpret that however you want""."
"Wiggins is on a max contract as well.   If it doesn’t workout, Golden State could easily trade Harden for an asset rich package if need be. He’s a Top 10 player, lots of teams would love to have him. He’s not Russell Westbrook."
"I like the AK analogy better. Because we used to say AK stands for Anna kournikova, because while it looks pretty, it never wins.   and in the NBA James harden and Russell Westbrook are definitely Anna kournikova."
"LeBron James Kevin Durant James Harden Chris Paul Anthony Davis Kyle Lowry Jalen Brown Kemba Walker Jayson Tatum Giannis Antetokounpo Khris Middleton Jimmy Butler Kawhi Leonard Paul George Jamal Murray Nikola Jokic Stephen Curry Klay Thompson Draymond Green Luka Doncic Kristaps Porzingis Damian Lillard CJ Mccollum Devin Booker Ben Simmons Joel Embiid Donovan Mitchell Rudy Gobert Jrue Holiday Brandon Ingram Kyrie Irving Bradley Beal  John Wall Karl Anthony Towns Ja Morant Kevin Love Zion Williamson Nikola Vucevic Bam Adebayo Demar Derozan Zach Lavine  I'd easily take those players above Westbrook. Westbrook is raw talent but has poor basketball IQ. He can't make any adjustments because he only knows how to play one way. There's a reason the last time Westbrook shot above 50% in the playoffs besides game 4 was in 2016. All the players I mentioned above can adjust their game and are simply better pairings than Russell Westbrook. I felt bad for the Rockets because Harden should have had the ball every possession but because they couldn't figure out what to do with Russ, they just gave him the ball instead and had Harden stand around. Like I said, Westbrook is a top 20 player to me IF what you want is someone who can carry your team from the trenches and want to sell tickets. He's however, not a very good player from a championship building process. The fact that OKC became a better team without Russ shows just how replaceable Russ can be. The fact that the Rockets, with CP3, was a better version of these Rockets tells me enough. And the fact that Russ continues to play only one way is enough evidence for me to view him as a liability in the playoffs."
... Do Russell Westbrook (twice) and Kevin Durant suddenly not count or something? What the fuck universe is this?
· Zero conscience  · Out of control   · Questionable BBIQ   Ladies and Gentlemen - Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook has a history of beefing with fans. And at what point do the fans start to wonder if WB is the real problem? Especially, since...earlier this series, he was yelling at fans lol  He's a hypocrite. Plain and simple.  Also he was looking at Rondo's brother before anything was said, go look at the clip. He was looking for trouble, and he found it, in the form of a 20 point loss lmao imagine being down 25 and caring more about what a fan says than winning."
Russell Westbrook has to be the biggest sensitive Nancy in the league.
Eh I think you saw what Westbrook is and what people have been saying for years really a player with one gear and that is to beat you over the head with him being a superior athlete over you. He cant shoot outside of really his 2 staples the bank shot from the side or running downhill and a quick pull up around the FT line.   He is such an athlete he is going to accidently get 15 points most nights.   I will add this his attitude is terrible I watched him about 2 years ago live in DC and the Wizards CRUSHED OKC it was over by half time almost so Donovan called it and put the reserves in. I watched Russell sit at the end of bench and not talk to anyone or help in timeouts for the whole second half he was just being a baby

Rajon Rondo’s brother William took the stands at the WCF yelling “Where he at?” as he looked for Russell Westbrook.
"The guy is simply a hater. Russell Westbrook is not one of the worst shooters in the NBA. That's straight baloney. Obviously, he can't shoot threes but he's got an outstanding mid-range jumper and his free throw percentage has always been decent (including down the stretch). Russ was one the main reasons the Rockets managed to clinch the playoff spot before the pandemic. How quickly they forget! Honestly, I understand all the frustration with Russell being a fan of him. At this point, it does seem he just wasted his career. But that doesn't mean you can be that disrespectful to top-3 point guard of the past decade."
"LMAO.  Dont sleep!  Taj Gibson, Julius Randle, Bobby Portis (43m) &lt;=&gt; Russell Westbrook (43m)  NYK gets a marquee name for MSG.  The new Melo.  PG slot waiting for him or cp3 or john wall.  Everydody dissing knicks for those contracts last year totally missed their plan.  Rockets have no bigs at all, but then get three four-fives to support Harden for a one year dip next year, and then they get that capspace in 2022."
"Russell Westbrook a first and 5 seconds :3  Now im reality, nothing that could interest them..."
"They did, his name is Russell Westbrook, loves to handle the ball just not very big"
&gt; wish they could find literally any other **ex-player** to take his spot. Gimme Darius Miles or Mo Williams or **Russell Westbrook** or something.  holy shit the shade
"I think it's more honest to just say 53.6% is bad efficiency, well below league average. I also love the presumption that I'm supposed to be impressed that Russell Westbrook is shooting at Julius Randle levels."
Russell Westbrook would also lead that Bulls team to 60ish wins and the ECF. There’s no reason to believe otherwise.
"You mean when he had Durant, Harden, and Ibaka as teammates who are each individually great contributors to winning---with Durant and Ibaka NBA champions by now and Harden as an all-time great in offense in a revolutionary system. Meanwhile, Russell Westbrook is just an empty stat-padder (you gotta admit this) and never a winning player. Just compare those players again then and now and you see how much the better players have improved their skills. Russell's unevolved game after more than a decade of playing speaks a lot about him as a player. Sucks that whichever team he goes he's just a curse to the team's chances of winning."
https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3992/james-harden  1 bad game for Harden.  https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook  2 for Russ.
"It actually mostly showed that if you create a system solely based on 3 pt shooting, you probably shouldn’t have traded for Russell Westbrook"
"Russell Westbrook being traded from the Thunder, DMC from the Kings, Blake from the Clippers, and  Love from the Wolves all come to mind. Debatable if they're superstars or not but all were in the star level at least when they were traded"
"&gt;This alone is enough to tell that you have no idea what you’re talking about. Russell Westbrook isn’t even close to the same player he was during his MVP season.  He isn't because he's only a bit older and because he was playing coming off a quad injury; he likely wasn't 100%, but that's still no excuse to choke as bad as he did vs. us.   Overall, he played bad against us because of the defensive schemes we employed... we make our competition look worse than the Clips make their competition look, that's what you're missing.  &gt;... that had like the 11th best offence and 7th best defense since the trades?  \#1 Defense in the playoffs until they faced us... just like Portland had the #1 Defense before they faced us  &gt;Huh? The point is that they were winning off the back of an unsustainably good run by Damian Lillard. No shit they’d get significantly worse when he reverted back to normal.  He dropped off because... HE PLAYED THE LAKERS  Not only did the Clippers cheer when the Lakers got the tougher bracket, the Nuggets fuckin tanked on purpose so they wouldn't have to face the Rockets; you have no fuckin argument bro, Rockets &gt; Nuggets &gt; Blazers &gt; Mavs"
"&gt; 2 MVPs  This alone is enough to tell that you have no idea what you’re talking about. Russell Westbrook isn’t even close to the same player he was during his MVP season.   &gt; unstoppable small ball   ... that had like the 11th best offence and 7th best defense since the trades?   &gt; But they were winning, right?   Huh? The point is that they were winning off the back of an unsustainably good run by Damian Lillard. No shit they’d get significantly worse when he reverted back to normal."
"&gt; westbrook was 5 years younger and not injury prone  Lol what. Russell Westbrook has had knee surgery like 4 times since Pat Bev took him out, not to mention other injuries. The lengths Rockets fans will go to justify Dary Morey's bullshit is hilarious"
"Russell Westbrook is petulant child, too funny."
Russell Westbrook is beside himself. Running around Disney World begging (thru texts) the Lakers for William Rondo's hotel room.
Marc Jackson used Rondo's bro being 'employed' by the NBA as a barber as a way to be self righteous which is Jacksons MO. Tbh I only posted this because I can't stand Jackson and wish they could find literally any other ex-player to take his spot. Gimme Darius Miles or Mo Williams or Russell Westbrook or something.
"I’d say John Wall is the most untradeable due to the fact he hasn’t played in like 2 years. Russell Westbrook after him because he’s definitely still a good player but he’s very flawed, and he hasn’t done much at all to improve his game since he’s been in the league. Chris Paul at number 3 because even with his contract he’s still a good player, and a great team leader. That Thunder team exceeded a lot of expectations this year. I think a team would be willing to eat CP3’s contract."
"Russell Westbrook for the next 3 years will be making:   	$41,358,814	$44,211,146	$47,063,478  Good luck on rockets trying to find another team to take him and ggs for the team who will take him."
Russell Westbrook to Golden State------&gt;confirmed
&gt;I've seen people like yourself talk  He showed you the stats and you can't argue with facts and now you are throwing a Russell Westbrook in here. Lmao
"It’s not even worth the argument, people just say whatever from the comfort of their fingertips because they simply love Russell Westbrook even if he is acting like a kid with tantrums"
Russell Westbrook really taking this shit too far.
"Hey man they had an MVP playing center. Granted, it was Russell Westbrook but still."
"It’s not even worth the argument, people just say whatever from the comfort of their fingertips because they simply don’t like Russell Westbrook"
Man. that Russell Westbrook trade with okc is looking even worse now.   I think Russell and harden are equally un-clutch and aren’t the greatest leaders or winners.   I don’t understand why the rockets thought putting the two together would work. They could’ve just built a little bit more around harden and cp3 instead of blowing it all up risking it on Russell Westbrook :///
The cute part is that the houston fans actually thought they could win for a night or two before getting reminded that their team mortgaged their future for Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook traumatized by 2 different guys waving goodbye the past two postseasons.
"Harden deserved it more at the time with his equally monstrous stats and it was the fruit of a ""revolutionary"" system and style of play (say what you want but it really is). Meanwhile, also at the time, this nba player called Russell Westbrook puts out empty stats and chases triple doubles by stealing rebounds last-second assists.   MVP is a regular season award but Westbrick never having made it out of the first round of the playoffs just emphasizes how he is such a non-winning player."
"Russell ""Shooter McGavin"" Westbrook"
"""very very disappointing"" is very appropriate for an nba player called Russell Westbrook"
You can break lots of records when you are playing against a loser called Russell Westbrook
AND SUCH A BIG HOLE AT THAT. YOU CAN'T WIN ANYTHING WITH THAT NBA PLAYER CALLED RUSSELL WESTBROOK
&gt; called Russell Westbrook “trash” and nothing more  I mean...that’s pretty bad. Russ needs to control his emotions it that would be enough to offend most people.
that's 4-5-9 no  I drive and get blocked  I can't make any jumpers  Name's Russell Westbrook
He kind of it when your co star is Russell Westbrook who defenses dont even acknowledge as a shooter on ball.  Whats Harden gonna do wait for Russ to dribble into traffic and pick uo his dribble.  Harden at least can go to the stepback.
Russell Westbrook trickin y’all man. He’s runnin around and doing nothing.
"My drives get blocked,  I brick open looks,   you guessed it right I’m Russell Westbrook"
Russell “Isiah Thomas” Westbrook
"Seriously speaking 1 on 1, Russell Westbrook is one of the best players lol."
"&gt; I'm wondering where the vitriol with Russell Westbrook comes from.   C'mon man.  He's an extremely poor sport, loves to talk but can't take criticism.  No one is saying he has bad character off the court, that he isn't a great man.  But on the court, as an NBA player, as a star, he just doesn't get anything done when it comes to stars and can't handle facing criticism"

Fun fact the Rockets will be paying Russell Westbrook $47 million in 2023.
When are y’all going to learn that no team is ever going to win anything with Russell Westbrook.
It's always someone else's fault with Harden.  First Dwight Howard was the scapegoat for Rockets fans saying that he was holding Harden back.  Then it was Melo's fault.  Last year he just knew that CP3 was the obstacle.  Now it'll be Russell Westbrook.  Maybe it's time to face the truth that this guy is not a winning player.
if the nba is so worried about ratings they should’ve made tonight a double header. lakers/rockets then the heavyweight bout of william rondo/russell westbrook.
"They really don’t have a lot of options. They can try to sign some pieces and see what happens, but I don’t see how they can trade their way to being better.  James Harden and Russell Westbrook are two of the best players in the league. I don’t think they need to blow it up, but in the NBA...the options are limited"

Russell Westbrook plays basketball like he has a short attention span
"Russell ""Where he at"" WestBrook"
"https://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/1304968102644535296?s=20  &gt; Here's the problem: Who wants Russell Westbrook? &gt;  &gt; Not many teams even need a PG, nevermind one past his prime making over $40M three more years. &gt;  &gt; Multiple NBA execs told me this series they'd take Rajon Rondo at $2.5M per over Russ. That says it all. &gt;  &gt; Tough situation for Houston.  KOC unloading the choppa tonight"
"Russell Westbrook is going to damn near single handedly cripple the chances for Houston to make any significant changes to their roster over the next 3 years.  I do not say this lightly, what COVID-19 has done will GREATLY impact the salary cap in upcoming seasons. The start of the 2020-2021 season will not begin until after Dec 25, 2020 and will be a shortened season. The league is going to take a massive hit in salary cap structure and room.  This affects every one. This post probably has absolutely no reason to be here and for that I truly apologize. I merely come here saying every single team and every season going forward for the next several seasons is going to be affected and things are going to be significantly impacted.   But the reason I point out Russell Westbrook more than anyone else is because of his future contract which everyone knows is massive. But given the picks and pick swaps the Rockets gave up, and in combination with the guaranteed money on their books in the form of James Harden and Eric Gordon, the Rockets are in a bad, bad spot.   Russ: $41,006,000, $43,848,000, $46,662,000  Harden: $40,842,000, $43,848,000, $46,872,000  Eric Gordon: $16,869,276, $18,218,818, $19,568,360  All of those do not include this year’s salaries  That is an average of $97M to $113M every year between 3 players and prior to the start of the 2021-2022 season, the salary cap was projected to be in the neighborhood of $125M and that figure will not be met for years to come.   Good luck Houston"
Fun fact Moreyball is going to be paying Russell Westbrook $47 million in 2023.

"Could’ve broken this news three years ago, while we’re at it Chris Paul, John wall, and Russell Westbrook will all be opting in for 40 mil+."
"The fact that I do hoop has taught me dudes will back you down 21 times if they are playing just to win lmao. Yes, that exists literally especially if dudes is doing unlimited dribbles. Not only have I seen people not get gassed go up against smaller players, but we are talking about Russell Westbrook lmao."
This is exactly the take I am talking about. Russell Westbrook in no universe until the heat death of the universe will back another NBA player down 21 straight times and score.   &gt; And lol @ thinking Russ is going to get tired in a game of 21  You’ve clearly never played pick up if you think you’re backing anyone down 21 times straight and not getting gassed lol.
"This thread is old but here I go  East  1. Bucks: Despite the early exit, they will still get the best record in the NBA and Giannis will put historic numbers 2.

Heat: They made the finals, and they are only getting better so I can't see them any lower 4. Raptors: Kyle Lowry is aging and I can't see them any higher 5. 76ers: They will have injury issues and they won't have home court, but they will do well in the playoffs 6. Nets: KD and Kyrie will be rusty and start slow, end well 7. Hawks: will be way behind the Nets, but in the East, they could sneak into the playoffs 8. Pacers: Oladipo will be bad and their best player TJ Warren isn't better than any of the best players on better teams and they need to trade Myles Turner 9. Wizards: John Wall will be rusty and either Wall or Beal will get traded but they will barely miss the playoffs 10. Bulls: They are a young team but I don't see them making the playoffs yet, but maybe in a few years 11. Magic: they got lucky making the playoffs the last 2 years and the magic won't be there anymore 12. Hornets: They got the number 3 pick who is just enough to keep them out of the bottom 3 in the East 13. Knicks: They didn't get anyone yet but they are a young team who might even make the playoffs in a few years 14. Pistons: They are in a huge mess and nothing good will happen, but at least they're better than the Cavs 15. Cavs: Andre Drummond and Kevin Love will get traded, and they will have the worst record in the league  West  1. Lakers: They won't be as good as they were in 2020, but still good enough for the one seed 2. Nuggets: After Jamal Murray went off in the postseason, he will have a breakout year, while Jokic will play solid basketball 3. Clippers: They will have load managing and that will cost them 5 or so games 4. Mavericks: They are only going to get better, while a lot of the other teams in the West will take a step back 5. Warriors: They will start off rusty, but they will get better as the season advances 6. Jazz: I wanted to put them higher, but there is too much competition, although in the East they could be a top 4 seed 7. Rockets: There ceiling stays the same but the floor goes down, and they are an aging team 8. Trail Blazers: They will be one of the best 8 seeds in the history of the game, but there is too much competition to put them higher and Dame is aging 9. Pelicans: I hate to put them out of the playoffs, but Zion and Ingram are still young 10. Timberwolves: KAT, D'angelo Russell and whoever they pick in the draft will do well, but way to many teams to choose from 11. Grizzlies: Ja Morant will only get better, and I really hate to put them out of the playoffs 12. Thunder: Cp3 will get traded, so they will take a step back 13. Suns: Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton are great, and if they were in the East they would be in the playoff hunt 14. Kings: Great young core but too much teams ahead 15.

"People hate on him as expected but the dude’s been covering every major sport since the 1970’s lol he knows his shit, he just values intangibles and mental toughness over everything else.  He predicted Tebow would make the playoffs when he took over a 1-4 Denver team in 2011 (this one is actually insane when you consider how it happened)  He predicted Russell Westbrook would average a triple double AND win MVP before the 2016-17 season  He predicted the Warriors going 73-9"
Russell Westbrook won an MVP
"The Heat are Pat Riley.  He is the soul of the team. Pat Riley believes in hard work. Pat Riley does not believe in excuses. Pat Riley fucking hates losing, and he hates people that are okay with losing. Winning is the only thing that matters.  He expects his players to give 100% night in and night out.  And he expects his players to step up when their number is called.    No player on that roster embodies Pat Riley's philosophy more than Jimmy Butler.  It's like he was born to play for Miami. And while Bam has been outscoring him and is the best player on the team right now, this cinderella run never gets off the ground without Jimmy.  Call me crazy, but if you replace Jimmy with Paul George or Gordon Hayward or even James Harden, I don't think this team makes the Finals. I don't think those players could have gotten this team to buy into the Heat philosophy in the way that they so clearly have. Jimmy checks his ego at the door, and everyone else on that team has followed suit.  Could you imagine 2017 Russell Westbrook or James Harden taking a back seat to Bam Adebayo to close out this game?  Hell no."

"Supposedly Russell Westbrook was accepted to Stanford solely on Academic Merit, so maybe him?"
I don't know if I am surprised that russell westbrook has the record for most 3 pointers attempted in a playoff game with 19.
Source?  I only found this and the players voted Westbrook as one the most overrated players.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2830169-anonymous-nba-players-vote-draymond-green-russell-westbrook-as-most-overrated.amp.html
"Billy Donovan, Chris Paul, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, everybody in Utah taking notes on how to close out a team: ""Have Lebron James on our team."""
"&gt;people could see why he would leave because the organization couldn't control Russ  For the one thousandth time, KD did not leave because of Russell Westbrook."
"I would take almost any good player with good basketball IQ, and composure over Russell Westbrook."
"&gt;The 2017 Houston Rockets, who eliminated MVP Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder before losing in the second round to San Antonio.   Wasn't on Reddit for this so curious, did Russ get shit on for losing in the first round or did everyone acknowledge his team was ass?"
It’s funny how one quote from Russell Westbrook has done more for Bev’s perception among fans than his 3 All Defence team selections.
"Playoff Lebron is the most satisfying thing in sports.  Billy donovan, chris Paul, james harden, russell westbrook, everybody in utah - i hope you took notes on how to close out a team.  As for the nuggets, I became a huge jamal murray fan this postseason.  The nuggets in general have a ton of young talent and the trio of murray, jokic and mpj might be a powerhouse in the coming years IF jokic actually gets in shape.  Kid has all the skill and heart, but could be an unstoppable beast if he actually hit the weights and built up his body to match his skill level.  Murray has arrived though.  All he needs is more consistency and the nuggets are set there."
"The worst type of NBA fan is the casual who tries to act like he knows what he’s talking about.   You can name all them other bullshit narratives about Russell Westbrook and it doesn’t change his resume. All that pretending a winning player doesn’t contribute to winning doesn’t work on this discussion.   Dennis fucking Johnson. Please shut the fuck up. This isn’t about who you want on your team. De gave accolades, awards, statistics to determine longevity and legacy. Ignoring that for Westbrook yet explaining zero context to older players YOU NEVER WATCHED is beyond idiotic. Keep your agendas out of legacy discussions"

"AD can get close to that list if they win this year. no one is saying he's not great. but he didn't do what McHale did in his career. you have to judge people based on the time they played. like yeah, no shit Russell Westbrook would have gone nuts in the sixties, but that doesn't make him better than Jerry West. paul pierce 100% is better than Melp. I'm not even the Ringzz Erneh guy, but there's zero chance PG is above any of those people you listed. TMac could go higher because he WAS a top five player when he was healthy, but he wasn't healthy long enough to achieve anything of more, which takes off points."
"Just like they were gonna have Demar Derozan , Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love , Paul George , and Boogie Cousins? Lakers were not an attractive free agents destination at all."
JVG is like the Russell Westbrook of commentators. You either have a thread where you get downvoted to oblivion for liking him or downvoted to oblivion for not liking him
"I don’t think people understand how much racist crap they deal with from fans too. Insecure, drunk people at the game and jealous of successful, athletic, driven, hard-working, tall black men and say racist crap to them to bring them down a level. I’m sure they ignore pretty much all of it and heard a lot of bs like that, given how much composure all the NBA players had during the Donald Sterling racist bullshit tapes that came out.   I also remember that shit with Russell Westbrook that happened a few years ago. Dude was MVP posting triple doubles, and this drunk mf said incredibly racist bullshit to him from the stands. And I know for every time someone reacts like Westbrook, there are lots of other incidents like that that players just brush off.   My guess is that NBA players hear racist bullshit more than most people. I 100% support what they’re doing in supporting BLM and everyone who doesn’t is a straight up bum. You don’t support BLM, you don’t support 70-80% of the NBA players you grew up admiring who have made your life better today.   And not support the Black Lives Matter movement today is a good sign that you wouldn’t have supported the Civil Rights protests in the 1950’s and 1960’s under Martin Luther King or 1850’s and 1860’s abolitionist movement. In all three cases, roughly the same percentage of Americans were against either movement (40% against, 45-55% support).   MLK was treated to same arguments BLM is treated now. LeBron and the other NBA players are hero for standing up for EVERYONE’s rights. LeBron James is a better role model than Donald Trump. If you can’t choose between LeBron and the dude that’s going down in history as the personification of a white racist backlash to the first African American president in a country with our 400 year history of race relations, then you got some issues with your moral character that I’d recommend you’d sort out"
"Remember that Bobby Webster did set up a deal for Paul George and Russell Westbrook to come to Toronto, but Masai vetoed it because he didn't want to blow the championship team up just for Kawhi. In hindsight, it was indeed a very good move."
&gt; they're better in that sense.  In the sense of them being better? What the fuck does this even mean. The better team won and that's all there is to it.  &gt; But Clippers lost the series more than the Nuggets won it.  In the immortal words of Russell Westbrook: [What!? Bro what are you talking about man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMDiy8g3HDs)
"Ah yes, so Russell Westbrook in his triple double season was not a superstar. Cool."
"I wonder if we might see a Thunder dynasty upcoming. Between this trade and trading Russell Westbrook the Thunder have a literal ton of 1st round picks over the 2020s. If the Thunder make the right moves they should be a perinnel championship contender starting around 2024. This is how the Tory Aikman Dallas Cowboys were formed, it all started because of the lopsided Herschel Walker trade that gave the Cowboys a load of picks."
You gotta use the full name. It’s Russell “You Better Double Me Because I’m Not a Good Enough Passer to Punish You for It” Westbrook.
"Nah, that shit is overblown. The only one I can think of would be Russell Westbrook if he was capable of understanding that he is a terrible fucking shooter. Cutting out those terrible pull-up long twos and threes would have done wonders for him over the years."
"Off the dome:  Fresh off his first title, high expectations to repeat now that the superteam Heat has been proven to be legit.  Entered the playoffs with the best record in basketball, including 27 game winstreak which was at the time the 2nd longest of all time. LeBron wins his 4th MVP in what is considered by many to be him at his best.  They ran through the Bucks and Bulls in 9 total games the first 2 rounds, but Dwyane Wade was only matching a fraction of his RS production and reaggrivated a knee injury stemming from his college days. Russell Westbrook went down R1 and the Thunder were upset by the grindhouse Grizz. The stage was being set for LeBron vs Duncan, Pop, &amp; crew rematch of 07.  The Heat are taken to 7 by the Pacers, with Dwyane Wade really struggling overall but still showing up in some big moments. The Heat look beatable for the first time all season, with the Pacers showing a recipe with dominating the paint against the smallest team in the league. The Spurs sweep the Grizzlies, having only lost 2 games all PS.  Keep in mind, ESPN's FIRSTTAKE with Stephen A Smith and Skip Bayless had really become one of, if not the, most popular shows for NBA coverage. And Skip was making a living off downplaying the Heat/LeBron's success. Come playoff time he was very high on ""his Spurs"" saying:  * that they would have, and should have, won the previous year had they not choked their 2-0 lead to OKC in the WCF. * He was saying that Pop and Duncan had a psychological edge over LeBron * That LeBron still hadn't proven he could perform when the lights were brightest since OKC shouldn't have beat SAS, who would have beaten MIA.  Game 1 was a tight one, ending with Tony Parker hitting a clutch shot at the buzzer. Spurs win.  Game 2 was a blowout. Heat win.  Game 3 was also a blowout. Spurs win.  Game 4 was also also a blowout. Heat win.  Game 5 was also not the closest game, with the Spurs jumping to a big lead in the 1st and not really relinquishing it. Spurs Win. Oh also, Danny Green has hit 25 3s already and looks like the favorite for Finals MVP. Skip Bayless brings up his classic, ""The chosen one has become the frozen one"" line covering the series.  Game 6, the Heat were down like 18 in the 4th and looks like the Spurs are going to win. LeBron leads a spirited comeback, losing his headband at one point and not putting it on the remainder of the game. Ray Allen hits his famous shot to force overtime, and the Heat win in extra time. Skip Bayless is talking about how Ray Allen saved LeBron's legacy, but the SAS would win in 7.  Game 7 was just a great game to watch, highly recommend going back and doing so if you haven't. It was close the whole game, LeBron hit 5 3s or something in the first half, he and Timmy were going at it, LeBron hit a dagger to seal the championship. *“I ain’t got no worries!”*  It was basically a f#$% you to Skip Bayless and NBA media in general doubting that he could repeat."

Russell Westbrook finally makes it into the finals thanks to Van Gundy
"Van gundy, can we talk about this fucking game, not Russell Westbrook."
&gt;He hasn't had a triple-double in this series so far. I think this is a good time to have one of those signature performances  My God Russell Westbrook really ruined what a signature game is   LeBron was fucking INCREDIBLE in G5
"medium-sized point guards with games based on athleticism with subpar shooting tend to be capped in terms of potential. Ja fits the John Wall, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook mold of athletic 1s who can reach top 10 player status but don't really exceed that. Don't get me wrong, Ja is incredible, but as a guard, he's gonna be hunted for mismatches his whole career come playoff time and if his shooting doesn't take several large steps forward, he'll be hard-capped in terms of how far he can rise."
are you still a russell westbrook fan?
Notice who’s not on here? Russell Westbrook
"Absolutely. Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Rudy Gobert, and Paul George are all undoubtedly top 20-ish players in the league who are CONSTANTLY hated on. I haven't heard anyone say anything at all positive about Paul George in about a month"
"Daily reminder Houston traded picks, a better trade asset, and an upgrade at point guard for Russell Westbrook."
People don't realize how much better Chris Paul was than Russell Westbrook
"I've been to 5 Laker games this year. Best ones were in the middle of the 100 section. I've yelled at AD to get up and run back on defense after he tried to flop on a jump shot and allowed Russell Westbrook to grab the rebound and then go coast to coast for a dunk.   Do you think if you talked to AD in real life, he'd say yeah, it's ok for me to lay on the floor. No biggie. You think he doesn't know to run back on D?"
"&gt; The teams in the finals that Jordan faced to me were never that impressive to me especially due to the talent that was on the bulls including the coaching stuff (probably the best coach of all time) . Not once did he play a team that had more then 2 all stars. Mj was apart of a dynasty that played against teams with two or fewer all stars.  The 91-93 Bulls were in no way a stacked roster. And had less talent from top to bottom than the 91 Lakers and 93 Suns. So you're really wrong there and have no idea what you're talking about.   &gt; People always say Jordan the goat because he’s 6-6 well if you took lebron of the 2007 cavs and put Jordan would he even bring them to the finals and if he does he would definitely loose.  Considering all 4 of those loses were decided by like 4-6 points max. And LeBron had shooting splits that would make Russell Westbrook look like Larry Bird. I would say pretty definitively MJ would win that 2007 series for the Cavs if he played up to his usual standards. Might have been a sweep the other way.  &gt; What about if you took lebron off the cavs in 2017 and 2018 is Jordan going to beat the best team in the history of the nba with the talent on the cavs no way in hell he beats them.  The 2017 Cavs with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love are one of the best offensive teams of all time. They went 12-1 in the playoffs before the finals and it's a better roster than all of MJs teams outside of 96. I would probably still lean towards the Warriors in this series but that Cavs team was absolutely stacked.   &gt; Lebron has won way more with less talent taking a trash team in 2007 to the finals and 2018 while Jordan is 1-9 without Scottie.   It's literally an objective fact that LeBron has won less. MJ has 6 championships, LeBron has 3. LeBron isn't 6-6 in the finals. It's not even about the undefeated record as much as 6 rings as the #1 guy like MJ.   Also that ""1-9"" in the playoffs LeBron doesn't even get a number for. Because he missed the playoffs his first 2 seasons. If making the finals regardless of the outcome is worth celebrating for LeBron, how is missing the playoffs better than making it and losing to better teams.    Also another fun fact you can't argue. MJ was never upset in the playoffs. Not once did MJs teams lose as the higher seed or with homecourt advantage. LeBron has 2009, 2010, &amp; 2011. Yikes."
"I will try one or two for every team. Some of these are far-fetched and depend either on title or spending most of their careers with one team.

Jesus imagine Lue’s wtf mouth agape expression coaching Russell Westbrook.
Kevin Love was college roommates with Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook according to the rockets.
"And also KD spent how many years in the muck that is/was OKC with Russell Westbrook. He came to play an enjoyable style of team basketball and in the process became a much better defender under the tutelage of Ron Adams as well as boost his knowledge of the local cutting edge Silicon Valley scene and therefore increased his investment portfolio. So if you look at the big picture, he gained quite a bit more than just 2 rings. He also could have went to Boston for more money, and they certainly would have been title favorites as well."
Did Lebron have an MVP level teammate on the Cavs? Or am I to infer that Mo Williams was as good as Russell Westbrook?
"&gt;Danny missing a three isn't nearly as bad as whatever the fuck Morris did immediately after. Like that brick was still horrendous, but it pales in comparison to Markieff's turnover.  Bro if he makes it, Morris doesn't get the ball. Both were hot garbage but one doesn't happen without the other.   Plus Daniels shooting has been horrendous the whole season, not just 1 play. Sure you can point at his stats but they don't paint the whole picture, he gets the most open shots in the NBA. The only people more open than him are people like Russell Westbrook, Rondo, Ben Simmons, Giannis, etc."
It's interesting you watch how AD guards Jimmy Butler it's not like how he or other bigs guarded Russell Westbrook this year they are up closer on him. Partly due to the unpredictability of how Butler will attack you and how he's more methodical despite how Butler's jumper has been. Westbrook you knew more what's coming he's gonna bulid up steam and momentum and you have to be ready.
Exactly. Kobe scored his monster point games when the Lakers weren't very good. He carried them. Russell Westbrook pads his stats to the detriment of the team. I often wonder if Lebron had played with Phil if Lebron would have more titles but less impressive stats.   I also don't think it can be overlooked that Lebron played in the worst conference during its worst stretch in league history. Lebrons teams in the West do NOT reach that many championships in a row.
"I'm not denying that. It's not some terrible thing to be sensitive, I don't see the reason to be in full on denial mode. It's just not even a question that Russell Westbrook is literally, by the definition of the word, more sensitive than most other stars. The talk *clearly* affects him, and that's just part of his identity."
*sips chocolate milk and snipes Russell Westbrook with a nerf dart from the top of a scaffolding*
"He was a great story his MVP season and would have been a Russell Westbrook that actually wins playoff series, but he stole that MVP from Bron lmao"
He was basically Russell Westbrook without dumb shot selection.
1. Zeke 2. CP3 3. Stockton 4. Gary Payton 5. Steve Nash 6. Jason Kidd 7. Russell Westbrook
Why is Russell Westbrook still in the League? Apparently he is the worst starting PG in the League
"Some of the posts are genuinely takes from Reddit it’s so damn hilarious. “That’s so admirable, Lakers in 4.” And shit like “jimmy serving me up Russell Westbrook down by 10” lmao."
I remember Kobe saying OKC was going to be a problem with KD and Westbrook and I think they had Harden at the time.   I hope Russell finds a good team that can utilize all his talents and maximize his potential.
Even on his burners he was constantly praising Westbrook. He was shit talking everyone else and saying the only people they had was him and Russell the Muscle.
Russell Westbrook
Getting told I'm wrong by a Russell Westbrook fan... hahahahahahahaha
"I think you grade based on what they did in their era. honestly I don't think Bill and Wilt are even close anymore. everyone from their era said Bill was the better player if you wanted to win games. he was unselfish, athletic as fuck, the most dominant defensive presence (in comparison to their peers) of all time, and dominated in transition. wilt was too selfish. I used to think he was underrated but the more I learn about basketball, the less I value what he did.   it's like comparing westbrook and Steph curry. 40 years from now some kids gonna see Westbrooks stats and think he was clearly better than steph when everyone who's watched the game present day knows better. it's not his fault he was born in the 1934 instead of the 70s or 80s, you know? honestly I think Russell has an argument for being much higher on the list. so does Duncan to be honest."
"As in Bill Russell? It was a different time, big men dominated. He would be called a ""paint beast"" today, and wouldn't dominate like he did then. It's like comparing Babe Ruth to Griffey Jr.  Jordan learned how things were in his era and adapted and became unstoppable. That ""killer"" mentality that everyone praises players for (Kobe, DWade, Westbrook, etc), where did they learn that from?  I will give you that Bron is different. He's been exceeding expectations for forever and his game is a, albeit slower, mix of Magic and Jordan. Perfect player right? But he still needs the right pieces around him to win.  Jordan was so much more than just a scorer, he looked like, at times, that he was playing chess when everyone else was playing checkers. In EVERY aspect of the game.  6-0 isn't the argument, it should've been 8-0 at least. But its proof he's the GOAT"

imagine bringing up russell westbrook in a discussion about jordan and lebron
Imagine complaining that Russell Westbrook doesn’t receive enough criticism.
"What about Morey? He took the Rockets from a  title contender to a team built around a Russell Westbrook that would get picked last at the YMCA, and Jeff Green. Is there a trashcan award or something that he and Elton Brand can share?"
"2001 Allen Iverson (should have gone to Shaq, but Shaq wasn't getting an MVP playing alongside Kobe, another MVP candidate)  2005 Steve Nash, 16 &amp; 12 will always be some of the weakest raw numbers from an MVP. It was arguable that Amar'e was Phoenix' best player too. Nash IMO was much better in 2006 and 2007.   2011 Derrick Rose. He was an incredible player to watch, but largely has inflated stats due to being the only offensive option on a team that was a well oiled defensive machine. Should have gone to LeBron, Dwight or hot take Dirk (who averaged 23/7/3 on 50/40/90 and Dallas was a 64 win pace team in games he played).   2017 Russell Westbrook. I'll admit I was a huge fan, that year was so fun and vindicating to see Russell leading OKC after Durant left. WB was still great that year, but one of the weaker MVP seasons  2019 Giannis. Not quite as dominant as his 2020 season, Very unpolished game."
"Joe Johnson is one of the most overrated ""all stars"" of the 2000s. If he's in the West he has 2 all star appearances tops.   No way he is getting 7 all star nods over Kobe, Nash, Chris Paul, Deron Williams, Tony Parker/Manu Ginobili, Ray Allen, Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook, Tracy McGrady, Brandon Roy, Chauncey Billups, Shawn Marion etc...   Johnson made all star games while averaging 16/3/3, 18/4/4 (on 44/29/80 shooting), 19/3/4, and then multiple years while averaging 21 ppg despite being the #1 option on mediocre teams and playing 40 MPG."
"Your assessment of both players is wrong. Monta Ellis was the engine of one of the most efficient offenses ever (at the time) for the Mavericks, before the Rondo trade tanked their O and scuttled their chances at making any noise in the playoffs. Russell Westbrook has made the finals once and conference finals multiple times as the second best player on a team."
Ya one got the job done while the other stat pads nothing much  Russell Westbrook used to have good stats too
"&gt;Curry can’t drive like Harden  [False](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/2/12/18221183/steph-curry-warriors-2019-all-star-game-charlotte). I’m sure Harden could also play off-ball like Steph, but yeah maybe his shooting percentages wouldn’t be as high. From the article I linked:  &gt; A component of Curry’s success is his supporting cast: Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant constantly attract defensive attention, which opens gaps for Curry’s drives from beyond the 3-point line to the basket. **Even in 2013-14, his first season as an All-Star, he scored 1.1 points per drive, which is a number that Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, and Kemba Walker have hit zero times since that season. Since ’13-14, Curry is just one of five players—along with Durant, LeBron James, James Harden, and Kawhi Leonard—who has scored 1.2 points per drive more than once. Curry is about as lethal scoring at the rim as he is launching from the logo.**"
"https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1=westbru01&amp;p1yrfrom=2009&amp;p1yrto=2020&amp;player_id2_hint=Damian+Lillard&amp;player_id2_select=Damian+Lillard&amp;player_id2=lillada01&amp;p2yrfrom=2013&amp;p2yrto=2020  I'm not saying Westbrook doesnt have more accolades. dames advanced stats are better both per game and in their first right seasons in the league. four years from now would be the right time to compare their careers since Dames played four less years. that said, thanks for participating in a dialogue about it.   I loved Grant in that team. when LaMarcus was dropping 56 on steven adams head it was Jerami Grant who was impressing me the most in the thunder. also obviously this year and lastwould demonstrate that Dame had an MVP caliber ceiling. appreciate the conversation, throughout!"
"No, Westbrook is not better than Chris Paul. He has a better resume while also having a MVP caliber prime with elite longevity.   Oladipo was the same player in OKC that he was in Orlando, in fact he was slightly even better. He credits Westbrook for teaching him what it takes to be a star, and being traded again fueled him to change his whole body.  Sabonis was a rookie that Donavon had playing on the perimeter as a shooter. I see why you don’t mention a player like Grant though.   MVP Westbrook literally trumps Dames best season in both box scores and advanced analytics/impact stats. Points, rebounds, assists, WS, on off, VORP, RAPTOR, PIPM, BPM, etc etc. In those playoffs, the Thunder were outscored by 62 points while he was on the bench. They literally won against the Houston Rockets when he was actually playing.   Westbrook’s the only MVP season that has the combination of both unreal numbers, advanced analytics, that still gets thought of as “not a winning player.”   Bill Russell won rings. Dame has not and hasn’t even gotten as far as Russ on any team."
"As a number one, who got further in the playoffs? Damian lillard got to the western conference finals as a number one. I'm not even a westbrook hater lol I just don't think he's better than Damian Lillard the last five years. And are you saying Westbrook is better than Chris Paul? Oladopo couldn't get better? sabonis couldn't get better? I've gotten no actual argument against what I've said. I'm just eating downvotes and being told I'm spamming anti westbrook narratives. Guess wilt chamberlain a better than bill russell, right? He had the bigger numbers so that makes him better I guess."

[The Knicks are currently trying to low ball the Rockets after Woj came out and said Westbrook's trade market is slow developing. ](https://nypost.com/2020/11/13/russell-westbrook-trade-rumors-knicks-only-want-star-at-discount/) I can't wait see how you lolknicks people spin this to clown NYK.
Russell Westbrook on the Knicks next season
My money's on:  - Gordon Hayward + 1/2 first round picks for Myles Turner - Russell Westbrook for literally anything they can pry from the Knicks - Jrue Holiday gets sent to Brooklyn
"Prime Russell Westbrook. Because I don’t know the other 4 players, and him and CP3 are the best I’ve seen as pgs for dragging bad teams to high levels."
"And Russell Westbrook was a KD injury, an Ibaka injury, or an injury to himself away from winning a championship from 2012-2014. In reality, nobody’s play style is really THAT detrimental"
"I'm kind of a Westbrook critic overall but I think it would be a good move for the Knicks.  They are probably not going to draft and build around a championship core in the next three years, and Russell Westbrook will bring excitement and entertainment to New York.    Plus I think his defiant attitude would really click with the fanbase and they'd have fun rooting for him."
"Houston has to get equal value, that's how (most) trade work, I don't think Russ is a negative asset, and I don't see the problem with trading guys like Knox, DSJ and first roundt draft picks for 3 years or Russell westbrook, they probably won't amount to much anyways."
"So you're saying that they'll trade Curry and the 2# for Russell Westbrook, Klay will GTFO there as quickly as possible in a trade and they'll bring Semaj Christon from overseas to be the SG. Westbrook will lead the team to an 8th seed with a 40 point triple double on Lamelo shooting percentages and win the MVP because of narrative. Then he'll get beaten in the first round. Kerr bails out of GS and they hire Brett Brown."
"When Harden made these comments the Rockets were struggling with injuries and Chris Paul was having a down year. I think that is what Harden was really talking about. I doubt he necessarily minds being an iso player, getting to dictate the offense. What I think he minded was that he didn't have another guy next to him that was capable that year. Those are different problems. He plays the same way with Russ or Paul next to him, it is just that there is someone else to do it when he sits or when he wants a break.  He wanted to trade for Russell Westbrook, I think that fits in with what I'm saying here. He doesn't want to diversify his game, he just does not want to be the only high usage perimeter creator."
Maybe I’m in the minority but I’d love a Russell Westbrook and Gordon Hayward tandem. They may both get hurt for the year or just be average as a team but it sounds kinda fun.
I hear Russell Westbrook is available
 Lakers - Magic  Bulls - Jordan  Spurs - Duncan  Mavs - Dirk  Warriors - Wilt  OKC - Westbrook  Houston - Hakeem  Wolves - Garnett  Pistons - Thomas  Raptors - Vince  Jazz - Malone  Sixers - Dr. J  Boston - Russell  Clippers - Blake  Knicks - Willis Reed  Kings - Webber  Hawks - Nique  Nets - Kidd  Hornets - Larry Johnson  Pelicans - AD  Cavs - Lebron  Pacers - Reggie  Bucks - Kareem  Miami - Wade  Magic - Howard  Wizards - Wes Unseld  Nuggets - Alex English  Blazers - Walton  Grizz - Z Bo (Gasol was better but grizz fans will go Z bo every time so got to listen to em)  Suns - Barkley
"So the Knicks lineup will be Russell Westbrook, RJ Barrett, Gordon Hayward,..............., Mitchell Robinson   Fuck it. Trade for Kevin Love too 😂🤦‍♂️"
Russell Westbrook and a first to Charlotte  Kevin Love and a first to Charlotte
"At his price, with the milage on his body, and play style?  He's pretty much a negative in most all realistic situations.  This was a nice read.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/11/12/21562885/russell-westbrook-trade-rumors-rockets"
"&gt; The raptors had a chance to trade for Paul George and Russell Westbrook to keep Kawhi and Masai chose not to  wait, is this true"
"&gt; I understand analytics and the value they bring  Not trying to be a jerk, but if you believe that having Russell Westbrook is preferable to having $41M in cap space you fundamentally don't understand analytics."
It's Russell Westbrook. You'd have to think GMs know what he is and what he isn't. If KD got a max after his injury then I think GMs would be okay trading for Westbrook after a bad playoff run.
"The raptors had a chance to trade for Paul George and Russell Westbrook to keep Kawhi and Masai chose not to, what makes you think he’d trade for Westbrook now?"
"At least danny green tricks other teams to guard him. Demar gets the russell Westbrook treatment.   Demar isnt a team player. He went on JJs podcast recently and said that since hes ""proven"" he can shoot 3s in his last season in toronto, he doesnt need to shoot them anymore. Put that in with his non existent effort on defense and we just see a selfish player who only wants to do what's best for him.   I really doubt that 12 fga will sit well with him."
Paul George had some bad moments... but a 6'7 versatile wing is much more valuable than Russell Westbrook.
"Russell ""46% TS the last 2 playoffs"" Westbrook"
"Because Russell Westbrook isn't the same old Westbrook he wants to be the man and be the leader yet he's declining with an albatross of a contract.   We're supposed to prioritize RJ's development whom if we surround with shooters should make it easy for him to work in the paint. Russ is **NOT** a shooter, he shot 24% from 3 this year and his BBIQ and passing vision are overstated.  Playoff experience for what? a 1st round exit with literally 0 cap space to sign anyone? We have to pay mitch, rj, frank with our cap or did you forget?   IT is wasting cap space because we can sign guys like FVV or Wood who'd be bridge pieces if anything for us to get wins. Russ is 32 he'll be 35 at the end of his contract why in the hell would you sacrifice your cap space for the 8th fucking seed at BEST."
Paul George is better than Russell Westbrook? Uh ok... We're back on the Westbrook is severely underrated...
"This is like the easiest way to get Kawhi to opt out next off-season, lol, bring in Russell Westbrook, Team Obliterator during Kawhi's opt out year."
If you think the rockets are gonna trade russell Westbrook for fucking Julius randle and 1 pick you don’t know shit about basketball
"Could you imagine trading Gallo, SGA, 5 FRPs and 2 Pick Swaps for ultimately a package of Russell Westbrook and RoCo?  That might be the worst progression of assets I have ever seen."
"I mean that or having a good player can help attract a star. I think one of the big reasons the Knicks can't get anyone to sign there is because they literally don't have a player who has done anything notable in their career except be a role player or average to below average starter. The other players are ""promising"" sure but that doesn't mean shit if the coaching is garbage meaning there's a good chance that talent won't develop. With a player who is already established themselves as a good player (like Kevin Love), a team can not only have a good player to set an example for the younger guys but also they might be able to attract some better mid level starters. That's why you see teams like Charlotte offering to take a player like Russell Westbrook. People think it's easy to just become a team like the Sixers, where you get stars through the draft, but they miss two key details,   1. Brett Brown is an average to even possibly above average coach (at his best, but again at the Sixers current state he is not what we need) which is something teams like the Knicks and Bulls have not had, so it matters much less of wether they have young talent because shit coaching won't really do anything for them. In Embiid and Simmons' first year playing together, they already had Covington and Saric, who were both good relatively young starters who had been well-coached by Brett Brown (they also had signed JJ Redick to a one year deal as well, as signing another above average starter was also key)  2. It is effectively much harder to do what the Sixers did, because they changed the draft odds to punish teams that go all in on being bad (or essentially equalize the draft odds among bad teams to encourage them to still put their best players on the floor)"
"Poor Oscar never gets his due:  Robertson is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history, a triple threat who could score inside, outside and also was a stellar playmaker. His rookie scoring average of 30.5 points per game is the third highest of any rookie in NBA history, and Robertson averaged more than 30 points per game in six of his first seven seasons.[1] Only three other players in the NBA have had more 30+ point per game seasons in their career. Robertson was the first player to average more than 10 assists per game, doing so at a time when the criteria for assists were more stringent than today.[2] Furthermore, Robertson is the first guard in NBA history to ever average more than 10 rebounds per game, doing so three times. It was a feat that would not be repeated until Russell Westbrook managed to achieve it during the 2016–17 season. In addition to his 1964 regular season MVP award, Robertson won three All-Star Game MVPs in his career (in 1961, 1964, and 1969). He ended his career with 26,710 points (25.7 per game, ninth-highest all time), 9,887 assists (9.5 per game) and 7,804 rebounds (7.5 per game).[1] He led the league in assists six times, and at the time of his retirement, he was the NBA's all-time leader in career assists and free throws made, and was the second all-time leading scorer behind Wilt Chamberlain.[2]  Robertson also set yardsticks in versatility. If his first five NBA seasons are strung together, Robertson averaged a triple-double over those, averaging 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists.[34] For his career, Robertson had 181 triple-doubles, a record that has never been approached.[35] These numbers are even more astonishing if it is taken into account that the three-point shot, which benefits sharpshooting backcourt players, did not exist when he played. In 1967–68, Robertson also became the first of only two players in NBA history to lead the league in both scoring average and assists per game in the same season (also achieved by Nate Archibald). The official scoring and assist titles went to other players that season, however, because the NBA based the titles on point and assist totals (not averages) prior to the 1969–70 season. Robertson did, however, win a total of six NBA assist titles during his career. For his career, Robertson shot a high .485 field goal average and led the league in free-throw percentage twice—in the 1963–64 and 1967–68 seasons.[1]"
Has someone said John Wall? Russell Westbrook might be the worst upcoming here.
"Russell""You better double me"" Westbrook vs Wayoff P"
"I think you mean he accomplished more, and I agree with that.  But in no way does KD mean more to OKC than Russell Westbrook. In no way."
Except the little part where Russell Westbrook can't play with a center unless that center can bomb threes at a high clip.
Perfect. I cant think of a more appropriate uniform for Russell Westbrook to fade into obscurity in.
Portland ain't doing it.  Cleveland maybe.  Sacramento is gonna be vetoed by the very Russell Westbrook.  Indiana is gonna fall short.   I hope Russ goes to Cleveland.
I read this as “the murder hornets’ and wondered what Russell Westbrook did to deserve a murder hornet bride. Ooof! Time for bed.
&gt;we do NOT want Russell Westbrook or Chris Paul atm.   Does we include James Dolan?
This coming season I decided to be a Hornets Stan but I really dislike Russell Westbrook
"He can throw passes, but he's not the kind of player you get to orchestrate an offense around multiple players who are better than he is offensively. He works best when he's the center of the offense and everyone just plays off of him when he can't get a shot for himself, but I don't see that being the best option for the Clippers. As someone who roots against the Clippers and who thinks that Russell Westbrook is death to championship level basketball though, I really hope the Clippers get him so he can do to them what he did to the Rockets this year."
Happy has 5 letters in it.   Russell Westbrook's number is 0.   05  Birthday has 8 letters in it. 8-5 = 3  305  Westbrook to Miami confirmed.
"&gt; I don’t see what I’m missing here  The playoffs. You're missing the playoffs.   Since Russell Westbrook has entered the league, your team has missed the playoffs 9 times out of 11 seasons. In the weakest conference.  I can't imagine why fans of perennial lottery pick teams or decade long playoff drought teams (especially ones in the weakest conferences of the league) would ever devalue a former MVP who is a guaranteed playoff appearance in the Western Conference for 10 years straight (minus an injury year) during it's most competitive period in NBA history."
Micheal Jordan has said before that Westbrook reminds him of his younger self:  [https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-jordan-says-russell-westbrook-reminds-him-of-his-younger-self/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-jordan-says-russell-westbrook-reminds-him-of-his-younger-self/)  Jordan would love to have Westbrook be his feature player.   I guess this means the end of Rozier and probably Graham's Charlotte tenure though.
Russell Westbrook must’ve gotten tired of competing.
"Hmmm I do agree with you actually. As far as hall of fame goes, I still do think Russell Westbrook will get into the hall of fame simply based off reputation"
If Russell Westbrook ends up a Keep Gettin' Dem Cheques guy within the next few weeks it will make me feel mega old.   Feels like only yesterday it was the 'Mom Made Pizza Rolls!' memes. They grow up so fast.
"The league has certainly adopted more Morey ball, but it’s overstating things to say every team is just doing threes and layups. As a whole, the league is taking more threes, but there’s still diversity in how teams play. The Rockets and Nets don’t take many midrange attempts, but teams like the Warriors and Spurs still get up their fair share. Some of those teams will also take those outside the restricted area shots the Rockets have generally avoided too.   There are still quality midrange shooters who have come into the league since Westbrook. I think you’re just not really thinking here. There’s even another Russell in the league that takes them. D’Lo, CJ, Middleton, DeMar, Booker, Kyrie, Mitchell, Murray. There’s other guys who don’t take a ton, but do take them are efficient. There are plenty of guys who’ve come in since Westbrook was drafted that are better midrange shooters than he was. Some of these guys are even fairly recent picks. I think you’re getting too caught up in a theme and losing some of the facts. Certainly to only think of Wiggins as the representative of the midrange game is a mistake."
I really don’t like Russell Westbrook
"When Russell Westbrook said he wanted out, Michael Jordan took that personally."
Probably taken from [here](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rockets-trade-destinations-knicks-pistons-pelicans/)
I’m saying I’m not impressed by losers like Tracy McGrady and Russell Westbrook who do nothing but put up numbers and go home early every year.
"I don't see the analogue here. If an aging Russell Westbrook is what nets you Giannis, pardon the pun, then I will admit I was wrong on this one. And even then, that's an awkward fit and bad spacing.  Personally, I would rather have a cost controlled, high lottery pick in the hand than KD and Kyrie in the bush. And you'd have more cap space to sign free agents anyway without Russ' $40+ million salary."
"How long will this completely 100% wrong shit take exist?  Russell ""Triple Double"" Westbrook, who delivered PG13's best season ever by taking a back seat and playmaking for him, demands the ball too much, and kills momentum. Come on man"

Barret - MRobinson - Russell Westbrook soup or team  ill take the soup
"bro i know his contract is bad but this is Russell Westbrook, they aren’t gonna just offer Willy Hernangomez, Terry Rozier and a 2nd for a former MVP no matter what his reputation is now. He was still a top 5 PG last year, the Rockets aren’t dumping a 37 year old averaging 10MPG, WB might not even lead them to the playoffs but the Rockets are more than likely gonna get some young pieces and picks for him to rebuild around"
Because they don't watch the team play lol.  No fan who watches the hornets 60 times a year would scoff at adding russell westbrook right now.  He will give you a chance to watch meaningful basketball and will be exciting while doing it.
"Admittedly I forgot that he actually had covid...but it's an assumption to say that impacted his play at all. I had it (i'm obviously not an nba player, but think relative) and i had no issue after i recovered with cardio/strength. Kawhi won a championship with a bum quad that clearly hindered him btw. Obviously wasn't in the bubble, but greats get compared to greats.  Having Russell Westbrook taking deep jump shots is one of the last things I'd ever want for an offense, so you're right maybe he shouldn't have been playing. But if he can't figure out ways to score after resting up for what, 1-2 weeks, then that's an example of his limitations as a player. He should've taken on more of a facilitator role and *made his teammates better* in that case.  You seemingly want to avoid answering why most NBA teams don't want him."

I swear to god Kevin O'Connor masturbates to Russell Westbrook lowlights. Dude has such a personal vendetta
What part of Russell Westbrook can’t play with traditional bigs is hard for people to understand.  He has to play with all shooter otherwise he’s one of the easiest players to guard for a top 20 guy.  He’s basically smaller Ben Simmons with no defense and a worse attitude.p and higher usage.

Hey. Mitch. MJ. DON'T FUCKING END A PROMISING REBUILD FOR RUSSELL WESTBROOK YOU FUCKS
Bye Russell Westbrook
"Knicks vs Nets Christmas Day, 2020   &amp;#x200B;  Clock winds down to 5 seconds  Westbrook has 47 points on 20/70 shooting  Ball inbounded to Westbrook, who turns to face Durant  &amp;#x200B;  “You joined the team that beat us!”  \*fakes left\*  “You were my brother!”  \*fakes right\*  “We could have won it all – “  \*crossover\*  “ – together”  Clock down to 2 seconds  “New York – THIS IS FOR YOUUU”  &amp;#x200B;  The ball flies over Durant’s head, straight into the basket.

"Even though it looks bad now, these 3 managed to build a really, really good team for a couple of seasons. Building a legitimate contender in this era, with the amount of talent in the league is not easy task at all. I think that the downfall of the Rockets can't be put on a lack of accountability over Harden because he has been improving every year, even when it seems imposible to keep getting better. You can say that this hurts the locker room, but is really that the issue with the rockets when these last two playoffs they really seemed to lack the talent/starpower to compete with the warriors/lakers? Chris Paul looked well past his prime in 2019. Russell westbrook had an inconsistent year which ended with an abysmal playoffs performance. Sometimes it be like that, they gambled in aging stars because they didn't have the assets to get someone better and Houston is not a coveted destination by free agents. It failed, you move on."
I wouldn't want to hear criticism about being unselfish or a good teammate from Russell frickin' Westbrook either.
"Eric Bledsoe, Mini-LeBron  Russell Westbrook, Mini-Kawhi  We need more"
"Russell ""if I dont average a triple double, who am I?"" Westbrook"
"Robertson is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history, a triple threat who could score inside, outside and also was a stellar playmaker. His rookie scoring average of 30.5 points per game is the third highest of any rookie in NBA history, and Robertson averaged more than 30 points per game in six of his first seven seasons.[1] Only three other players in the NBA have had more 30+ point per game seasons in their career. Robertson was the first player to average more than 10 assists per game, doing so at a time when the criteria for assists were more stringent than today.[2] Furthermore, Robertson is the first guard in NBA history to ever average more than 10 rebounds per game, doing so three times. It was a feat that would not be repeated until Russell Westbrook managed to achieve it during the 2016–17 season. In addition to his 1964 regular season MVP award, Robertson won three All-Star Game MVPs in his career (in 1961, 1964, and 1969). He ended his career with 26,710 points (25.7 per game, ninth-highest all time), 9,887 assists (9.5 per game) and 7,804 rebounds (7.5 per game).[1] He led the league in assists six times, and at the time of his retirement, he was the NBA's all-time leader in career assists and free throws made, and was the second all-time leading scorer behind Wilt Chamberlain.[2]  Robertson also set yardsticks in versatility. If his first five NBA seasons are strung together, Robertson averaged a triple-double over those, averaging 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists.[34] For his career, Robertson had 181 triple-doubles, a record that has never been approached.[35] These numbers are even more astonishing if it is taken into account that the three-point shot, which benefits sharpshooting backcourt players, did not exist when he played. In 1967–68, Robertson also became the first of only two players in NBA history to lead the league in both scoring average and assists per game in the same season (also achieved by Nate Archibald). The official scoring and assist titles went to other players that season, however, because the NBA based the titles on point and assist totals (not averages) prior to the 1969–70 season. Robertson did, however, win a total of six NBA assist titles during his career. For his career, Robertson shot a high .485 field goal average and led the league in free-throw percentage twice—in the 1963–64 and 1967–68 seasons.[1]"
"clearly, the guy who lead the league in assists, Russell ""Triple Double"" Westbrook isn't a team player. The guy who literally every former team mate praised, who Austin Rivers declared his favorite team mate ever after only a couple of months on the team, is not a team player.  delete this shit and shut the fuck up before you embarrass yourself further"
"Russell Westbrook, the new mayor of:   Keep away from me with that fuck shit.  Population 2."
Yeah - a whole lot of people have tunnel vision with this game. I just fucking love the game of basketball and appreciate those that can do what most cannot... who can explode past John Wall or Lillard that easily?!  Russell Westbrook is like Christmas presents from grandma... they could be toys ... or they could be clothes! Regardless of the excitement or disappointment it’s still Christmas!
"https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/4/26/15431112/russell-westbrook-rockets-thunder-lineups-2017  if by better player you mean better cheerleader while on the bench, sure"
Ironically harden fans and Westbrook haters claimed Westbrook’s team in 16 sucked because Russell didn’t do enough to get them involved and he dominated the ball. Now it’s come full circle
Westbrook was never a locker room problem like CP3 and Dwight were what the hell. Lob City and the failed Lakers superteam come immediately to mind. It would take a long time to find a locker room problem that was directly caused by Russell Westbrook
"What context am I missing that makes giving up 2 picks and 2 pick swaps and Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook a net neutral to positive move? Was it the injury prone Chris Paul? Even if he was that same injury prone player that he was with you the year prior it still fits into what we were trying to do in the long haul- i.e., be bad.   All of the risk was on Houston's side of the deal. Again, I understand putting all of your chips in for a win-now move, but you did it for an obviously declining Russel Westbrook. And I say that as someone who has watched that decline for the last few years. He was getting worse. I knew it then, Sam Presti knew it then, and Morey if he's as smart as I think for sure knew it then. But the move was still made. And that move was and still is bad due to all of that and more that I've said the last few messages. It may not have *seemed* bad to you but the results are in and it *was*. Which should not have surprised you, man. I'm sorry."
"Houston wants out of the Russell Westbrook experiment, too."
"&gt;Wayne Ellington, Bobby Portis, Frank Ntilikina, Kevin Knox II and a 2021 second-round pick for Russell Westbrook  I would drive them to the airport myself."
Russell Westbrook is going to piss and moan every game and offseason no matter where he goes. Tbh i think playing side by side with oscar-nominated actress james harden suits him perfectly.
Russell Westbrook chased KD and PG13 away but y'all want to paint Harden as the bad guy because Westbrook is destroying yet another duo?
Russell Westbrook is gonna go to the Clippers
1. Chris Paul 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Carmelo Anthony 5. Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook, 2picks, and two swaps for Chris Paul"
Are you suggesting that no NBA team will want to sign Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook is probably the best floor raiser in the entire NBA but he is not going to get your team farther into the playoffs.
What team is Russell Westbrook propelling to a championship?
Russell Westbrook played a season on the rockets before his stint with the Charlotte hornets
All my homies hate Russell Westbrook
I see no agenda behind this conveniently timed post whatsoever but rather an innocent clip of Russell Westbrook playing basketball
75 % he's run off Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook not many star's get a chance to run of 1 a + plus player but 2 that's a you problem.  D Antoni scheme will always fail in the playoffs. Regular season it's awesome .
" &gt;Yeah Russell Westbrook has played with KD, Paul George, Melo, Ibaka, Harden, Steven Adams.  He also plays in the west. And he solo carried them to playoffs before Pg arrived. That team was Westbrook + Adam's. And Adam's was useless on offense without Westbrook. He wasn't very good even then. He was basically their to set picks.   Wall is in the east where seeds 6,7,8 had losing record lol... and still had a similar record to OkC   On a team with no spacing or other scoring. No bench either lol. That team as bottom of the West without him... people compare him to harden but harden's team was way better. At least in terms of construction. They also had a better coach.   Wall has beal who offensively is miles ahead of Wall. A legit allstar..   Otto was a million times better than Robertson.   Oladipo was on the team too but he was nowhere near his all star far from.  Was there best 3pt shooter."
Thank god I'm not the only one who was thinking this. The majority of the comments are acting like this is a lose-lose trade but I would 100% rather have John Wall on my team than Russell Westbrook.
D'angelo Russell Westbrook Lopez
This is a disaster. Stay away from Harden.  Harden couldn't play with Chris Paul or Dwight Howard or Ty Lawson or Russell Westbrook or Jeremy Lin.  Harden is a cancer.  .
"Black players don't want to play for Cuban and the Mavs either.   You will notice they have had an extremely hard time getting a star to join them there. They had to overpay for a fucking Harrison Barnes. And they when they finally got DJ, at it at his current cost when his value was less.  NO black star is even thinking of joining them. Cuban knows he has a problem with black stars - he fucked up in going after Russell Westbrook years back - and you can bet his very public approach to Delonte West is a way to curry favor.   But ain't nobody fucking with him."
Russell Westbrook is too fun for the Spurs /s

'Russell Westbrook on the Wizards' is hard to say quickly
"He may be a worse shooter, but he's a better overall player and a good scorer. Passing is debatable. John Wall has flashier passes, but I don't know that he's flat out a better passer.  Wall has had injury problems while Russell Westbrook has barely been injured. The Wizards have their time with Beal right now, and you can get a sure thing in terms of someone that can contribute and add value,. The alternative is you take a chance on someone who has had multiple serious injuries to come back and contribute at a high level and not get injured again.  Westbrook has been in deep playoff runs and will still dish out a lot of assists. Beal doesn't need the ball and it will allow Beal to start playing high level defense more again."
I’d like to see The Heat get Russell Westbrook instead. Jimmy and Russ are the two hardest working players in the league!
"Oh most definitely. He’s not John Wall or Russell Westbrook, but you can get a clear perspective when you compare him to someone like Kyrie."
Ugh I'll be that guy again. Paul George is not better than Russell Westbrook.
"Yeah Russell Westbrook has played with KD, Paul George, Melo, Ibaka, Harden, Steven Adams.  John Wall has played with Bradley Beal and Marcin Gortat.  It's a mystery why John Wall hasn't gotten as far as Westbrook."
"I mean so is Russell Westbrook, doesn’t mean he’s a great asset.  If you’re paying &gt;$35M for a 30 year old small guard with gimpy knees, and the guy tops out as the ~15-20th best guard in the NBA when healthy... it’s not that great of an asset."
"They playing 5D chess.   Step 1.) Trade for LeVert, Dinwiddie, Jarrett Allen and for every Nets the next 8 years  Step 2.) Trade Caris LeVert, Robet Covington, and Jarrett Allen to the Warriors for the #2 pick. Effectively giving them the same lineup they won a record number of games with except with Robert Covington instead of Harrison Barnes (an upgrade) and Caris LeVert instead of Livingston (also an upgrade)  Step 3.) Trade Russell Westbrook to the Clippers for Patrick Beverly, Lou Williams, and Shamet. This could potentially give the Clippers a primary ball handler to pair with George and Kawhi, which they desperately needed.  Step 4.) Trade Patrick Beverly, Lou Williams, PJ Tucker and Shamet to the 76ers for picks and Horford thereby providing them with shooting and cap relief.  Step 5.) Watch as the defending champ Lakers improve and Bucks get Jrue and Bogdanović.  Step 6.) Sit back and hope the Nets have so much competition that all they crazy personalities in that locker room implode and Durant, Harden, and Kyrie all demand trades away from Brooklyn"
Would Russell Westbrook really wanna play for Scott Brooks again?
"The Rockets and Wizards have discussed a deal centered on Russell Westbrook for John Wall, sources tell @TheAthleticNBA @Stadium. No traction yet, Rockets are seeking more assets."
please no. i don’t want to do the russell westbrook. it’d be a way worse song
Please no. The last thing I want the Wizards doing is giving up picks for Russell Westbrook.
Rockets Receive: John Wall #9 Pick  Wizards Receive: Russell Westbrook #16 Pick
I like how the Rockets are seeking more assets. I'd much rather have John Wall than Russell Westbrook
There's a whole article written about how Harden's style rubs his teammates the wrong way: https://theathletic.com/2193385/2020/11/11/russell-westbrook-wants-a-trade-and-thats-just-the-start-an-inside-look-at-the-rockets/
My train of thought as a Russell Westbrook fan is trade them both to contenders but don't break the league by sending Harden to Brooklyn for pennies
"Well, if we are just going to throw out crazy trade ideas here is my 3 teamer for the Rockets, Knicks, and Warriors: [https://tradenba.com/trades/nmJrppk9S](https://tradenba.com/trades/nmJrppk9S)   The Rockets get: Andrew Wiggins, Kevin Knox II, Kevin Looney, Bobby Portis, Taj Gibson, Warriors # 2 pick this year, Unprotected Warriors Pick in 2022 First Round, and Knicks #8 pick this year.  Warriors get James Harden, pick up a big off the scrap heap, and become favorites to win the West and maybe the title.  Knicks get Russell Westbrook and likely lose in the 1st of the playoffs, but will at least be relevant in the East.  Portis (15.7 million) and Gibson (9.4 million) are both expiring contracts that could be flipped again or bought out to save money. If I am the Warriors and Knicks I do this in a heartbeat. If I am the Rockets I only do this if there is absolutely no way I can convince Harden to stay AND I am desperate to cut salary. This deal would instantly cut their salary by 18.4 million with the possibility of cutting an extra 26.1 million, but you would have to take on Wiggins for 3 more years."
Fair enough. I just still can’t believe Russell Westbrook was thought of as the answer. *Especially* given the amount of draft assets they sacrificed in the process.
"James Harden, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard. Which of these players did Houston grow?"
"&gt;They’re likely to just watch as the other has the ball, neither are great off the ball players.  this wouldn't really matter since they'd both be so great at ISOing. the reason it doesn't work on the Rockets is because Harden just gets double teamed from half court. How the hell will you pull that off with KD and Kyrie on Harden's team?  &amp;#x200B;  off ball isn't as important as people seem to want it to be. ISOing is a completely fine strategy if you have the players to do it. and with these 3, they absolutely do. the problem with Houston was that the other guys were a bunch of 33% 3pt shooters and Russell Westbrook"
"Thoughts on this trade, assuming Fournier opts in:   Orlando gets:   * Russell Westbrook  * PJ Tucker  Rockets get:  * Aaron Gordon  * Evan Fournier  * Al-Farouq Aminu  Orlando upgrades at PG and arguably at PF. Rockets get some short term contracts (Aminu and Fournier) and AG, a young and decently valuable asset, but one which doesn't necessarily fit the Magic, especially with Isaac eventually coming back (who I expect the Magic are pinning their hopes on as their long term PF).   Orlando could run Westbrook/[Free Agent SG]/Ross/PJ/Vucevic until Isaac is back. That's a definite upgrade for them and should keep them in the playoffs, which is where they want to be right now for whatever reason.   Meanwhile the Rockets offload an old PF who won't fit their new timeline, an extremely expensive aging guard, and get a young decently promising wing in return. Fournier and AG would both fit this Rockets team right now, even if they keep Harden and try to contend. Harden/Fournier/Eric Gordon/Aaron Gordon/[Free Agent C] isn't bad at all"
"The fact that he can play at the 2 doesn't make him less of a PG. I'd argue he's more of a true point guard than Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook or any other number of high level guards. He can handle in the p&amp;r and make good passes out of it. Do you want other high level playmakers around him? Sure, yes, absolutely.  Kindly ignore my flair lol"
I consider him to be Russell Westbrook. Don't put the greats in a box
"So with talks of Serge going to Brooklyn and Harden going to Brooklyn, did the old Thunder squad form a reunion page and swap Westbrook for Kyrie? Durant low key messaging Ibaka and Harden when they left ""Lets meet up in Brooklyn 2021. Sorry about Russell"""
"Hot take: Russell Westbrook to the Knicks would be *LIT,* and that might be the best thing right now. I think that all the narrative issues about NYK not being a dynamic place to play, bad culture, etc, would be repudiated by Westbrook going hard as fuck taking a bajillion shots a game, and they might actually make the playoffs. NY would go absolutely ballistic.  I am principally a Celtics fan but I did live in NYC for 4 years and have a soft spot for the Knicks. I would love this."
To the Trade Machine...there's shit-posting afoot!   Kevin Love and Dante Exum for Russell Westbrook?
"Oh shit, Monty should have just had Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. Maybe next time!"
Russell Westbrook is awfully hypocritical for being frustrated about leeway being given to a player. Did he not watch his game film in OKC?...
"Knicks aren't looking too bad either. Well, at least until they trade some for Russell Westbrook."
No one wants to pay Russell Westbrook 46 million dollars when he’s 35? Color me shocked.
"Exactly.  Russell Westbrook was a negative contract, and he got traded for another negative contract and like 4 picks. By this logic, every trade for a positive contract should net more picks than the Thunder got in the Westbrook trade.  It hasn’t/won’t."
"Russell Westbrook's contract is one of, if  not the worst in the league. He is a negative value asset. They will not get any positive value back in return. Even if dallas picks are late first rounders they still have positive value.   The best the rockets can hope for is dumping Westbrook without having to attach any picks with him. That's why this trade request from Russ is so ridiculous, a negative value player cant really make trade demands"
"Props to taking the time to this and putting yourself out there. I've made plenty of my own lists and it's way easier to look at them and criticize than actually take the time to do it.  With that said, I think you're away off base here. Jamal Murray is solid you can't take the bubble games too seriously. He's closer to 50 than 20 and has no business ahead of Embiid, Mitchell, and others not even in your top 20 (like George and Adebayo). I have no idea what you're doing with Curry at 14, he still should be in everyone's top 5.   Butler, Booker, Murray, there's way to much recency bias here. However, I will throw out my top 20 so feel free to pick mine apart too, it only seems fair.  1) LeBron James  2) Giannis Antetokounmpo  3) Kevin Durant  4) Kawhi Leonard  5) Steph Curry  6) James Harden  7) Anthony Davis  8) Luka Doncic  9) Damian Lillard  10) Nikola Jokic  11) Joel Embiid  12) Jimmy Butler  13) Paul George  14) Jayson Tatum  15) Bradley Beal   16) Karl Anthony-Towns  17) Donovan Mitchell  18) Bam Adebayo  19) Russell Westbrook  20) Kyrie Irving  21) Rudy Gobert  22) Trae Young  23) Ben Simmons  24) Klay Thompson  25) Devin Booker  26) Pascal Siakam  27) Chris Paul  28) Brandon Ingram  29) Khris Middleton  30) Kyle Lowry  12-20 are very interchangeable and 21-30 are as well, you can also throw Jrue, Kemba, Ja, and Zion for top 30 consideration as well."
Theyre refusing to include the pick in any Russell Westbrook trade so I'd say they definitely they value that pick
"If Brooklyn really wants Harden, the rest of Houston's moves will be irrelevant. Your logic definitely adds up, but the way these star trades have gone in practice just doesn't really match the sound theory:  * AD wanted the Lakers and the Lakers only, and the Pelicans still got a really solid package in return * Paul George said trade me to the Clippers, and the Thunder got that insane package * Russell Westbrook demanded to go to Houston and OKC got a big package to swap him for Paul despite the awful contract  It would seem like a player demanding to go to one team would kill the trading team's leverage, but it's been the opposite. If a team wants a needle moving superstar, the pressure is on them to get the deal done. If they don't, they're the ones who have to answer to their other stars and their fans about why they didn't get it done when that player wanted to go there. KD, Kyrie, and the public knowing Harden wants to be a Net gives Houston all the leverage they need, moving RoCo and weakening the roster ultimately doesn't change that."
Please god no.  I hope the Knicks do not get Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook gets his wish to be the guy on a team
"Unfortunately for him, Russell Westbrook is going to realize that there really isn't a market for him right now."

I made a quick flow chart on whether or not teams should trade for Russell Westbrook:   Are you an NBA team---------&gt; Yes------------&gt; Do not trade for Russell Westbrook.
It's wild that people still think Darryl fuckin Morey of all people made the decision to trade for Russell Westbrook
"Russell ""Le French Quarter"" Westbrook"
"Be careful what you wish for, if you guys trade harden but can’t trade Russell you guys might be stuck watching Westbrook brick 3s for the next 3 years"
It's reserved for Russell Westbrook
"Nah, the Russell Westbrook trade already took that moniker."
"&gt;And you're still bringing up AD even tho that's a completely separate argument. I never said Kyrie was better than AD. Why are you still going on with this strawman?  I didn't say you said that. I'm merely using him as an example of somebody who is truly a ""ceiling raiser"" vs two players that aren't.    &gt;Especially when consensus second best player in the league in his prime left prime Russ because he knew he would never win a championship with him.   Which is hilarious considering Durant was a major reason that they lost that series.   &gt;And guess what, he went to 3 straight finals and won 2 of them  After he joined a team that had the best record of all time before they added him lmao. This is a horrible argument. Biggest sellout move in NBA history.   &gt;while Russ was flaming out in the first round 3 years in a row. And when KD decided on his next team, he didn't even think about reuniting with WB cuz he still know he's not gonna win a championship with him. You know who he did join? Kyrie.   Who gives a shit what Durant thinks? Lol. What would you say if Durant loses with Kyrie?    &gt;Now what did Kyrie do in those 3 years? He made it to the finals while playing terrific in one of them. He was injured in the other. And he lost to the Bucks with a bad playoff series, with a team that didn't have mvp runner up Paul George. I'd take one bad post season over 3 with mvp candidates any day.  Again, why does any of this mean that Kyrie is a ""ceiling raiser?"" I'm not even arguing who is better between Russ and Kyrie.   &gt;Idk why you keep saying Russ played with no one   I literally have never said this. I don't even know what you are talking about.    &gt;And if you're really going to trash Kyrie's defense, you should really look at Russell Westbrook's metrics who consistently rank as one of the worst players in the league on that end.  Again, they both suck at defense. That's exactly what I said. I keep telling you that both of them have had very similar shot comings as players lol.   Both bad at defense.   Both are pretty selfish.  Kyrie alienated teammates at both teams he's been a part of in the past.    Durant didn't like playing with Russ lol.    The biggest difference is that Kyrie won a ring playing with the arguable GOAT while Westbrook and Durant lost a title to the arguable GOAT.   If Kyrie changes his playstyle with Durant, then I'll agree with you. But he didn't change it with LeBron, which would have made Cleveland even better. He didn't change it in Boston and made half the team hate him."
"[Wojnarowski] He’s back. After years of retirement, Michael Jordan will wear red and back again but in Houston, in a blockbuster trade sending James Harden and Russell Westbrook to Charlotte.  Draft compensation to follow, sources tell ESPN."
"Lol well this was funny at the end. James turned down a deal that year and was traded abruptly. But even he regrets it. He played furiously in Houston immediately even his first games. Yet OKC excelled too. Maybe wins it all that very same year if Russell Westbrook doesn't get meniscus'd (by pat beverly booo). I agree the trade cursed them for a time after. This rebuild will get them over it in the long run and the owner should give Sam Presti everything he ever needs, he could be the mayor of that town if he wanted to... He's a deal maker and a blessing for their franchise.   Now I feel better too."
"People acting like we won the 20s already. While we are in a great position to succeed, the stars will still need to align for us to luck into superstar talent through the draft. This time around we don’t have a Russell Westbrook to attract big names to Oklahoma.  At the end of the day, I like our odds of at least remaining a perennial playoff team for the better part of this decade."
I’m not saying he’s not gonna have players but I bet he went into this head-coaching position believing that he had both James Harden and Russell Westbrook on the team
Maybe they could take the Russell Westbrook contract and get even more picks. That would be neat.
Russell Westbrook doesn't really get a say in the matter
"Being a Russell Westbrook fan is so hard.   When he's on... he's the man, he's so entertaining, and he just runs through everyone. But he just becomes indefensible so much of the time when he decides to go full brick city."
1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden 3. Luka Doncic 4. Damian Lillard 5. Klay Thompson 6. Chris Paul 7. Russell Westbrook 8. Donovan Mitchell 9. Jamal Murray 10. Devin Booker
"&gt;there is no evidence in Morey's past that suggests he may trade Simmons (for Harden)  Yeah I can see where this would be a sticking point. I also think it's not quite true, in that he traded Chris Paul away for Russell Westbrook. There's some extra context there, which is that the move seemed to be driven more by Harden and Fertitta than Morey. This trade was (IMO) a double negative, in that it was a downgrade (CP3 &gt; Russ) and they had to use extra capital to make it. I just can't see that being a move that Morey organically designed on his own.  The other part of that above quote that one could take issue with is that to my knowledge Morey hasn't been in this situation before, where he had a bonafide young star like Simmons with a chance to make a (potentially controversial) trade-up for a proven superstar. The only thing I could think of would be (complete hypothetical) if someone had given him a killer offer for Harden after the Rockets made the WCF in 2015, but we never heard about it as it never went anywhere."
Hear me out  Hou receives Kyrie Irving Jarrett Allen Joe Harris  2021 1st 2022 2nd  Bkn receives  Russell Westbrook  James Harden   Madness ensues
Cant wait to see ben simmons and russell westbrook tear it up for houston.
"And just to provide a bit more oomph behind my argument. I have Rubio somewhere between the 25th and 27th best point guard in the NBA. These are players I’m convinced are better than Rubio.  Walker Lowry VanVleet Irving Dinwiddie Simmons Bledsoe Brogdon Young Wall Dragic Rozier Morant J Holiday Westbrook Schroeder Curry Paul Fox Lillard J Murray Conley Russell SGA  I think I’d still rather have Kendrick Nunn or Devonte Graham than Rubio, but I figure this is where it starts to become a debate. Also, other point guard rankings by outlets have him somewhere around twenty, but those were done during the hiatus, and he’s now ageing out of his prime and younger players will come in from this draft don’t forget. But regardless, in what world does the twenty-something best point guard in the league deserve a contract approaching $20M?"
"He hasn’t exactly always had all the help he ever needed. He had an injured Dwight Howard. He had an old, injured Chris Paul. He had a past his prime, injured Russell Westbrook. Compare that to the help other superstars have had. I’m not a big Harden fan, but to act like he’s had all the help in the world is silly."
"Dwight Howard and Russell Westbrook were not the types of players you could put around Harden and win. CP3 was that guy in 2018 and they almost won it, but CP3 declined hard and had nagging injuries in 2019."
"Well, they could go the Russell Westbrook route of letting a franchise player go because he doesn't want to rebuild with them"
"""Houston is fully comfortable keeping Harden and Russell Westbrook into the season.""  &amp;#x200B;  Lol"

"Lebron James can be a Deva, Giannis can be a Deva, AD can be a Deva.  All Three have Era changing talent.  James Harden and Russell Westbrook can't be Deva's.  The numbers are there but not the Talent."
"If we roll it all the way back, it simplifies to Russell Westbrook and a 2009 2nd round pick (would become Emir Preldžić)"
"&gt; And realistically Harden and Westbrook are the best backcourt in the league because on his own Klay isn't that good of a player like Russell is and Harden &gt; Steph.  There’s not a team in the league that would take Westbrook over Klay and Steph, barring some big decline, is no question better than Harden. Think you just hate the Warriors or something."
"Full details  OKC sent:  - Russell Westbrook - Paul George  OKC recieved:  - Eight 1st round picks - 2021 (MIA), 2022 (PHX), 2022 (LAC), 2023 (MIA), 2024 (HOU), 2024 (LAC), 2026 (HOU), 2026 (LAC),   - Two 1st round pick swaps - 2023 (MIA), 2025 (MIA) - Two 2nd round pick swaps - 2021 (HOU) and 2025 (HOU) - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - Danila Gallinari - Kelly Oubre - Ricky Rubio - Ty Jerome - Halen Lecque"
"So, we traded Russell Westbrook and received the following assets after combining the two trades:  2021 Rockets pick swap (protected 1-4)   2022 Suns 1st (protected 1-12, decreasing each year)   2024 Rockets 1st (protected 1-4)   2025 Rockets pick swap (protected 1-20)   2026 Rockets 1st (protected 1-4)   Ricky Rubio   Kelly Oubre   Ty Jermoe   Jalen Lecque"
"It's not just 8 more years of experience though, is it? It's not like Harden is going to go back to being a 6th man of the year. It's not like Brooklyn is gonna surround them with defensive stalwarts. It's not like two of them aren't incredible injury risks. It's not like Russell Westbrook doesn't want to murder Kevin Durant. It would be a disaster."
"I don't know how Morey escaped all criticism for putting the Rockets into this situation.  He spent years openly mortgaging the team's future for short-term success, and then he jumped ship when the title window closed and it was time for a rebuild.  The Rockets traded their first round picks in 2020, 2024 and 2026.  They've committed to pick swaps in 2021 and 2025.  Chris Clemons is their only player under the age of 27, and their five starters have an average age of 32.  They're set to pay 35 year olds Russell Westbrook and Eric Gordon a combined $66 million in 2023, and both guys are already in steep decline.  Houston is the odds on favorite to have the NBA's worst record over the 2020's.  Unless they get a huge haul for Harden or hit a home run in the draft, this team is looking at a very bleak future."
Trading for Rockets legend Russell Westbrook and James Harden for a historic MVP duo.
Too late you just traded Mike Conley and Royce O’Neale to the Rockets for Russell Westbrook and some green jello.
"""If you play for the Lakers, you are more famous than your similarly skilled counterparts and you get referred to as a star.""  Seriously?  So Kyle Kouzma is more famous than James Harden? Russell Westbrook? Michael Jordan?  Piss off."
LeBron James and Anthony Davis to the Rockets for James Harden and Russell Westbrook 😳
&gt;More proven that an all star trio that went to 4/5 finals and won 3 rings?   Are we ignoring they kad KD for 3 of those?  I'm not saying no vet is going to join GSW but the most coveted ones I can't see joining GSW.  And realistically Harden and Westbrook are the best backcourt in the league because on his own Klay isn't that good of a player like Russell is and Harden &gt; Steph.
"That’s not even comparable. Prime Klay, Prime Steph, and Prime Draymond is a much better trio than a 23 year old KD, 21 year old Russell Westbrook, and 20 year old James Harden. But KD led them to the finals anyways beating teams like the spurs and grizzlies.    And you’re forgetting about depth too.   Iguodala, Bogut, Harrison Barnes, Livingston, Barbosa, Looney, Varejao  Is much better than Kendrick Perkins, Serge Ibaka, Old Derek Fisher, Sefolosha, and Nazr Mohammed.  Steph had a better team than KD ever did before he joined GSW. To say Steph punctuated the team’s all time great runs is acceptable. But to completely ignore the roster and say Steph did more with less than KD is stupid.  Give KD that warriors team, and they’re winning a chip too."
Russell Westbrook did what only one player in the history of the league has done. He did it 3 times. HoF obviously. Nephew

"Where do you think these players will start this season?  - Chris Paul: Suns - James Harden: Rockets - Russell Westbrook: Hornets - Serge Ibaka: Raptors  This is my prediction, I could be really wrong. Also, isn't it weird that 3 of the OKC Big 4 may be moving?"
"&gt;Despite a whirlwind of recent trade rumors involving All-Star guards [**James Harden**](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/tag/james-harden/) and [**Russell Westbrook**](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/tag/russell-westbrook/), the Houston Rockets aren’t currently interested in tearing apart the team, according to the media member that knows them best.   &gt;   &gt;Per longtime beat writer [**Jonathan Feigen**](https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Feigen) of the *Houston Chronicle*, the franchise’s goal remains “to make their core players believe again in the team’s championship chances.”   &gt;   &gt;A big part of that process would be improving the surrounding roster. With the NBA’s trade moratorium [**ending Monday**](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/11/15/woj-nba-to-lift-trade-moratorium-on-monday-morning/) and free agency opening Friday, the Rockets “believe they can bring in the help” to regain Harden’s confidence in their status as a title contender, per Feigen.   &gt;   &gt;“The Rockets have no interest in tearing things down to restock shelves with draft picks and prospects and start over,” [**Feigen writes**](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-nation/rockets/article/Rockets-new-leadership-on-the-clock-with-James-15729418.php). He correctly points out that with Oklahoma City having the [**right to swap picks**](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/detailed) with Houston in the first round of the 2021 draft, there’s minimal incentive for the Rockets to consider rebuilding scenarios at this time.   &gt;   &gt;As of Sunday, Westbrook had [**formally requested**](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/11/13/woj-rockets-open-to-westbrook-trade-but-contract-stalls-market/) a trade, while Harden had not. However, Feigen indicates that the Rockets are hopeful that they can salvage the relationship with both. With regards to Westbrook, Feigen cites a source as saying that he wants to feel as if he can “be himself,” similar to his days with the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Rockets, however, believe that could happen with adjustments in Houston.   &gt;   &gt;While things could change quickly, Feigen says that trade talks involving the stars by new Rockets GM [**Rafael Stone**](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/tag/rafael-stone/) have been closer to “listening” and “exploring,” rather than “shopping.” With free agency not opening until 5:00 p.m. Friday, it sounds as if the Rockets may wait until after that point to finalize decisions regarding Westbrook and Harden — since the primary objective is restoring their confidence in Houston as a contender, and free agent signings and/or trades could play a large role in that."
I think Kemba is more comparable to Agent Zero? and Stephon Marbury is a middle-class Russell Westbrook
I feel so bad for the Rockets. They gave up **two** future FRPs (both 1-4 protected) + **two** future FRPs swaps + Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook. Yikes!
"&gt; Those are bold claims about an all time great scorer who took a backseat to Steph the same way Steph took a backseat to him.   KD told me everything I needed to know about his mindset when he swapped Steph Curry for Kyrie Irving.  Steph is one of those rare players, like Lebron, who you don't leave.  You leave Russell Westbrook, you don't leave Steph Curry, if you have a choice.  You certainly don't leave Steph for Kyrie.    Every cat is different, though, and KD made his call, and I respect it.  He wants to be in the GOAT conversation, and I get that.  If that's what he wants, I hope he finds what makes him happy.    He gave us 3 wonderful years, but anytime I hear of a guy who wants to leave playing with Lebron James, that tells me that player has a few screws loose.  To the best of my knowledge, Kyrie is the only one whose ever left Lebron.  Other stars (Kevin Love, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, and Anthony Davis) bend over and fit their games to play with Lebron.    KD left Steph, Kyrie left Lebron.  That's why it won't work in Brooklyn.  My father worked for Apple Computers under Steve Jobs, no one leaves that job once they get it.  I view KD as all-time great, but I don't think he's all about winning over everything else.  I think there are other considerations he values more highly.  That's fine, like I said, everyone's different."
"No team with this version of Russell Westbrook as its best player is making the playoffs in this Western conference. Five years ago Russ? Sure. But, five years ago Russ was 5th in the league in WS/48, just ahead of LeBron. He has gotten worse every year since, and this year he was tied for 99th with DJ Augustin. Russ has been declining for years, and he's not leading anyone anywhere anymore."
"So, we're going to have LeBron, AD, and Schroeder on the Lakers, Durant, Harden and Irving on the Nets, and also this fun logjam of Conf. Finals teams like the Sixers, Warriors, Mavs, Bucks, Raptors, Celtics, Heat, and Wizards, *and* you're going to have this fun Russell Westbrook team.  Well, this is going to be *fun*, predetermined or not."
Russell Westbrook with a midrange is way better than Steph Curry
Russell Westbrook and young Mike Tyson have very similar looking heads
"These commentators have no idea what they're talking about but their reactions when the players screw up are hilarious   ""Russell Westbrook just kinda threw something up there""  ""Embiid passed it to D'Antoni""  ""What was that?"""
"""Russell Westbrook just kinda threw something up there"""
"These kids be dogging me for telling them giant Russell Westbrook is a uneducated comparison. Kids don't even know there were players that were actually similar to Giannis at his size, instead they say something obvious because Russ is a current player that everyone knows."
"[Here’s how badly Rockets outscored Thunder when Westbrook was on the bench ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/4/26/15431112/russell-westbrook-rockets-thunder-lineups-2017)   People were arguing that Harden had the exact same quality supporting cast. Just flat out wrong.  &gt;When Westbrook was on the floor (39 min per game) OKC outscored Houston 4.9 points per possession.  &gt;*When Westbrook sat, OKC was outscored **51.3** points per 100 possessions*  &gt;**In real terms, when Westbrook sat this series, the Thunder were outscored 137-79 in 45.5 minutes of total court time. They lost by 58 points without Westbrook playing. For the entire series, Houston only outscored Oklahoma City by 43 points.**  &gt; Russell Westbrook was off the floor for **6 minutes** in Game 5.   &gt;In those 6 minutes, the Rockets outscored the Thunder **27-9**."
"&gt;Tell me what he does well in a half court offense?  Simmons is a great cutter, he cuts more and scores more on cuts than any other player on the Sixers. He ranks #1 among guards in points scored on cuts per game (shooting 70% on them)  He is a solid driver and is very good at passing off of drives. More than 11% of his drives end in assists (this is around the same frequency as Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, etc)  Even though his passing in a half-court offense is incomparable to his transition playmaking, he is still a good passer within a set offense. He makes more passes per game than anyone in the league not named Nikola Jokic, and the vast majority of these come in half-court.  He leads all guard in assists from the elbow and assists from the post.  While he has his limitations and very glaring ones at that, calling him horrible in a set offense is a vast overstatement, and calling him a horrible offensive player overall is completely uneducated."
"Commandment 1 - Do not every say thay CP3 is better than, or ages better than, Russell Westbrook. Some fans may think it, occasionally, but it is the law that it be left unsaid, out of respect."
But it's James Harden and Russell Westbrook. They're going to come up short when it matters the most
Russell westbrook cannot be a part of a championship team. James harden is too good to be a second option but not good enough to be a true number one option so will most likely end his career without a championship. Ben simmons is a better player than trae young.
Shoutout to Russell Westbrook for ending his chances of ever winning a championship with that game winner over us a few years ago 🍺

"I can see where they're coming from though. Even if they absolutely **had** to move one of our two teams, I think the Kings were the ones that deserved to go.   The Sonics were around in Seattle way longer than the Kings have been in Sac (they started in 68 and the Kings moved to Sac in 1985)  Also, the Sonics won a title in the late 70's. They had a long legacy of being a consistently good to great team.  They drafted Fred Brown, Dennis Johnson, Jack Sikma, Vinnie Johnson, Xavier McDaniel, Nate McMillan, Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Rashard Lewis, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook.  A good number of those are Hall of Fame players and the rest in the group are ""hall of very good"". The number the Kings could boast would be much smaller.  Sacramento's crowning achievement is the playoff runs of the early 00's, which are still the stuff of legends around here, but the longevity of that run doesn't really compare to the Sonics making the Finals in 96 and going head to head with the Rockets Jazz, and Spurs through most of the mid 90's (though I'd argue the best version of the Greatest Show on Court could beat the best version of those Sonics teams).  Our team has also been terribly mismanaged compared to the Sonics organization. I don't want to get into the weeds too far, but the Maloofs were the first team to get us anywhere near a long playoff run, and that was 15 years after the team moved here. After that little run imploded they fired our amazing GM for no reason and proceeded to bleed every ounce of cash out of the team they could as attendance and enthusiasm depleted. We were damn lucky Vivek came and bought us up (as crazy as the dude is) because we were on life support.  And to top all of that off, Seattle is a gigantic city when compared to Sac.  I love my city and my team, and I would be devastated if they left,  But it makes no logical sense why the Sonics lost their team and we kept ours, and the fact that we did was a complete ""oops we fucked up, lets make it up to the next smaller market team"" move by Stern."
"Dumbest shit i’ve ever read. Russell Westbrook is an all time great, first ballot hall of famer. Jamies Winston is mediocre at best"
Well for starters we had Kevin Durant who he's basically a generational score carrying   the loads for two people . Then you have Russell Westbrook who can't shoot but can score. It is really hard to find another guy that good as Kevin Durant for starters and we still didn't win like it was really rough in the fourth quarter when people world double KD and leave Andrew Robinson wide open.   But more importantly fergus's defense is not as good as Robertson and I actually do not remember Robertson finishing multiple games with zero points yet he's a really good cutter and a can actually finish Ferguson I don't know he's just I just don't understand how you can manage to play 30-plus minutes and finish with zero points multiple games  Sorry for the typos using voice to text
Mod blazer fan doesn’t want to hear how his team sucks. All I’m gonna say is Russell Westbrook wouldn’t be 7 games under .500 less than halfway through the season and losing by 20 to the knicks if he had to drag this team through the season
Russell “Dirty Little Pigboy” Westbrook
"&gt; Bruh, the Bucks 2nd best player is Kris. The Rockets 2nd best player won MvP. Come off it.  Khris Middleton and Russell Westbrook really aren't that far apart right now in 2019/2020. At least Middleton hits 40% from 3, Westbrook is chucking up almost as many attempts while shooting 29% from deep  If you gonna accuse Harden of stat-padding (he's scoring a fuckton of points, big whoop, isn't that the point of the game), Westbrook's MVP season was an even more egregious stat-padding exercise considering he posted historically high usage rates as well the team being instructed to let him grab as many defensive rebounds as possible (to start fast-breaks, yeah sure whatever)"
"He ended the Russell Westbrook chapter of your franchise, which I'm guessing most OKC fans now believe was a good thing"
"It goes to show the full scope of his athleticism. We didn't appreciate how great it was when he was in Miami. But now he's still a very elite athlete despite not being able to do a lot of the things he use to. I don't think it's a stretch to say he's the greatest pure athlete ever. Him, Russell Westbrook, Usain Bolt are just three of the best I've ever seen in my lifetime."

"Kobe had a bigger load than nash in 06, jordan had a bigger load than magic in 88, wilt over Russell, Steph over harden 2015, rose over Dwight and bron, Duncan over Garnett, I can go on and on  Winning gets rewarded every year except Westbrook, and regardless of his historic season, he wouldn’t have MVP if not for KD leaving and the base 10 decimal counting system   29-11-8 on 61ts% with 55 wins &gt; 31-10-10 on 55ts% 6 seed on 47 wins  Not trying to trigger thunder fans, Westbrook had a historic season, but the way it was awarded goes against how it’s been awarded every year before and since"
I want to hear more stories about how this team basically got better by trading away Russell Westbrook.
Russell westbrook will blamed regardless
Is Russell Westbrook going to be treated like Charles Barkley a HOF who is not going to win championship?
Russell westbrook is a good man he don't like abusing anyone
If you don't like Russell Westbrook you don't like NBA basketball!  Real 1!
Russell Westbrook also retrained his running mechanics to take more load off of his knees and ankles. It’s a pretty popular thing nowadays for players with knee issues.
“Low bbiq”... Do you think you know more about how to play basketball than Russell Westbrook?
"I don’t think the nuggets winning a championship this year either. But rockets aren’t making it out of the 1st round, heard it here first. Gonna get beat by the jazz or some shit in 6, behind  6-22 shooting from Westbrook and 8-28 shooting from Harden. And then they’ll fuck around and trade Russell in the off-season when they learn what Durant learned 4 or so years ago. That Westbrook doesn’t do anything but make stupid decisions."

I have to admit that I was absolutely wrong about Russell Westbrook.  I thought he will be bad for the Rockets.  It turned out that he is the one that is keeping their season alive.
Russell is fucking possessed tonight. By the spirit of Russell Westbrook.
"&gt;Imagine 18 months ago, after the Rockets won 65 games, if someone told you the team could get Russell Westbrook and Robert Covington for the low, low price of: · Chris Paul · Clint Capela · Nene · Gerald Green · 2020 1st · 2021 1st swap · 2024 1st · 2025 1st swap · 2026 1st  There's your answer"
"I wonder if DM when hes penning his memoirs about the moreyball era will include a recount of how his team owner, who probably doesnt watch much basketball outside of his courtside seats, made him trade for the star that is russell westbrook. That would be good reading."
Stephen Curry  Prime D rose  Celtics 2017 Isaiah Thomas  2017 Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard
"uhh definitely not because people are tired of seeing a game with efficient shooting between teams with players like james harden, russell westbrook, lebron james, and anthony davis.  ratings are on the decline because:  a) streaming. dont kid urself, it's obviously a factor  b) there is no superteam  c) injuries  d) bad teams this season are really bad   e) the warriors/pels got too many national tv games  etc"
"you'd cry at him bricking a 3 then, you need a life so bad fuck all you do is cry about Russell Westbrook to the point of mental illness levels"
This looks exhausting for Russ. If this offense works it will confirm what we’ve always suspected — Russell Westbrook is literally a new type of Terminator sent from even further in the future.
"Unable to work out an extension with James Harden, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded the Sixth Man of the Year to the Houston Rockets on Saturday night, breaking up the young core of the Western Conference champions.  Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook will undergo surgery in the coming days to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee.  Thunder's Kevin Durant (foot) will miss rest of season.  The Oklahoma city thunder have blown a 3-1 lead to the golden state warriors.  Kevin Durant has signed with the Golden state warriors.  Paul George has been traded to the clippers.  Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets."
if its to do with Russell Westbrook he will always cry like a baby back bitch
"There's a lot to consider with this trade - it's a cool one to think about especially before we see anything happen as a result.  I'm thinking about: is it weird that Russell chose against Minnesota just 8 months ago in free agency and now he's there ""against his will""? Is it a bit of a Carmelo situation where he forced them to give up assets they could have kept if he had signed outright (obviously there are other non-parallels to Carmelo)?  Then again, is Wiggins an asset? Is getting out from under his contract the biggest win here for Minnesota? With Paul, Westbrook, and Wiggins traded in one year - there is no such thing as an untradeable deal.  Can't wait to see Wiggins in Golden State and Russell in the Purple Rain Wolves jerseys."
Giannis “Russell Westbrook” Last Name
He has been great defensively all season. He disrupted almost all of his match ups defensively except when he was matched up against Russell Westbrook. That guy murdered him for some reason
Russell Westbrook shot the East out of the game.
"His finals teams had a lot of weapons, but he still lit up the scoreboard, which means he's so good and clutch that even his stacked teams knew to give him the ball. He's so good that Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden understood that the best gameplan was to get KD the ball."
Those are all-star numbers if your name is Russell Westbrook.
"Lol thunder started their rebuild with Russell Westbrook and Paul George, sixers started theirs w jrue holiday and Evan turner."
I guess you haven't watched Russell Westbrook that much then.. he used to do this like once a month a few years ago

"Well, James harden and Russell Westbrook are really good at basketball, so that helps them win a lot of times."
Russell Westbrook vs the rim
Russell Westbrook :(
"Let’s not forget, Houston is playing Russell Westbrook and Eric Gordon instead of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant"
"We have freaking james harden and russell westbrook. Houston NEVER tanks, they don't value draft picks bc they don't believe thats the best way to improve. They rather trade it and stay competitive util another opportunity of getting a star comes up."
"Raps fans overrate the hell out of OG, it's infuriating. Our sub talks about him like he's a top 10 prospect in the league. He's our new Norm.  Fun fact: a few years ago in a hypothetical trade thread, someone said that they wouldn't trade Norman Powell for Russell Westbrook. It was upvoted and anyone who disagreed was downvoted.  We also definitely overrate Terence Davis. Some of it I feel is due to our guys always being underrated by sports media, so we overrate them to compensate or something."
"As a big fan of Russ, Houston has become my 2nd team to watch. Now I'm not the best guy when it comes to NBA trades but, Houston; What the fuck did you just do? Do you want Russell Westbrook to become the team leader in rebounds? Because this is the worst possible way to do so."
Morey: “And now for my next trick I will turn Russell Westbrook into D’Angelo Russell.”
"He has, but he traded CP3, Capela, and 4 first round picks for fucking Robert Covington and Russell Westbrook. He is not the same."

Holy shit I imagined Russell westbrook I was like woah
Plot twist: All those rumor tweets referring to Russell was actually about Westbrook
"I’m going to be honest, at first it meant Russell Westbrook for Wiggins."
"Man, the Lakers section to give up Troy Daniels and a 2nd round pick for IT. IF the Wiz got that offer, I legitimately think a legion of Wiz fans would personally drive the man to the airport.  John Wall + Picks for Russell Westbrook, at that point, I'm convinced the writers either dont watch the wiz/understand the Wiz trajectory or had to come up with some nonsense to fill out the article.   Bertans for Mike Scott + Picks, If its Zhaire Smith, Scott, and a first round pick, I think the Wiz would consider it. Or Bertans for straight up Thybulle &amp; salary filler + 2nd round picks, the Wiz would heavily consider it."
"He’s like Drose and Russell Westbrook combined when it comes to being reckless. I love that he tries to get his bucket, but I cringe every time he tries to dunk on a 7fter"
Russell Westbrook
"Woah wait, hol-up wait, hold up for just one second... since when did RUSSELL WESTBROOK get back into the top 12?"
"Any casual fan who turns on ESPN right now will know what he’s doing. Small markets limit exposure, but someone like Russell Westbrook is a textbook example of a player rising above his market’s ceiling to become a household name."
Name 12 point guards better than Russell Westbrook right now.
"Harden and Westbrook to OKC, new lineup:  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Shai  Aquaman"

Anyone who denigrates the name of Russell Westbrook.
Puttin' up a Russell Westbrook shooting line
"His season long sample is 34 games, you bozo. There's still more than 40 games left.  Your placing primary importance on his bad 13 game stretch and assuming he's going to maintain his bad efficiency for the rest of the year, and I'm placing primary importance on his recent and good 14 game stretch where his overall efficiency has been trending upwards over the last six weeks.  And again, if you actually watched the Rockets, you might say something like that their bad form is due to Harden looking fatigued or EG trying to find his rhythm or Rivers and House's form falling off a cliff but instead you chose to go the safe and lazy route by circlejerking about Russell Westbrook on a community that hates the guy."

"https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  &gt;Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  &gt;That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  Yes, you having a ridiculous stance means you're wrong.  This has been analyzed, hes NOT doing it to the detriment of the team.  You repeating it and saying everyone is lying makes it worse."
He can shoot threes. When I see teams start seeing teams go under on screens and sag off him then we can say he can’t shoot.    I get he is shooting like 31% from three but he can obviously shoot. I’m sure you thought KD as a rookie was a bad shooter or Kobe couldn’t shoot during his threepeat if you go by just percentages    If you start guarding him like he’s Giannis or Russell Westbrook from three then he is going to make you pay
Wilt and Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook would do himself a service to NOT talk shit to or about Dame Lillard in the interim.  He had not been ""busting that ass for years"" when he said that mess last year, and he certainly hasn't been busting that ass since."
Did Russell Westbrook goad Dame Lillard into those bad shots?  It was supposed to be the other way around.
"If Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook faced off in the octagon, who wins?"
Russell Westbrook can’t win with these cats
Death  Taxes  The Blazers dumpstering Russell Westbrook
"Comparing somebody's shooting percentage to Russell Westbrook is kinda the lowest bar.  &amp;#x200B;  As an aside, I'm kinda more intrigued that Morant, at his age, is not only the first scoring option at decent efficiency in itself, but he also is above Westbrook in amount of points off assists: almost 18 points off his assists in less than 30 minutes per game. And increasing throughout the season. Dude's leading a really fun offense."
"It's not about pace. Seriously - look at [pace for each season on bkref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html) and you'll see pace today is the same as in the 80s.  It's mostly about having a few star players holding a kind of carte blanche in today's more positionless league. Either (tall) guards who rebound with ease and want to (e.g. Luka, Simmons, Westbrook - shorter but jumps real high and goes after them), playmaking tall guys (e.g. Giannis, Jokic), as well as the ultimate swiss army knife called LeBron, who do everything on the court. It's also partially about TDs [being a ""thing""](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/04/05/oscar-robertson-russell-westbrook-triple-double-nba-record/100099510/) now, while they didn't use to really track them in the past.  Of the 56 TDs this year thus far, the 6 guys I've listed have 39 TDs between them, and another 10 players split the remaining 17, so it's not like everyone is getting them, it's just a few guys with particular playstyles and roles racking them up. Shoutout to Butler who is the only one not listed above with 3(+) TDs. Oh yeah, and a TD in itself is meaningless, and most players know that."
You’re forgetting Russell Westbrook
"See, this is the problem with using team success as interchangeable with individual success.  You can just mold it to whatever narrative you want.  Derrick Rose had a lot of team success with the Bulls, who were the #1 defensive team and won 48 games without him after he blew out his knee.  That was a great team - but yeah, he was just carrying guys like Ronnie Brewer.  And look at how you're talking about Russ.  First, you dismiss the entire best part of his career because he wasn't ""the guy"" since they had KD (look how well he led the Thunder in KD's foot injury season, if you're willing to count that).  Then you're dismissing Russ because ""he leaves and OKC is still a playoff team,"" but ignoring the fact that they replaced him with CP3, SGA, *and* Gallinari.    Let's cut the bullshit and stop guessing about how much of their teams' success they were responsible for.  Because realistically, that's impossible to quantify.  Answer me this - what do you think Derrick Rose was better at on the basketball court than Russell Westbrook?    I really don't think there's much of an answer to that question.  They were a very similar mold of player, but Russ because of injuries holding Rose back, Westbrook hit a *much* higher high."
"He’s underrated on this sub but I think he’s definitely been a cut below Dame and Kyrie this season and last season too for that matter, a couple years ago he’d definitely be in the mix. [Here is the comparison of this year](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Damian+Lillard&amp;player_id1_select=Damian+Lillard&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id1=lillada01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Kyrie+Irving&amp;player_id3_select=Kyrie+Irving&amp;y3=2020&amp;player_id3=irvinky01&amp;idx=players)  I wish the mods hadn’t banned the player comparison bot, it’s so useful in other sports subs and would generate better discussion here."
"Players with stats equivalent or better than Ja Morant:  Lebron James   Anthony Davis   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Luka Doncic   Nikola Jokic   Damian Lillard   Rudy Gobert   Donovan Mitchell   Bojan Bogdanovic   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   Chris Paul   DeMar DeRozan   LeMarcus Aldridge   Brandon Ingram   Devin Booker   Kawhi Leonard   Paul George   Karl Anthony Towns    With Ja Morant, that makes 20.

I believe Russell Westbrook won't make it
"If it wasn't for ""shit on Russell Westbrook"" threads this subreddit would be pretty close to dead this season. Which I think is actually the point, the internet and especially r/NBA isn't REALLY a place to discuss things so much as a place for people to find things to be mad about and complain about. The NBA season has very little things to complain about. The league doesn't have a villain team or a villain player (KD Out, no evil empire Warriors, everyone loves L.A. Bron). At this point the closest thing to villains are the Harden/Russ Rockets and they aren't actually doing anything bad besides being inefficient which really isn't enough to make a guy a villain but this subreddit seems so desperate for something to shit on they're more or less grasping for any ""can we hate Russell Westbrook/Ben Simmons for not making 3s""."
Russell westbrook is currently an mvp caliber player to you?
"Occasionally an MVP will be picked without a great record (most recent was Russell Westbrook in 2017), but record usually matters a lot. With the amazing numbers Giannis is putting up, he would still definitely be in the conversation if his team was remotely good. Harden's case would definitely benefit from the Bucks having a worse record, though."
Y’all leave my favorite player alone man.lol. He ain’t good enough  that posts need to be made about how bad is and much you hate him anymore. Especially since some of you conveniently disappear when he plays well or you were expecting to him and he proves you wrong. They’re better and more relevant stars to post about than Russell Westbrook. Y’all must be bored.lol. Parity not as interesting as you thought it’d be or something?
Russell Westbrook is the only other player to do the same.
Russell Westbrook would like a word
Morant is going to be a PROBLEM.  Love that kids ferocity. He's going to be a better Russell Westbrook when it's all said and done.
"Can't be right, Russell Westbrook and /r/nba told me he does nothing when he runs around and totally sucks despite playing 30+ MPG on a lot of great teams"
"If James Harden was in his ear saying “Get Chris Paul outta here, I want Russell Westbrook” then I don’t really think so"
"For a team that according to r/NBA actually plays better with Russell Westbrook and are ""winning in spite of him, not because of him"", the Rockets seem to struggle whenever he's out. It's as if his impact isn't just in the stats and you actually have to watch the games."
You think Reggie Jackson would be guarding Russell Westbrook

"He's right. He's also one of those guys. Russ has been a superstar in the NBA for the past decade. MVP, scoring title a few times, assists leader, 8X all star. He has the fan base, he's a top 5 followed NBA player on Instagram. Averaged a triple double for the past 3 years. ALOT of playoff success. I see a lot of new fans base his success of the last 3 years. Lately he's been playing like a top 5 player in the league as well. Hate him or love him, Russell Westbrook one of the most talented players to step foot on the court. He's that guy."
Kyrie is simply not a better basketball player than Russell Westbrook

Russell Westbrook
"&gt;I'm not saying Barrett is going to be terrible but it's probably smart to set expectations a little lower considering how awful he is as a rookie or at least expect him to take much longer to turn into the player you thought he could be at the draft.  This part is probably fair when I said ""hasnt changed that much since pre draft"" I guess I coulda also phrased it as ""I think it's a little more likely he busts or just doesnt do what I expected"" but not so much in a way that I think is significant. Your pt especially about him taking longer to develop than expected is valid. The reason I brought up yr 2 is Ive heard both Howard Beck and Zach Lowe bring this up separately at different times but many GMs and people in the NBA have a general guideline when it comes to evaluations. Rookie yrs whatever happens happens but if by the mid to late part of yr  2 a guy still is just showing nothing and looks really bad that's usually enough of a sample you can start writing him off. Dennis Smith is an ex. I guess that's kinda where I come down on and why I was posting about how I think next year is important.   You can [use this as a rough proxy the past 30 yrs rookies with relatively similar caliber performances in terms of scoring inefficiency and as a rough proxy WS/48](http://bkref.com/tiny/N8Dxl)  Names on here that came up that I think are interesting and worht looking at here:   Andrew Wiggins Brandon Jennings Raymond Felton John Wall Russell Westbrook Brandon Knight Victor Oladipo Dion Waiters Trey Burke Rudy Gay DAngelo Russell De'Aaron Fox Dennis Smith Josh Jackson Zach LaVine  You have some busts on here. You have some stars. You have a bunch of guys somewhere in between. I think he is just flat out more talented and has more ability than a guy like Trey Burke or Dennis Smith(who it wasnt just about ability as to why he flopped) which is part of why Im not as low on him. But that's my own judgment and assessment others can differ. The one I keep coming back to is like a somewhat more skilled Rudy Gay. Not a great player probably not even a real All Star but a good NBA player. But like I said above and to your pt yeah its probably smarter to acknowledge hte chances of him not becoming that are somewhat higher now"

The fact that Westbrook hasn't been well tonight and we are barely holding a lead is worrisome. We are too overtly focused on Harden and the others are making us play   And we can't expect a star like Russell to stay cold. It's like expecting PG13 to not show up at all in a playoff series. Just won't happen
Russell Westbrook is so fucking bad at basketball it’s unreal

"Even though I am a better shooter than Russell Westbrook, you gotta admit that he plays so god damn hard"
#RUSSELL WESTBROOK HAS COMBINED FOR MORE FOULS AND TURNOVERS THEN ASSITS AND POINTS
If you told me before the playoffs started that Russell Westbrook would lose a lot of games for Houston I would say ya that sounds exactly like Russell Westbrook
If you told me at the start of this year Russell Westbrook would be a total hit or miss game to game I would tell you that yeah that makes a lot of sense
"Lmao the disrespect to Russell Westbrook. No close-out on the 3, then Lebron waiting for the airball under the hoop"
"1) Stockton (everyone will be fed and the opposing PG will always have a hard time running a consistent offense and getting into sets)  2) Iverson (top scorer yet massive defensive liability. You need a specific type of PG to successfully play alongside him, can either inspire or turn team into dumpster-fire)  3) Rose (scared the shit out of the NBA before his chronic knee issues. Only player close to Russell Westbrook in play style)  4) Lillard (Clutch gene, very loyal and always rises to the occassion. Franchise centerpiece and future all-time great)"
Russell Westbrook
laker player of the game so far: Russell Westbrook
russell westbrook  🤝 me in 4th grade           turning the ball over an inexplicable amount
terrible sequence for Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is the without a doubt the most overrated star in the league. Every possession was wasted. Chris Paul is missed.
I don't think Russell Westbrook has been very good at basketball since coming back from injury
"Russell Westbrook.  Seems like an awesome dude, love to watch him play when he's good and so funny when he's not.  But when I actually wants his team to win games (mainly because I don't like the opponent) he can be so frustrating like he can make a play that 3 players in the history can make and the possession after he can look like me If I was trying to bring the ball up against Gary Payton fumbling the ball"
"It's evolved over time, but it's basically now considered to be the idea that if a star player goes down, the rest of the team's offense improves because suddenly they have to share the ball and play a better team offense without a star to carry the load.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The Thunder, for example, were completely Westbrook-dominated whenever he was playing and would marginalize the other players and have little ball movement. Whenever Russell didn't play, though, we looked absolutely terrible because we needed his shot creation and couldn't make up for it with more team ball."
Have we ever seen Russell Westbrook and Ratatouille in the same room?
"Patrick Beverley, Russell Westbrook and 3 other players"
Russell Westbrook is just a more athletic raymond felton
"Nah I get it. Wilt's skills were obvious. Russell's were sneakier.  Russell vs. Wilt is the ultimate example of the things that help teams win vs. ""dominating the game."" Wilt made every team he played on into ""The Wilt Chamberlain Show."" Every possession ran through him. Much like Iverson, or Westbrook, he changed the way his team played when he stepped on the court; everyone's job was to facilitate him. The problem was, he all but removed his teammates from the picture.  That's a strategy to make bad supporting casts pretty good and make great supporting casts only pretty good. Wilt is better than AI or Brodie, but still. It's a big part of why his better teammates consistently ""underperformed"" when he played with them. It's pretty hard to make an All-Star game if you have to give 60% of your touches to Wilt. Not to mention he was a coach killer and renowned asshole. Wilt also famously decided not to shoot at all in a crucial 4th quarter of a playoff game just to spite his coach; that's not a guy who's gonna dig deep when challenged.  Russell on the other hand was the ultimate in quiet value. Like a shutdown corner in football, people were scared to test him. It's not a strategy that works anymore, but in 1960 if you could make the other team settle for jumpers, you weren't gonna lose. Especially because Russell was the league's best rebounder and a loose ball magnet. Why would he chase after a guy when he could clog the cutting lanes and bait a bad shot? I do think his defense is more active than you realize, though; by all accounts the dude got like 8 blocks a game. Yeah there were lots of missed layups and nobody could shoot but you can't judge by the standards of today. Also you could play him at crunchtime, unlike Wilt, who shot like 50% from the line.   Finally, the proof is in the statistical pudding. Russell led USF to a 55-game win streak in college. When he showed up the Celtics' D immediately went from below-average to best in the league. When he left it immediately went back to average. By DRtg, he helmed the 2 best single season defences ever and 5 of the top 10. He played 45 minutes a night and stayed mostly  healthy, so on-off splits are hard. But when Cousy missed time, the team kept chugging. Same with Hondo, and Heinsohn, and Sam Jones. When Russell missed time they collapsed.   Someone else could fill the other roles. Nobody else in the NBA could guard 1-5, could shut down fastbreaks and postups (the most efficient shots at the time) without fouling, and could be the hyper-aware communicator that made the machine hum. Don't compare him to Lebron or Giannis. Compare him to Duncan. TD had plenty of games where he put up a quiet 16-12-4 with a few nice plays but nothing amazing. Somehow, though, the other team's bigs would have shot 35% and picked up some fouls, and their slashers would've settled for 18 footers instead of getting to the rim. Russell did that on steroids. Maybe it wouldn't translate to 2020, and maybe you don't see it in the tape, but his value was immense."
"Bucks are actually better without the ""DPOY"" and ""MVP""  Russell Westbrook syndrome perhaps"
"This is the Russell Westbrook that I envisioned since he first came in the NBA.   I thought he would a solid offensive player, but a great defensive player.  I did not expect him an elite offensive player but maddening to watch defensive player."
"My top 6 favourites :   VC,   Westbrook,    Zion,   Jordan,   LeBron, Lillard  My top 20: JORDAN, LeBron, wilt, Kobe, Harden, Karl Malone, bill Russell , Lillard, curry, Durant, Shaq, (PRIME) Dwight, (PRIME) d.rose, (PRIME) Westbrook, Bird, Kareem, dirk, Duncan, Hakeem, magic, (hopefully) Zion. This is in no order past top 5."
"Oh really they smoked every team that didn't have LeBron? I'm almost sure that they were down 3-1 in the WCF after getting blown out of the state of Oklahoma in Games 3 and 4, but i might be imagining things.  If Russell Westbrook didn't shit the bed for three straight games the mighty 73-9 Warriors wouldn't have even made the Finals."
Chris Paul traded to HOU for Russell Westbrook
"You could do this with any guard who averages high rebound numbers.  Luka this season has 9.2 rebounds but only 2.0 contested, which is less contested rebounds than Caleb Swanigan (3.8 total), Jaxson Hayes (4.1 total), and Russell Westbrook this season (7.9 total).  I think the point OP is trying to make is that either both of them are statpadding or neither of them are, and that other players are doing similar things to Russ.  I do agree that Russ’s rebounds were inflated in OKC due to Steven Adams box-outs, and that his stars this year are less inflated in HOU (his 28.2% contested rebounds this year is higher than players like LeBron, Kawhi, Simmons at least).  I think it depends on whether you interpret the “center boxes out for guard to run the break” plan as a team strategy or as stat-padding.  I personally think either one is a valid interpretation, but if it is stat-padding, then a lot of players are doing it too.  Also yeah, Westbrook’s numbers in OKC would probably look a lot more like his HOU numbers without Adams (7-8 a game rather than 10-11)"
"I don't get how PGs makes him a villain. PG is a ""villain"" because he wanted to go home. He got convinced to re-sign and when he knew they wouldn't be shit, he requested a trade. A trade that OKC needed to make because they needed an excuse to move on from Russell Westbrook.  He's also a ""villain"" to Laker fans because he turned them down. And Laker fans are like little kids when they see a new shiny toy, if they're told no, they throw tantrums and freak out."
I didnt read all that shit but russell westbrook has the highest defensive rating in the league right now
Jeremy Lin earned a bachelor of arts in economics  Russell Westbrook had a 3.9 GPA  Kelly Olynyk had a bachelor degree is accounting  Victor Oladipo had a degree in sports communication
"The biggest thing with effort is getting through screens or even just trying to make the other team set a good screen. A lot of the high profile ""bad defense"" PGs are guilty of this. Russell definitely is. Kyrie is especially bad with this too.  Most guys will try hard when they are defending someone in an ISO/post up. Its extremely rare to see lack of effort in those situations. But as soon as there is any kind of screen, they just give up and don't try to avoid/fight through it at all. Same players also tend to be lazier about getting back in transition or closing out hard on shooters.  This is also why you see a big discrepancy in how people feel about different players defense. Especially for physically gifted guys like Westbrook. When you watch him guard a player with the ball he can look like an average to good defender, but as soon as hes guarding someone without the ball or gets screened he just stops playing almost. Rondo is the same way except he got even more overrated for a while because he did play defense 10 years ago in his early Celtics years."
"That's just dumb, Lillard is a really light with no calories Curry; Russell Westbrook is not even in the same conversation and Giannis is exposed right now."
Who is this harden westbrook?   Is he related to Russell Westbrook?  Kinda cool that his first name is the same as russ’s MVP Teammate James Harden tho
keep that foulmouth young man Russell Westbrook away from the kids all the games.
This is like saying Russell Westbrook was the best all around player in the league for three years
Russell Westbrook is disgusted with this gross inefficiency

Kyle Lowry with the Russell Westbrook shot
"For the sake of trying to answer your question I think all of these guys at least have an arguments chance against Westbrook: *Bill Russell *Wilt Chamberlain  *Shaq *Hakeem *Kareem *Magic Johnson *John Stockton  *Michael Jordan *Steve Nash *Kobe *Jerry West *Oscar Robertson  *Steph Curry *Kevin Durant *Larry Bird *Lebron *Tim Duncan *Scottie Pippen *D-Wade *Kahwi  *Kevin Garnett  *Harden *Isiah Thomas *Karl Malone *Charles Barkley *Dirk  *CP3 *Elgin Baylor *Dr J *Moses Malone *Giannis  *Iverson *George Mikan (I know, I know) *David Robinson *Brian Scalabrine"
"The 5 most used players from each team for last night's game, from shortest to tallest.  **Houston Rockets**  * Russell Westbrook: 6'3'', 200 lbs, 6'8'' wingspan.  * Eric Gordon: 6'3'', 215 lbs, 6'9'' wingspan.  * James Harden: 6'5'', 220 lbs, 6'9'' wingspan.  * PJ Tucker: 6'5'', 245 lbs, 7'' wingspan.  * Robert Covington: 6'9'', 225 lbs, 7'2'' wingspan.  **Los Angeles Lakers**   * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope: 6'5'', 205 lbs, 6'5.5'' wingspan.  * Danny Green: 6'6'', 215 lbs, 6'10'' wingspan.  * Kyle Kuzma: 6'9'', 220 lbs, 7'0'' wingspan.  * LeBron James: 6'8'', 250 lbs, 7'0'' wingspan.  * Anthony Davis: 6'10'', 253 lbs, 7'6'' wingspan.  Talking about build, the 5 Lakers are only about 5.5 inches longer than the 5 Rockets when it comes to wingspan. Rockets be shorter, but they are not too behind in weight and they are long af."
AD at the 5 is not the lineup to go with against Houston. PJ Tucker cannot handle AD along with protecting the rim against lobs to JaVale McGee. Houston's offense relies on James Harden/Russell Westbrook driving to the rim either for a layup or to collapse the defense and get a wide open 3. Houston also doesn't get destroyed by offensive boards if they are only facing a lineup with AD instead of AD/JaVale.
Russell Westbrook screaming AND-ONE as the universe implodes would be a fine end to it all

"but this time you won't go 0-27 on 3s cuz at about the 0-8 mark, russell westbrook, 2017 mvp, is gonna make something happen."
"Can someone of the fan of Russell Westbrook explain me why they like him?  If the Rockets loose that series I can only say that it is because of him. He take so much bad shot and make a lot of bad turnovers. Moreover he is a liability on defense and cannot spot up shot from 3, so he is very bad match for Harden. The worst of all is that been defended by Lakers bigs he never pass through them..."
The Russell Westbrook Story.
Did you really just compare Russell Westbrook to Steve Nash?
"The core of the rockets team that was up 3-2 on golden state was harden and cp3 lol   The lakers are the favourites because LeBron and AD &gt; Harden and Westbrook.   The rockets third best player is Eric Gordon probably. He can get hot but he’s not really someone you need to be especially afraid of.  All of that said, I hope Houston wins because Russell Westbrook is my favourite player, and the libel against him is unreal."
I think that Russell Westbrook at WR would be almost unstoppable

Yup. And when he got back he was Rusty Westbrook. The Lakers are getting Russell Bestbrook
"Equating Lebron leaving Cleveland for Miami and KD going to a 73 win team is pushing it.   KD has a 3-1 lead in the conference finals, Russell Westbrook, and a great core around him. Lebron has...Mo Williams. Furthermore, it isn’t like Lebron went to the Celtics after losing to them in the playoffs continuously.   Sure, KD has the right to do whatever he wants. Us as fans can also have the right to state what is quite obvious, which is that his path to rings was not difficult and the move ruined the league for 2-3 years."
"PJ Tucker yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Russell Westbrook gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Eric Gordon yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Harden hit the locker room door, former NBA great Lu Dort hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
eh its not like you just roll out any lineup of 5 guards/wings and call it a day... they kinda have james harden and russell westbrook on their team
"I don't know how anyone could say any ream with Russell Westbrook as it's #2 is a title contender, but go ahead. Kd couldn't figure out how to win with Him, George couldn't either but now that they've won one game and beat the thunder in 7, the rockets are contenders...."
"Lol I’m not a Lakers fan. If you look at my most upvoted post of all time, you would see that I am actually a Russell Westbrook fan and am rooting for the Rockets to win.. just pointing out my observations lol thank god for rondo"

From the brilliant mind of Mark Jackson: Russell Westbrook won the MVP because he's good
"1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Giannis Antetekounpo 6. Kevin Durant 7. Damian Lillard 8. Anthony Davis 9. Russell Westbrook 10. Nikola Jokic  People keep saying Curry ""easily"" belongs in the top 10 in today's game but I'd much rather have these players as my number 1 option than Curry. You can laugh at some of these guys but all of these players elevated their team and carried them to the playoffs consistently with a bad roster and also elevated their game in the playoffs.   ""But Curry was unanimous MVP""...MVP is a joke nowadays, otherwise Jordan would have been MVP almost ever year he played in the league, LeBron would have more MVPS, Kobe would have more MVPS, Harden should have won at least 2 more MVPS, etc. MVP for NBA is the best player in the most wins team.   ""Curry has 3 championships, one without Durant""... he also had a stacked team with a deep bench. Like I said in my post, swap Dame for Steph and you won't even see a dropoff, and probably would see more championships for GS.  Problem with Curry is that he can't finish at the rim, and can only drive to the rim because people respect his shot so much. When his shots off, he's just another player on the court to help spread the floor. He can't score at will like what everybody on this board believes.  He's lucky he got injured this year too excuse himself from making the playoffs. Won 1 game last year when he played, and got blown out the other 4 games he lost.   ""He had a terrible team!"" How come he only averaged 20 PPG then? Shouldn't a superstar average 25+ PPG for a bad team that needs their superstar to score? I thought he was going to FEAST now that Durant was gone?"
"Russell westbrook is +6 lol, seems like he is contributing on the steals and defensive end"

"Here's my pitch to make you a Houston Rockets fan:  -Beardology. Our savior has a cool beard. James Harden is known as ""the beard"" and who doesn't love beards? He's also the best scorer since Kobe at least, and arguably since MJ. Some might say KD is better but he's a snake, not a basketball player.  -Russell Westbrook. Many NBA fans say they miss the intensity and athleticism of Michael Jordan. Russ is probably the closest player to the MJ level of intensity. He gives it 110% every time he's on the court.  -Mike D'antoni. MDA is a revolutionary coach, even though he has not gotten over the conference finals hump. He's coached teams that have changed the way the league plays basketball. Whether you enjoy that style of play or not (shooting 3s, only taking high percentage 2s), you cannot deny that the league has slowly but surely adopted his style of play.  -Wings! Do you like wings? How about 3&amp;D (defend well, shoot 3s well) wings? Well then we're the team for you. We have a plethora of 3&amp;D wings that elevate their play with Russ and Harden.  *Slaps Toyota Center* this baby can fit so many 3s inside! You'll always be entertained as a Houston Rockets fan. Except for when we our missing our 3s. But that's a rare occurrence. I wish.  Seriously though, welcome to the NBA. The Jazz, even though I hate them, are a very fun team to watch. You can't go wrong with whoever you choose. It's a fun league and I hope you are happy with whatever team you pick."
"Honestly, I hope Westbrook can make it back for the Rockets series; I was excited to see extreme small ball vs. extreme big ball. And Russell attacking the bigs at like 110%"
"Na the sub does this all the time. LeBron during last dance or when he loses a game, Rudy gobert(I mean he did a stupid but the backlash was just wild), Russell Westbrook when he had that bad run earlier in this season(I consider myself a Westbrook hater but the slander on him was fucking absurd). This subreddit is just filled with reactionary pieces of shit."
He still has OKC and Russell Westbrook in his name so clearly being up to date isn't his thing

"They don't add athleticism like they add other skills, but an NBA player usually doesn't hit their athletic peak until roughly 23-27, so he's probably right that Lula hasn't exactly hit his athletic peak, though he's never going to be Russell Westbrook in that regard"

"Do you understand how TS% works? Honestly asking. If you don’t, just know that the 58 TS% i provided *includes* him shooting 43% from the field and 32% from three. The stuff you’re criticizing is already accounted for.  But hey, if you really want someone to blame for that series look no further than Russell Westbrook. 22 ppg on a ghastly 46 TS%. Let’s blame Paul George though even though he was the far superior player."
I am not gonna be able to deal with these threads when it's Russell Westbrook. I knew I shouldn't have come back to Reddit. Gosh this is gonna suck.
Especially on Russell Westbrook day.
Russell Westbrook and Giannis Antetokounmpo  - Marv Albert
"Nurk doesn’t throw up a runner and brick. What are you watching? His short roll are pretty decisive and he actually can manipulate the defense with the look off before passing to the corner pretty well.  His speed on the these roll is a problem because team would trap Dame beyond the 3 point line and by the time Nurk got the ball they already scram back in better positions, but that’s gonna be the same for Gasol as well if you put him in this situation. Not every team has that Draymond whose speed on the short roll is super quick and with pin point accuracy and read to lure the defense right in for alley oop/ kick out corner 3/ finish the play himself.  There are few guards that get trap beyond the 3 point line: Curry, Harden and now Lillard.  Curry has Draymond, Harden has Westbrook, Lillard  has Nurkic, who’s while not as speedy and as great of playmaker like Draymond and Russell Westbrook, can still be a great release valve in the middle of the floor"
"unasked for novel incoming, but the Olympic team is something i've been thinking a lot about lately.   Don had a monster game against France in the qualifiers, 29 pts, 6 rbs, 4 ast which were all team highs.  The Boston quartet no showed in that particular game.     I brought this up yesterday, but i REALLY hope Don can make the Olympic squad.  Some up and comers need to be groomed to take over.  The '24 games are really going to need guys like Mitchell and Tatum with some experience.  '24 and '28 and the years the current young NBA talent will need to carry the squad.  It's tough to squeeze someone like Mitchell on the team when there are a lot of current guards who are between 30-32 who will want another shot at a gold in 2021 (Lillard, McCollum, Westbrook, Harden, Walker, Curry, Thompson, Wall).  Those guys are blocking the 20-24 years olds who will be the future of the Olympic team (Mitchell, Booker, Fox, Young, Russell, Morant).  Then there is Beal and Irving who are smack dab in the middle of the old guard and new wave in terms of age.     My guess/hope is they'll leave some of the older guys out (probably Wall, maybe Walker, Westbrook, and Thompson, one of McCollum or Lillard), bring in Beal as the guy that's impact ready for '21 and will still be in his prime for '24, and then bring in 1 or 2 of the young guards to learn off of the bench (hopefully Mitchell, and one of Fox, Booker, Young or Russell.  My preference would be Fox or Young, they seem more marketable and humble).  Harden, Curry, Beal, Mitchell, and Fox/Young would be my picks if they went with 5 guards on the 12 man squad.  Fox would be the pick if they want speed, Young if they want shooting.  That 5 with the likes of Durant, Tatum, Davis, Kawhi, Ingram, Towns if he plays for the US, maybe Brown or Zion, seems like a good enough team to at least medal.  Gold is attainable but will be tough unless the US just goes with an all veteran squad.  Center seems like the spot that the US is lacking.  Maybe Bam and Zion will be the next wave but as of now that's a thin spot compared to other top contenders."
"Kevin Durant's ""sacrifice"": 5 years, $86 million  Russell Westbrook's ""sacrifice"": 5 years, $80 million  James Harden's ""big bucks"": 5 years, $60 million  The ego stuff you keep talking about is nonsense. Harden was close with Westbrook and Durant, and was willingly coming off the bench, despite his talent and production.   Comparing Harden's departure to Reggie Jackson's makes zero sense. OKC didn't want to pay Harden max money because they already maxed Westbrook and Durant, and paid Ibaka and Perkins. They were trying to duck the luxury tax. They were penny-pinching.  Jackson clashed with Westbrook and became a locker room problem. Harden did nothing of the sort."
"""superstar""  ""Russell Westbrook""  pick one"
"The Simmons not shooting thing is on Simmons. I'm starting to think that Simmons has a mental block that says he can only shoot from 10 feet or less. We have all seen that he has the abolity to shoot. I know practice and game is a whole different animal, but the way he sinks it in shoot arounds, and the fact that he has decent mechanics says that he could at least make defenders THINK he might shoot it. The main issue with the Sixers is that they are too easy to plan for. They know Simmons isn't gonna shoot, and they know that if he penetrates and kicks it out, there isn't a whole lot to worry about because they dont have hardly anyone that can shoot. Ben Simmons has enough star power that he could get away with shooting from just about anywhere on the court if he feels like it. I know, because I watched Russell Westbrook do it for years! He does so many other things well, that if he would at least try,defenders might not know exactly what he is gonna do"
We still love Westbrook.  Everyday is still Russell Westbrook day in OKC.  It just wasn't working.  I honestly hope Westbrook gets a 30/10/9 game against us while we beat houston by 30.  Watching Houston lose is always satisfying.
"They missed Westbrook so much in this game, because Harden was not fast enough to get by Dort and settled for 3s or kicked out long before he reached the restricted area. Russell would have taken it to the rim and sure as hell got calls or created better looks for the Rockets because he would have drawn help inside."
Funny thing is Mo Cheeks was already the head coach in Philly for like four years but it didn't work out. Still he's been a great assistant and has a knack for coaching and teaching point guards (pretty sure Russell Westbrook said he's had a huge influence on him and helped him take the next step as a player)... I think he'd be a great fit in Philly at least as an assistant.
You realize we have Russell Westbrook on our team right?
"Tell me why I read this 5 times as Bodie, Russell Westbrook lol"
"Russell Westbrook getting sonned by Ricky Rubio in Game 3, vowing he’d “shut that shit down” in Game 4, then getting baited into four fouls before halftime."
Russell Westbrook.
"How is that even being upvoted....   When he scored 48 points on 46 shots? You can't be nice with stats, that's just a hard no.  For context, the entire Raptors team minus Pascal collectively had a TS over .650 for the entire series.  Pascal's .503 would make Russell Westbrook blush."
"It was because of Paul George and Russell Westbrook that Carmelo Anthony couldn't find a team to sign him. They used him as a scapegoat for their problems, then when he left they still lost in the first round. They made him look like an ass hole, when they were the real ass holes the whole time."
"No worries. And as for a bit more history on how team record is really important to the voters, since 76, only two people have won MVP with their team finishing below 50 wins in a season. Moses Malone (did it twice, if you haven't heard of him go look at his history. Dudes a monster). And Russell   Westbrook."
"**2019-20 Season Only:**  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo   2. James Harden   3. LeBron James  4. Kawhi Leonard   5. Luka Doncic   6. Nikola Jokic  7. Anthony Davis   8. Joel Embiid   9. Jayson Tatum   10.

Rudy Gobert   Trae Young May be a bit high. Paul George is lower because of missed games. For the last spot, I hesitated between Siakam, Gobert, and Beal."
"&gt; Very small sample size for this because even people like MJ did 3 years in college. If you compare 21 years old sure, it is one of the greatest, behind only Lebron and Magic Johnson only because of how terrible Luka is on defense.  Nobody is saying any different, but define still ""very small"", when do you believe the sample of almost everyone being in the league by 21 started?  &gt; He has continued the same trend that he has for two years now. Amazing volume stats due to high USG% and Westbrook style uncontested rebounding. However very mediocre on/off stats of actually making the team better. In fact, the team was a net negative statistically whenever he was on the court this playoff series so far.  He is a much much different player this season, last year his main weakness was scoring inside but this season he's been elite at it. He also increased considerably across the board in just about every stat category and his team was one game away from the 4th seed vs missing the playoffs.   &gt; Like I said, volume stats. The same stats that overhype people like Russell Westbrook and Hasan Whiteside and undervalue players like Dennis Rodman and Klay Thompson. Dennis Rodman had terrible DRPM the years he won defensive player of the year lol.  It does definitely miss stuff but it's generally much much more often correct than your use of contextless on/off numbers for individual players lol, that stat is only really useful for 5 man lineups.   btw, even though I still don't like that stat off my head Westbrook had amazing on/off numbers during his best years in OKC"
"&gt; Luke is an all time great for a 21 year old  Very small sample size for this because even people like MJ did 3 years in college. If you compare 21 years old sure, it is one of the greatest, behind only Lebron and Magic Johnson only because of how terrible Luka is on defense.  &gt;he's now especially getting hyped over how ridiculously well he's played  He has continued the same trend that he has for two years now. Amazing volume stats due to high USG% and Westbrook style uncontested rebounding. However very mediocre on/off stats of actually making the team better. In fact, the team was a net negative statistically whenever he was on the court this playoff series so far.  &gt; there is a reason why Luka had the 9th highest RPM in the league  Like I said, volume stats. The same stats that overhype people like Russell Westbrook and Hasan Whiteside and undervalue players like Dennis Rodman and Klay Thompson. Dennis Rodman had terrible DRPM the years he won defensive player of the year and it was some of the best defensive years of the best defensive player of all time.  &gt; There's a lot that happens on the floor that just isn't captured by basketball reference  One thing that isn't captured is the on/off numbers of how much you make the team better or worse when you are on and for two regular seasons and the tiny playoff series of 4 games so far, Doncic has very mediocre to even bad on/off numbers.  I value players like Giannis, Lebron and Kawhi who make teams better on both sides of the ball and have amazing on/off numbers and not volume stats guys like Whiteside and Westbrook that don't. The only exception is really amazing shooters like Curry and Nash who have such good offensive on/off that they don't need defense. Luka has below average 3% and below average ft% two years in a row now and don't think he will ever get close to their level."
I think ever since the Russell Westbrook incident things amplified.
Watchu taking about man- Russell Westbrook
"Imagine drafting Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden back-to-back-to-back (also Serge Ibaka) and not only *not* getting even a single championship out of it, but don't have a single one of those guys on your current roster."
Russell Westbrook said this about Patrick Beverly but about his defense. Saying he doesn't guard anyone he's just running around doing nothing.
Russell Westbrook has extraordinary swag that you BAWBs wouldn’t understand. Giannis doesn’t.
He’s (pretty much) the reigning 2-time MVP and he made roughly the same endorsement money that Russell Westbrook made last year.
"Locks are: Lebron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Pau Gasol, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antekoumpo, Marc Gasol, Carmelo Anthony, and Luka Doncic.  Guys that probably get in are Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Derrick Rose.  Guys that might get in are Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Al Horford, and Andre Iguodala.  Everyone else is too early in their career to get a good idea, or isn’t really on a good path for the hall of fame."
Luka “Russell Westbrook” Doncic
Either Russell Westbrook was the main reason Paul George was in MVP consideration until his shoulder injury.  OR his shoulder is actually still fucked up.  But I’m guessing the former.
Eh. Almost that entire 5:58 was facing the rockets without Russell Westbrook AND Harden.
"James Harden and Russell Westbrook wouldn’t work together, also the rockets defense being worse after small ball"
"&gt;in the last 5 years, 40 teams have made it past the second round which is more then PG had done.   Basketball is played 5 on 5 not 1 v 1  &gt;Really scoring 5 points on 12.5% shooting in an elimination game with 6 TOV isn’t that big a deal? what about 15 on 23% shooting?   Paul George against the Blazers - 28 ppg on 58 TS%  Westbrook against the Blazers - 22 ppg on 46 TS%  It is 100% illogical to blame Paul George for Russell Westbrook playing like shit.  &gt;Lmao, my name is literally STEVE NASHTEY, you really think i don’t know anything about team basketball? get outta here ya troll  This means literally nothing."
Russell Westbrook.
[Charania] *Russell Westbrook will return to the lineup for game 4*
"Ok, then I think you're just wrong. How can you think that you've seen enough out of a player who has improved year after year after year, with no sign of stagnation, at only age 22? He's nowhere near the point that players typically plateau, I'd expect to see him get better again next season.  Look at where guys like Russell, Beal, LaVine, Curry, Westbrook, Lillard, Kyrie were at age 22 and where they are now. You're not thinking clearly if you think that Fox is finished developing."
I had a dream I had to guard Russell Westbrook last night. He cooked me.

" Russell Westbrook and James Harden are very good basketball players (I hate James Harden's playing style, but I'll give him his due), but neither are THAT guy. How much more evidence do people need?"
"How can you see stuff like “Russell Westbrook will make 43.8 million a year for the next 3 years” and not actually openly hope for the salary cap to plummet due to covid, a new tv deal, or a renegotiated CBA. The NBA getting these massively inflated contracts from the TV deal is a bigger ponzi scheme than the stock market."

PLEASE LEARN TO NOT SHOOT THAT RUSSELL FUCKING WESTBROOK.
"Hey Rockets,   Playing with more energy does not mean hand the ball over to the turnover machine Russell Westbrook 😂"
"12 years on and WB is still trying to shoot 3s like has he really learned nothing or does he just not care about sinking every team he plays for?    Russell ""The Anchor"" Westbrook."
"Half court offence is the most important part of playoff basketball imo. I think Bud needs to go he doesnt adjust, he relegates Giannis to pure screener way too often in the half court, he is playing Giannis, Middleton and Lopez way too few minutes.  Giannis needs to sort out his FT shooting in this offseason or he will continue to struggle in the playoffs. Hes basically 7ft Russell Westbrook at the moment taking way too many 3s.  The Heat dont have a super star but their half court offence is really good, multiple players can create their own shot/get to the rim/get to the line consistently. Spoelstra has done a great job utilising his shooters in hand offs and back screens to create open looks for them too."
"He got badly exposed because he has little in the bag offensively if he can't get right to the rim or get out and run in transition. He needs to get much much better in the half-court.  As for worst first option of all-time, i can't say that. It felt an awful lot like watching Demar Derozan and Russell Westbrook so i guess there is hope."
What assets you think an aging Russell Westbrook on THAT contract is going to get them?  They're more likely to have to attach picks like they did with CP3 (except I doubt they have any left they can trade) than pick up any truly valuable assets from the team taking on that deal.
Russell Westbrook was a significant downgrade from Chris Paul and Morey got fleeced.

Came to say this. If it meant Kawhi staying then I think Masai makes the deal but there was no guarantee Kawhi would stay even if they did it and getting stuck holding the bag of Paul George and Russell Westbrook with no picks or depth would have been a disaster.
"Lmao. Like what are we doing? This is the lengths we are going to in order to shame Westbrook? He can’t make players shoot better. Rockets have spacing with or without him. He’s objectively an elite passer. Shooters miss shots.  Harden isoing and missing stepbacks in the worst stretch of his career is not the fault of Russell Westbrook.   And no, they shouldn’t be. Harden averaged 36 points last year and the result was the same. One player production has proven to be a problem, how many points is he averaging in this series? And the Lakers are arguably the best team in the NBA. The Houston Rockets are NOT more talented than the Lakers or the Clippers. They WERE supposed to lose. They WERE NOT favored.   This is a witch hunt. People don’t actually know why the Rockets are losing and just quickly go to #blamewestbrook without any actual thought put into it."
"Supposed you've taken 10 3s and made 3 of those (so 30% 3pt shooting).  TS = 9pts/(2*10) = 45% efficiency  For 45 percent shooting, let's take 9 3s from 20 shots  TS = 27/(2*20) = 67.5% efficiency  To be 30% efficiency you'd have to be shooting 20%! Russell westbrook is a career 30% 3pt shooter!"
"""Russell Westbrook is beside himself. Driving around the bubble in a golf cart begging (through texts) Mike Dan Tony  for a place to dump his substantial collection of VHS pornography"""
"i agree that the raptors were absolutely being used for leverage. but kawhi, pg and russ are definitely better than kawhi and siakim. even pg and russ would’ve been better on the roster than siakim and draft pick.   from the [reports](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2844408-woj-raptors-rejected-russell-westbrook-paul-george-for-pascal-siakam-trade.amp.html) i read the offer from okc was pg13 and westbrook go to toronto in return for siakim, fvv and four unprotected draft picks. masai absolutely would’ve taken that deal if okc was serious about it. ofc masai was smart enough to realize that okc would never go through it since the clippers had more assets, but it’s false to say the raptors didn’t want it.   you’re also underestimating pg13. his two years at okc were his best playoff seasons, and he would easily do well in the eastern conference. not to mention him taking the pacers to multiple ecfs against lebron’s heats.   that being said, the trade never would’ve happened anyways, so no use talking about that. honestly tho, if siakim cannot get himself together it doesn’t matter what his and masai’s relationship is. he traded derozan to get kawhi in the first place, after all."
"The Heatles didn't have Russell Westbrook on a supermax as well as Kawhi and PG on maxs. Wade, Bosh and LeBron all took less money, and even with that they still lost in year 1 and struggled with reloading. And, they didn't have to give up significant pieces and assets for Bosh and LeBron, unlike the Raptors who would have had to give up Siakam FVV and 4 1at rounders for just PG let alone what we would have had to give up for Russ."
"No. Especially when we would have to give up more than just Siakam. We would have to give up a STUPID amount of players and picks for Russ and PG13.  As a Raptors fan, I would prefer riding this Raptors incarnation out over trading our entire future for Russell Westbrook and Paul George."
Just a reminder that Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were 22 and 23 yrs old in 2012...
"James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Joel Embiid: https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/174/veggie.jpg"

Fastest rocket? Eat your heart out Russell Westbrook!
"Shot 42% from three point range and it took 82 shots for him to get 91 points.  Gross.  E: Also, you’re moving the goalpost. No, the alternative is not roll over and die. No one said there should be an alternative.  He was neutralized by Rudy Gobert at the rim. That is the discussion we are having. Not “should Russell Westbrook have taken most of the shots on the 2018 OKC Thunder or nah”."
Both teams suddenly turned into Russell Westbrook
"Was it? The team was built to maximize westbrook because they knew harden had a higher floor. Harden was averaging 38 ppg earlier this year when he had gone threat capela on the roster (which btw, the harden to capela connection was the most occurring 1-2 in the league). But Russell needed the spacing to maximize his drives"
You’re saying a lot of ifs and hypotheticals but terry Rozier is not a better basketball player than Russell Westbrook period
"It’s not that the rockets aren’t making adjustments. It’s the the players can’t capitalize. Time and time again, I’ve seen Westbrook/Gordon/Rivers get the ball after harden gets doubled and they can play 4v 3 but they either a) can’t beat their man b) don’t swing the ball or c) (mainly Russell here) lose their dribble and give the d time to reset.   Jeff green and roco have been really good getting plays out of our double team but when the rockets other ball handlers aren’t capitalizing, there’s nothing much they can do gameplan wise."
Terry Rozier &gt; Russell Westbrook  It got upvoted too
"I could write about superteams until I reach the limit. I might write a longer post if demand for this kind of thing is high.  **I think I understand the pain of losing a superstar who you hoped would come to define sports in your city.** It sucks in every way imaginable. It sucks for the guy who left because it damages his brand. It sucks for the guys he's joining because he looks like a mercenary. It sucks for the city he's leaving because they *thought* they were progressing through the pain and glory. It sucks for the city he's entering because they won't understand the pain and glory. This is a phenomenon unique to the NBA: The careers are longer than other sports. The stars are cooler than other sports. (NASCAR fan, can confirm.) You can build a roster faster than in other sports.  **But, rings matter in the NBA.** Was KD gonna win a chip playing alongside Russell Westbrook? No, and now KD will probably be remembered as one of the greatest players of all time. Russ will be remembered as Hot Iverson.  Would LeBron have won a title if he'd stayed in Cleveland? (I could write a book on that.) Sure. But, as much as I cringed at the way he left (and his, um, track record *after* he left), you have to understand that Cleveland made a mistake: When you have a talent like LeBron, you let him make the decisions. You let him run the show. You're Cleveland. If LeBron wants to run the show, you let him run the show. Sure, he made you sign his friends to untradeable contracts and left you high and dry with them *after* you let Carlos Boozer go, but c'mon. You are never getting a chance like this ever again. (Again, I find LeBron's tenure in Miami to be a major disappointment. You let a team with Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Jerry Stackhouse, Mike Bibby, Eddie House, Udonis Haslem and -- eventually -- Shane Battier and RAY FREAKING ALLEN lose to *who*? The *Old Mavs? The Summertime Spurs? Really?* MJ forever, man.)  **Is the quality of the game going down? Yeah, it is. We probably have too many teams.** Do we really need franchises in Sacramento, Charlotte, New Orleans, Orlando, Minneapolis, Inglewood, Memphis, OKC, *and* Denver/Phoenix/Salt Lake City? Most of those franchises I just named are *hopeless* in the superteam era anyway. What are you gonna do, send missionaries to the bubble and build a superteam in Utah? (No offense.) You wanna talk about ratings? What if we didn't have hundreds of thousands of people tuning in to watch the Timberwolves face the freaking Magic while Friday Primetime was on? Is it crazy to suggest that some of these should have to play in broad daylight until they turn into something worth watching? And, honestly, why would you even *watch* the NBA if you lived in some of these places? You have *no hope of a championship*. Not today, not tomorrow, and probably not ever. Your superstars hate living there -- even though some of the smarter players are gonna start leaving Cali for Minnesota when the climate science hits their desks. That's probably why KD and Kyrie moved to a cold weather city. ""Hey Kyrie, I might see what's what in LA."" ""Kevin -- the wildfires are only gonna get worse. You're gonna wake up and think you missed the rapture."" ""Okay, New York it is.""  **Are ratings going down? Yep.** Look, fans don't have the connection with players in terms of city that they used to. LeBron James could've made Akron his throne. The same goes for Kyrie and Boston, Kawhi in San Antonio, and various other talented players. Instead we're left with, like, Steph Curry, who is awesome, and Damian Lilliard, who is awesome, and Kyle Lowry, who is breathtaking, and, like, Luka. The facade has largely been torn away. The fans can't bring themselves to care about the players. The players can't bring themselves to care about the fans. What happened in KC was real. Do you really expect a player to love *that*? You really expect a player to be loyal to *that?* Are you effing kidding me? But, at the same time, the fans aren't going to be as loyal to the players when that bond is shattered, so ratings are gonna go down. NY and LA were watching basketball anyway, so for all these guys to cloister in those cities is a bad business decision long-term.  Kobe's brand was linked inextricably to Los Angeles. That's *his* city. Paul Pierce's brand -- while it's nowhere near Kobe's -- was linked inextricably to Boston. AI's brand was linked to Philadelphia. And don't get me started about Jordan, or Magic, or Bird, or Wilt, or the great Mr. William Russell. Frankly, (and this is not my original idea, I think it was Clark Kellogg) teams should be allowed to offer players a stake in the team. LeBron James should own the Cavaliers. Damian Lilliard should have a stake in the Blazers. Tatum &amp; Brown should have some level of decision-making power at the Celtics in a concrete way. Certain players should be making decisions, cutting checks, and reaping profits at the executive level. You want to solve the diversity problem in sports boardrooms in a way that doesn't dilute the accomplishments of minority execs? Boom. There you go.  The superteam is here to stay. Teams in bad markets have no way to make players' lives better in the current environment. Players in bad markets with bad teams and bad execs will not -- and should not -- stay in those markets. I've barely scratched the surface, and I know that other people have thoughts on stuff like this as well."
But you've got James Harden and Russell Westbrook? /s
And Westbrook says his only friend is [basketball](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-playoffs-russell-westbrook-basketball-is-only-friend-on-court-james-harden/x4obcgj4mhlv1ndvei7ptmsj6)
something something James Harden Russell Westbrook
"Yes it does. CP3 and Lebron/Rondo do it *for* the coaches because they instill in the players around them what’s at stake. Russell Westbrook and Harden don’t have that kind of leadership qualities so it’s up to Dantoni to reinforce it.  Keep in mind this is a SMALL BALL team. Usually the true 4’s and 5’s have this instilled into their routine since HS/College, these kind of players need to actively think and be reminded for this system to work."
Last night I drank everytime I thought Russell Westbrook made a bad play and ended up in the hospital
both Russell and Harden are past their primes. Harden peaked in 2017. you guys remember when he was quite unbeatable at the rim? his drives to the rims were insane and his ability to get a bucket through contact was crazy.  now he just dances on somone steps back and shoots a 3. hes not in the same shape hes older.   Westbrook. same thing. he relied so much on his speed and phsyicality. h cant do it the same anymore
**THE WORLD HAS ADVANCED BEYOND THE NEED FOR RUSSELL WESTBROOK AND JAMES HARDEN**
Russell Westbrook is not a superstar man he's a top 20 player.
james harden and russell westbrook have always been playoff chokers. not sure what people expected from this team lol
Yet Russell Westbrook won mvp with his lame ass team.

"All-NBA Anti-Spacing Team: Russell Westbrook, Lonzo Ball, Ben Simmons, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steven Adams"
I’m sick of Russell Westbrook (who isn’t a fucking shooter) being the best shooter on his playoff teams
"Kobe had a pretty good year. Him getting 4th is a pretty bad snub considering:  —He averaged 35, 5,  and 4.5 on a team with nobody and took them to the 7 seed in a tough Western Conference and took the Suns to 7 games in round 1. Steve Nash averaged 19 and 11 that year on the way to the MVP.   —Averaged 43ppg in January and 41ppg in April.   —Scored 81 in a game. Probably even more impressive considering the difference in pace compared to today’s game. For reference: during that season, teams failed to score 81 points on 206 occasions.   —27 40-point games.   —First team all-defense. First team all-NBA.   So usually I would agree that the best player on the best team should get the award... unless there’s a player doing historic shit as the alpha dog on a playoff team (see: Russell Westbrook).  But I’m biased, so take that with a grain of salt."
"Bullshit, James harden and Russell Westbrook fans have personal beef with the warriors for an actual reason: they get their shit wrecked every time they play the warriors in the playoffs"
"Man, I'm glad I'm not a rockets fan. They really just burned their future for Westbrook, Covington, etc ...   Does anyone have a summary of how fucked they are in the next few years? All for a second round exit to the Lakers. Gotta love it   1st rounders gone in 2024, 2026, pick swaps in 2021 and 2025 just for Russell Westbrook. And it's obvious CP3 is the better player (barring health obviously)... God that's a worse trade than the KG and Pierce move because honestly, westbrook sucking was way easier to predict than that near superteam nets team falling flat and having a vet KG have to carry them out of the first round lmao ...   They sent away their 2020 pick for Cov lol   Am I missing anything ?"

"Alex Caruso, former redditor &gt; Russell Westbrook, former star player."
Alex Caruso &gt; Russell Westbrook.  This is not even a joke.
"This is really hard for me to admit on here (but also don't look at my post history to call me out for being a hypocrite)  I actually feel bad for Russell Westbrook. Like, his game relies so heavily on his athleticism and that's just gonna go away the older he gets. If him being in Houston wasn't enough for him to grow as a player and mature his game, I really don't know how bad it's going to be for the remainder of his career."
"Rockets went ""all in"" for Russell fucking Westbrook? That's the funniest shit ever"
hahahahahahaHAHAHAHA  a RUSSELL WESTBROOK THREE POINTER was the BEST SHOT the rockets could manage with the shot clock off at the end of the quarter? fucking hell. call the series now

Alex Caruso with ~~as many~~ more points ~~as~~ than Russell Westbrook. Completely abysmal.
Are these State farm commercials a straight up attack on Russell Westbrook or am I missing something.
"It was a rainy night in Atlanta. 11th of July, 2019. I was outside my girlfriend's apartment, ready to have a great night with dinner. Everything was perfect.  I park and check my phone before going inside. That was when I saw it.  Blockbuster trade: CP3 traded for Russell Westbrook. I never did make it to that dinner, I spent it in my car. Crying. The rain never did stop that night. And now, it feels like a thundercloud has hung over me ever since."

"when brian davis made that comment about russell westbrook being ""out of his cotton-picking mind"", it was wrong because the origin of that statement clearly has racial undertones  the symbol of a noose is *not* exclusive to black plight  remember this [burberry hoodie](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt_e9OpgGG3/?utm_source=ig_embed) that they displayed on a runway for shock value and to trigger a reaction?  when most people think of a noose, it's associated with ***SUICIDE*** first and foremost  if you want to make it about american history, at least know what you're talking about  &gt;[Lynchings in the United States first became common in the Southern United States in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, at which time most of the victims were white men.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lynching_in_the_United_States)  not to mention the salem witch trials two centuries before that... this is taught in elementary school  if you truly hate racism, STOP.

"Kyle is an interesting case, man. He's been top 10 in several advanced stats for something like seven years. The Raptors have been continually over-achieving relative to their other players. They even won a Championship with the guy carrying them in Game 6 in the Finals. Now he's carrying a team with their nominal first option choking hard.  But he usually doesn't have the scoring stats and he's not a sexy name, so people think he's not an all-decade player.   It is a damn crime that he's only been on one All-NBA (third) team. To make you realize how big of a crime this is, look at the [announced votes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMzwRcilLDej0BWl7eYE_OYC9Tx9olI_Ptn-nHjKfpQ/edit#gid=1452445687) from this year. These guards are all above Lowry; Damian Lillard. Russell Westbrook. Khris Middleton. Ben Simmons.   How are their teams doing? Did they have more help than a broken Siakam?  Or look at last year; Dwyane Wade, D'Angelo Russell, Demar Derozan, Mike Conley, Klay Thompson were all above Lowry in voting.  Just ridiculous. The man is the most underrated star in the NBA _by far_. Carrying the Raptors on the back like maybe five -- three? -- other players in the NBA could.   Let's be honest, if this was Lillard's, Westbrook's, Middleton's or Simmons' Raptors they would already be out."

Most inconsistent player of the playoffs - Russell Westbrook or Paul George?
He's not a good defender because Russell Westbrook said a funny quote months ago - r/nba
Jayson “Russell Westbrook” Tatum
Jayson “Russell Westbrook” Tatum
Russell Westbrook  Andre Roberson   Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Steven Adams
Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler  Draymond Green  Anthony Davis  Bam Adebayo
Pick better players   Russell Westbrook   Jimmy Butler   Ben Simmons   Giannis   Montrezl Harrell   Would this team win a title now that would be a question I would want to see answered
1. Marcus Smart  2. Russell Westbrook  3. Jimmy Butler  4. Draymond Green  5. Joel Embiid  Team All-Ego would never lose a game
Imagine if the Thunder swing a blockbuster trade for PG. Then all they would have to do is trade Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook. That team would be sick!
"Turning Paul George and Russell Westbrook into 7 first-round picks and 4 pick swaps (and likely more after they trade CP3), while leveraging a player they didn’t have on the roster (Kawhi) and clashing stars (Harden &amp; CP3), is a pretty genius move. And the picks they got are up to 6 years into the future, when those teams could very easily be rebuilding. There’s no reason to assume all those picks are going to be in the 20s."
It was a Russell Westbrook quote about Patrick Beverley talking about him not being as good a defender as people think. That was the opening of the quote.
Still. The fact that *Russell Westbrook* can’t beat kuz off the dribble bods terribly got the rockets
"CP3 was definitely interested in getting traded out of OKC, then and now.   &gt; The Oklahoma City Thunder explored trades for Chris Paul after the team acquired him in the July deal that sent Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets, though none materialized. And one of the teams Paul reportedly had interest in was the Milwaukee Bucks.  He accepted his fate when he realized his contract made it impossible. Iguodala did not have a similar issue with his contract."
"Andrew Wiggins  Russell Westbrook in my opinion has a very low IQ and an INMENSE talent  Dwight Howard and Javale are caught a lot with silly  fouls, goaltendings and 3 second violations.  I read somewhere that Dwight made more goaltendings in one season than Tim Dincan on his entire career"
"But harden does all of the things you just mentioned, he runs pick and pops, he runs the pick and roll. He did this a lot when capella was there and he even does it now with Jeff Green and Russell Westbrook at times.  Wheres your evidence that majority of Lebrons points are scored in non iso situations? Because nba.com disagrees with you and ranks Lebron as the second best iso scorer in the 2018 season, the second best iso scorer in the 2017 season and the best ISO scorer in the 2016 season.   Lebron does a bit of everything of course but isolation is a bit part of his game. He had an iso frequency of 30.7% in 2018, 23.3 % in 2017 and 23.3% in 2016. This year hes at 20.1% so far. Its all right here: https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?SeasonType=Playoffs"
"You really are all about projecting aren't you?  After pulling the ""you've never watched card"" and then exposing your own ignorance you're now pulling the ""you've never played"" card while exposing your own inexperience.    You've never played any sport at all at a competitive level if you think that sort of play is a sign of extraordinary high IQ.  Who can forget the great defensive minds like:  * [Ja Morant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai3ASabrlxU)  * [Blake Griffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2NPIM-u0ME)  * [Allonzo Trier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9dlkBLLZfQ)  * [John wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4POePJavosk)  * [Giannis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlnHZhQY8bg)  * [Russell Westbrook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2gWRU48zM)  It's an athletic play, that you typically see from athletic players.   I'm not saying it's a bad play, or that it doesn't highlight LeBron's brilliant defensive ability. I'm just saying it doesn't highlight his defensive IQ, which it clearly doesn't."
"Lol you really saying Russ didn't shoot OKC out of games in the fourth quarter with his ISO ball, even when KD was there? You seriously saying Russell Westbrook saw himself as second fiddle to Durant? Come on, that dude bled for your team you should know him better by now"
"Eric Gordon extension, Russ trade, firing MDA. I won't mention Morey because I know he resigned but bad moves and choices in a franchise lead to implosions. Implosions like every face of your franchise not named Harden and Tillman wanting out.  You don't give up 3 potential picks 4 years down the road with light protections for an aging, battered Russell Westbrook with a bad contract. It was a bad contract then, it's a bad contract now. It was a bad trade then and it's a bad trade now. If you guys had only given up one pick and one swap I'd be willing to concede that with nuance it wasn't that bad of a trade. Russ played great for you guys in the regular season. But you guys leveraged your future for him. That was always going to bite you in the ass unless you won the whole damn thing.  We're going to move his contract and get an asset. We'll see in a couple of days, but I bet we come out with more than just a salary swap. We aren't losing a pick without getting an asset back of equal value. Because we have a well run franchise."
Look at these names and their level of play and age when they were paired with Harden. All of them were HOF caliber guys who were often hurt and declined. And Imagine thinking Russell Westbrook is against isolation play.
It's incredible how much more I like the Thunder now than when it was the Russell Westbrook show with Billy Donovan making an attempt at coaching
We can offer you 1 #6 pick for that Russell Westbrook.
"""It is my nature,"" the scorpion said to the frog.  I don't know why anyone would expect Russ to be anything other than Russell Westbrook. This is a dude that often didn't want to let Kevin fucking Durant take game winners when the game was on the line, preferring instead to take his own contested iso 3 when he can barely hit them at 30%.   It's not necessarily a knock on him, either. He's a ball dominant player who's used that fire to propel him to a legendary first ballot hall of fame career. You just got to build around him if you want him on your team. He ain't gonna be second fiddle. He doesn't even want to be 1a when it comes to scoring. Whether that leads to a championship...."
Russel Westbrook if his name wasn’t wasn’t Russell Westbrook: Rusty Eastbrook
"&gt;I'm a fan of an organization that doesn't make ridiculous moves like trading Chris ""2nd Team All-NBA"" Paul, 2 lightly protected first rounders and pick swaps for Russell Westbrook  Yeah, you're a fan of the team **who traded Jeremy Lamb and Kevin Martin for James Harden**  &gt;Chris ""2nd Team All-NBA"" Paul, 2 lightly protected first rounders and pick swaps for Russell Westbrook   This irked me, because people ignore (sometime purposefully) the context of trading CP3 and use hindsight to make fun of the Rockets.   He wasn't 2nd team level when we traded him, and you know that.  Thankfully the league took a multi-month break, right around the time he starts to show his wear and tear."
I can't wait to watch a bunch of Knick fans unironically say they wouldn't give up Frank for Russell Westbrook.  That'll be fun.
"I’m 99% sure I’ve replied this exact comment to you before  If we, after finally accepting a tank, trade for Russell Westbrook, I am straight up done and I have sat through hundreds of boring ass weeknight games of mediocre basketball for 10 years now"
"10 years of keeping great players around isn't anything close to a failure. No one retires with the team that drafted them anymore. If the next go around is similar to our last then I will be incredibly happy to be an OKC Thunder fan. Luckily, I'm a fan of an organization that doesn't make ridiculous moves like trading Chris ""2nd Team All-NBA"" Paul, 2 lightly protected first rounders and pick swaps for Russell Westbrook so I feel good going forward with what we've got."
The media said Russell Westbrook wants out of Houston
"Yeah because if there’s one thing that Russell Westbrook is known for, it’s building winning cultures"
"Russell Westbrook turned to Tilman Fertitta and said “you need me, you f’ing need me”"

russell westbrook
[source] Houston wants out of Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook is literally a destroyer of teams. KD ran from him. PG13 ran from him and now he's destroyed the Rockets after being there for only one year. Russell Westbrook is who y'all thought Terrell Owens was:  Team Obliterator  Harden will end up on a new team next season because Westbrook once again destroyed a roster with his play style.
"No Russell Westbrook Day in Houston, though, innit?"
#ARON BAYNES / RUSSELL WESTBROOK SUPER TEAM INCOMING
Houston probably wants out of Russell Westbrook too.
Knicks legend Russell Westbrook
This is beautiful. One of the few good posts on this sub. Well done. I would like to submit Warussell Currybrook. A mash up of Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook.
"nah, it's a bit different than what you're thinking of. Oubre's personality and actions are like a less serious version of Russell Westbrook. Plays hard, a bit weird, loves fashion, and always tries to make a big splash. Doesn't seem like the type or personality that Doncic would gel with, but they're professionals. I'm sure they'll make it work. One thing's for sure, Oubre becomes a fan favorite wherever he goes."
"The problm with the rockets, they need a point guard.  You had Chris Paul but James Harden's solo act chased him off.  Now your left two two solo acts and no center.  Here's your future, nobody's being traded.  Your going to get into the playoffs and go down in flames.  Russell Westbrook will be 32 tomorrow.  The future is dark, just get used to it."
James Harden and Russell Westbrook are going to stick together. So you can toss Philly out of the equation unless they want to trade for both which would require getting rid of both EMbiid and Simmons
"[McMahon says differently](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30296437/sources-james-harden-russell-westbrook-concerned-direction-houston-rockets)    &gt; Both stars were consulted during the Rockets' coaching search and were on board with hiring Silas, sources said. &gt;  &gt; Harden, who has said publicly several times that he hopes to play the remainder of his career in Houston, has expressed similar urgency in the past several offseasons about improving the Rockets' chances to win a championship. He remains engaged in discussions with Houston's front office about potential personnel moves this offseason, sources said."

Ya and a problem is having russell westbrook on your team.
"Man, what the fuck are the Knicks doing...I swear to god if we give up draft picks for Russell Westbrook I'm gunna fuckin lose it."
"I mean, what did we think was going to happen? They lost their long time coach and GM now. Everyone sees the writing on the wall, its rebuild time. They tried everything, even trading for Westbrook, none of it got them to the finals. They were a great organization for what, 7 straight years? Time to wrap it up.  I don't think they'll immediately break up the team before the season starts, I fully expect them to give the new coach a chance, but these constant Russell rumors make it seem that if they get the right package, he's gone and there's no point in Harden staying there to just put up numbers.  It was a great run, once Dantoni and Morey decided it was time to leave, this whole thing was over."
Russell Westbrook is damn near the only reason you small ball lineup worked AT ALL. Him grabbing boards and being able to attack the lane with more space was the lifeblood of the smallball offense. Harden just continued what he normally would do and westbrook feasted from Jan-March
"He was traded for Russell Westbrook, he wasn't given away."
"The Oklahoma City Thunder have agreed to trade Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets for Chris Paul, first-round picks in 2024 and 2026, pick swaps in 2021 and 2025, league sources tell ESPN."
*Russell Westbrook*? I thought Presti said *Sterusselph Currybrook*!!
"He doesn’t need to be a 6th man to contribute most effectively to a championship team smh. Russell Westbrook is very good at basketball. It’s not a myth, a meme or a misperception. He is good. Above all else, he absolutely needs to fix his bad habit of taking bad shots. Until he does that he wont be contributing as best he can, but does that relegate him to a 6-man? Absolutely not. At a certain point he does need to honestly assess his careers shortcomings when it comes to winning and fix his apparent stubbornness when it comes to his clearly delusional belief in his shot making ability."
Russell Westbrook is Al Pacino   Gilbert Arenas is Joe Pesci
"It really depends on who ends up where.   My first pick would be LaMarcus Aldridge. He was 34 this year.... out with injury. I don't expect much form him next year.  Frankly surprised he was still putting up 19/7ish this year.   My next pick would be DeMar DeRozen. If he's still with the Spurs, he'll likely get the ball a lot and keep up his numbers, but if he goes somewhere as a third option, I anticipate a steep drop.  On that not... I certainly expect a dip for Andrew Wiggins.   I'm curious to see where Russell Westbrook ends up. I feel like he's about to start bouncing around from team to team like Melo and Iverson did... and it won't be good for his career."
By this logic playoff Russell Westbrook couldn’t play in today’s game
This is known as the reverse Russell Westbrook
&gt; He plays so aggressively he could just be getting a breather on trips to the line whereas earlier in his career he probably was less fatigued.   This appeared to be a cop out and the I think Russell Westbrook supporters upvoted you accordingly. Westbrook is what people thought iverson was but worse.
Everyone asking why the Clippers would do this forget that Paul George was top 3 in mvp voting next to Russell Westbrook.
"It is interesting the last 24 hours. I did have multiple sources that I trust tell me that teams believe Russell Westbrook could be had—that Westbrook could be had—and I've heard the Clippers have interest, I've heard the Knicks have interest in Westbrook, and whether anything materializes there, who knows? Who knows? But the fact is that there is a belief that a guy like Westbrook could become available.""  As per as Kevin o connor podcast"
The Russell Westbrook New York rumors are a constant thing   Only reason I posted was the clippers are somewhat new news
"&gt;Did you see Pierces clutch stats earlier? I don’t know what Melo has but I’d bet Pierce is better.  And your bet would be wrong.  &gt;What’s impressive about Anthony is how he maintained the shooting percentage with such a high volume of attempts.  &gt;The former Syracuse basketball great is one of only seven players to take over 100 “hero shots” since 2004-2005. LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Joe Johnson, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant and Dwyane Wade were the others.  &gt;Only Anthony, James, Johnson and Durant shot above that 30 percent average.  &gt;Anthony has the highest shooting percentage of that group of seven, but took fewer shots than everyone but Joe Johnson.  [source](https://www.syracuse.com/orangebasketball/2019/08/clutch-factor-finds-carmelo-anthony-is-one-of-the-best-at-big-shots.html)"
Aaron Gordon is nowhere near a good enough return for Russell Westbrook
Someone said earlier Cam Newton is Russell Westbrook
"Yeah, just because he played second fiddle doesn’t mean his usage wasn’t also extremely high. The Rockets are top heavy. And no, that is not 30, 10, and 10, nor is he as efficient ...   There IS a decent drop in his athleticism. You implied it was the same, when it’s not. And this is coming from someone who has watched him nonstop for the last 8+ years lmao.   His drop off comes from his athleticism dropping, his shooting dropping, and his free throw form dropping completely. He’s down in every advanced stat by a huge margin, he objectively did not have the same impact.   You can’t try to tell a Thunder fan about Russell Westbrook stick to the Pistons lmao"
Who was the final assist to give Russell Westbrook the triple double record?
"Ok let’s go through it   First, here’s the league average TS% from all the years so we can get a baseline for what’s efficient and what’s not:  2017: 55.2  2016: 54.1  2015: 53.4  2014: 54.1  2013: 53.5  2012: 52.7  2011: 54.1  2010: 54.3  Russell Westbrook in 10-11  Regular season = 22/5/8 on on 54% TS  Playoffs = 24/5/6 on 50% TS  So he was league average efficiency, and in the playoffs he went to -4%. Also his assists dropped and turnovers went up. That = bad playoff run    Westbrook in 11-12  Regular season = 24/5/6 on 54% TS  Playoffs = 23/6/6 on 51% TS  So again he’s average efficiency in the regular season but it drops off -3% in the playoffs   In 12-13 he gets hurt, so lets move on (but in game 2 he was 10-26)    Westbrook in 13-14  Regular season (46 games) = 22/6/7 on 55% TS  Playoffs = 27/7/8 on 54% TS  So this is one year he actually did get better in the playoffs, so I’ll give him that   Westbrook in 15-16   Regular season = 24/8/10 on 55% TS  Playoffs = 26/7/11 on 52% TS   So -3% efficiency again   Westbrook in 16-17  Regular = 32/11/10 on 55% TS   Playoffs = 37/12/11 on 51% TS  -4% efficiency and was averaging 6 TOs a game in a 4-1 series defeat. Was pretty overmatched though so I can’t blame him for this one a lot, but this is his first series on his own   Westbrook in 17-18   Regular = 25/10/10 on 52% TS   Playoffs = 29/10/12 on 49% TS  So he was already 3% below league average efficiency, and then it drops -3% again in the playoffs and he’s averaging 5 TOs a game. Gets outplayed by rookie Donovan Mitchell   Westbrook in 18-19 and 19-20 we already know    So now let’s look at Lillard   Lillard in 13-14   Regular season = 21/4/6 on 57% TS   Playoffs = 23/5/7 on 58% TS  So Lillard is already at +4% efficiency in the regular season, and it rises to +5% while increasing his averages and winning a series vs the Rockets   Lillard in 14-15   Regular season = 21/5/6 on 56% TS  Playoffs = 22/4/5 on 49% TS   So steep drop off this year, got shut down by the Grizzlies   Lillard in 15-16   Regular = 25/4/7 on 56% TS   Playoffs = 27/4/6 on 53% TS  So this is another drop and he wins a series vs the Clippers but CP3 and Blake get hurt so you can discount this one too. But you can see when Lillard’s efficiency drops, he’s right where regular season Westbrook pretty much already is   Lillard in 16-17   Regular season = 27/5/6 on 59% TS  Playoffs = 28/5/3 on 55% TS  Swept by invincible Warriors   Lillard in 17-18   Regular season = 27/5/7 on 59% TS  Playoffs = 19/5/5 on 47% TS   This is when the Pelicans wrecked him, so awful year   Lillard in 18-19   Regular season = 26/5/7 on 59% TS   Playoffs = 27/5/7 on 57% TS   Made the conference finals this year, beat OKC with MVPG, The Nuggets, and lost to invincible Warriors   Lillard this year in 19-20   Regular season = 30/4/8 on 63% TS  Playoffs = 24/4/4 on 62% TS  Completely overmatched but still took a game off the champion Warriors. Westbrook has never had a year as good as Dame had this past year  Dame is always more efficient in the regular season and his drop off is never as steep as Westbrook’s besides the pelicans year, Westbrook is already starting from barely league average efficiency. You can say scoring efficiency isn’t everything, but it’s a lot when Westbrook is taking 20+ shots a game. He puts up bigger passing numbers but he also puts up huge TO numbers he’s not efficient there either. Westbrook also was a good defender early on in his career but hasn’t been good in a loooong time, and rebounding doesn’t meaningfully impact winning for PGs (plus it was their scheme to let him get boards)  Westbrook is one of the most talented PGs ever but you can’t win with him in the playoffs. With the ball in his hands he’s way too reckless of a decision maker and hasn’t improved in that aspect at all. You can Lillard’s clear progress, he took the Pelicans series as a lesson on what he needed to improve and now he’s a compete monster, Westbrook has never been as lethal offensively as Lillard is now   Off the ball he’s never been a reliable shooter and isn’t super active. He’s a guy that can get your team to the playoffs through volume numbers and sheer will as dumb as it sounds lol but he can’t do anything once he’s there. Lillard has terrible failures too, but Westbrook has never had the success Lillard did by himself"
"Check the TS% on all those   I’ll give you one dame series:  33/4/6 on 62% TS   Russell Westbrook In the same series   23/9/11 on 47% TS   Westbrook was healthy, in his prime, and had the more talented team. And he got stomped 4-1  And Westbrook has never looked better than Steph Curry in any series lol"
"Westbrook averaged 27 6 6 in the finals and saying Westbrook has never showed up in the playoffs in the whole decade is delusional. 2016 vs mavs 26ppg 11.2 apg 7.2 rpg 2016 vs Spurs 25ppg 10.5 apg 6.5 rpg 2016 vs gsw   26.7 ppg 11.2 apg. 7 rpg 2017 vs hou   37.5 ppg. 10.8 apg  11.6rpg 2018 vs jazz    29.3ppg  7.5 apg.  10rpg   This is about half of Russell Westbrook good playoff series in these series he was guarded by Klay Thompson, pat bev, kawhi Leonard. He went toe to toe with steph and looked like the best guard in the series for the first four games. Dame every time he plays curry in the finals gets massacred. Don’t let these last two season fool you when Westbrook played injured in the playoffs.Pls name me five series of dames that are as good as these."
Sources have told me Lakers are finalizing a sign and trade of Anthony Davis for Russell Westbrook
"Stephen A always does this shit, takes something reported by Woj/Shams and then add 10x more fake drama to it and pretend that he's breaking news.   Woj: ""Kyrie requested a trade""   Stephen A the next day: ""LEBRON WANNA FIGHT KYRIE!!!""  Woj: ""Russ requested a trade""   Stephen A the next day: ""RUSSELL WESTBROOK AND JAMES HARDEN HATE EACH OTHER!!!!"""
"&gt; I often though that KD would prefer his team lose, if he didn’t get appropriate credit for something...  &gt; AND cede control of the team to Steph  Those are bold claims about an all time great scorer who took a backseat to Steph the same way Steph took a backseat to him. The man also played with Russell Westbrook and let him handle the ball. I don’t think anyone on that warriors team was selfish play-wise, and you’re making baseless accusations."
"I don't think there's any question in terms of ""profitability"" or increased media attention.  Knicks are one of the most profitable organizations year after year because of their die hard big market, regardless of how terrible the team is.  I'm asking a strictly basketball question - is picking up FVV, who will be a solid, above-average NBA point guard for them allowing RJ to potentially develop a better move, or is letting Russell Westbrook go full 2016-2017 mode and carry the team immediately to low playoff seeds a better play?"
I can't think of anything less fun than watching Russell Westbrook play without spacing
Working with the cards we are dearth is continuing the rebuild. We have a total of 2 good players right now. They’re both very young and can be around for a rebuild. Getting Russell Westbrook is the exact opposite of ideal for the cards we have.
"This is the triple double era...let's not get carried away, Russell Westbrook literally averaged a triple double for multiple seasons in a row in this era"
PG : Chauncey Billups - Russell Westbrook - Milos Teodosic  SG : Rip Hamilton - T-Mac - Iso Joe   SF : Danny Granger - Khris Middleton - Tayshaun Prince  PF : Sheed - KG - Jermaine O'Neal  C : Ben Wallace - Hakeem - Shaq
"It is almost impossible to get *two* All-Star caliber players on a cold-weather team outside of New York.  We've had six! In two years! Believe me, I am not weeping for the Sixers.  There is no process. There is no ""winning culture."" There is only a bitter mirage of hope for the many, and the guarantee of glory for the few. In all honesty, we should just end the charade, abolish the draft, and operate a soccer-like system of ascending amateur camp leagues. That way, at least all the guys will be local. Otherwise there's no point.  Like, what is wrong with the Timberwolves? This is a business! You have a chance to sell jerseys, you sell the jerseys. Draft LaMelo! Don't lie to yourself; he'll be gone in four years anyway, when you give him a $300M extension and he decides to join whatever's left of the Clippers.  The Hornets: What are you gonna do, sign Kawhi? Just trade for Russell Westbrook and sell the jerseys. Attract some extra eyeballs for a year.  There is no championship. There is no pursuit. There is no NBA. There is only the lie. This is why you will rarely hear me criticize the Celtics organization: It's a dog-eat-dog world. Trade your injuries. Reject this psaltry hope. Reject the lie. Embrace the horror, and perhaps ye shall master it.  Have a great day."
And Russell Westbrook? LOL
remember to bring that up next Russell Westbrook thread and see what this sub says then.
But what if Russell Westbrook is only 50% gone? What do they do if they only have half of him?
Russell Westbrook had 50% more triple doubles in one season than every Jazz player combined had in 46 years.
"&gt;MOREY: “And we felt like the team we had with Chris and James was extremely good but was going to come up short of the title. And we thought that adding Russ, who unquestionably has this peak level of play that not many guys have reached, was the right move.”  https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/daryl-morey-explains-why-rockets-traded-for-russell-westbrook/541629  Does it sound like he had a gun to his head?"

Russell Westbrook and Danny Green will be your Splash Bros.
"Russell Westbrook at age 35 with take up 40% of our cap space.   I do not understand why the appeal is always for a big star. Russ can't even shoot 3s well and won't help the development of RJ or Mitch   Give me FVV, a guy who's proven he can shoot, pass, AND show up when you needed him most in crucial playoffs times.  Rather build something sustainable than something that's based on a aging star with a shit contract."
Russell Westbrook averages 24.8 ppg in the playoffs. Thats less than one field goal less than Steph. Just because they are point guards that can score doesn’t mean they are great floor generals/facilitators
"If they add nothing else, they would be better with Westbrook. But FVV for the money is a better deal. RJ and Russell on the floor together might get pretty ugly."
"LaVine stat check; 25-4-4 45%fg 38%3ptfg 1.5 steals  We’ll say average or a little below average defence for his position and his offensive workload.  Never been on a winning team, how much you attribute that to his brand of basketball can be debated.   So BLAM here’s some player groupings not factoring age or potential.  Group clearly above him; Lebron: Davis: Giannis: Doncic: Tatum: Durant: Butler: Bam: Sabonis: Beal: Jokic: Dame: CJ: Mitchell: Embiid: Thompson: Curry: Leonard: Booker: Harden: Simmons: Cp3: KAT (23)  Group that I think is clearly above him but I could see some arguments against it Porzingus: Brown: Trae Young: Siakim: Kyrie Irving: Lowry: Jamal Murray: Nurkic: Paul George: Ayton: Ja Morant: B.I: Zion: Jrue Holliday: (15)  Spicy group that we could debate but still putting ahead of lavine Gobert: blocked all the shots for months  Middleton: swap their roles I foretell similar stats with better defence  Fox: I just like him Jaren Jackson Jr: my roommate just likes him Demar Derozan: fuck the narratives dude can ball Westbrook: still 25-9-9 on his own team Ingram: taller lavine Vucevic: carries equally shitty teams to the playoffs annually  Kemba Walker: I think he’s worse buddy thinks he’s better that’s my cut off line (9) (47)  So according to my incredibly biased list he’s the 48th best player right now (not factoring in age)   Have him ranked as clearly Better than guys: FVV Blake Griffin (but see how he comes back) Oladipo Aaron Gordon Deangelo Russell Draymond Green Aldridge  Don’t know what to do with Tyler Herro or MPJ"
"Russell Westbrook and the Knicks just sound so perfect together, and honestly, having Russ playing in the biggest city in the country no matter how bad the Knicks are still will be pretty fun to watch and will bring at least some excitement to that team."
"No, they haven't. That is completely false. Russell Westbrook has the 2nd highest career usage in NBA history behind only Michael Jordan, and he is not far behind at all. Quit trying to normalize his ball-hoggy-ness."
"I had to look up, and his usage percentage is in the top 5 in the league, between James Harden and Russell Westbrook, which is pretty impressive considering this is his sophomore year. His turnover percentage has had a little decrease from last year but it's still like top 20. Sincerely I thought his percentages were going to be worse because he is getting double teamed a lot. So, he still has a high tov% but it's undoubtable that he's becoming more polished as a playmaker."
"&gt; Okay... that wouldn’t be the case and an absolute terrible way to look at the situation.  Yes, it would. The Knicks were .134 behind the 8th seed this season, and adding Westbrook isn't going to get anywhere near closing that gap.   If you think the Knicks roster + Russell Westbrook is going to complete with the Bucks, Raptors, Celtics, Pacers, Heat, 76ers or Nets, I don't even know what to tell you.  So that leaves the 8th seed alone as a possibility. The Magic is probably not going to be able to keep that spot, but there's a good chance the Wizards will improve if Wall comes back, the Bulls are rumored to be aggressively shopping, and the Hawks have a lot of development potential.  The *best case scenario* for the Knicks if they sign Westbrook is an 8th seed.   &gt;Also what the hell has your franchise been doing for the last 8 seasons other then going out of their way to suck ass and never even compete for the 8 seed clown.  We've been doing exactly the same as what the reason for signing Westbrook would be. Trying to satisfy an owner who wants the team to make the playoffs despite never building a coherent roster.   &gt;Knicks fuckin suck and Westbrook makes y’all suck less and gives some type of real success in the locker room for the young guys.  *Sucking less* isn't a good thing in the NBA. Especially not in a season where the draft is absolutely stacked, and the salary cap is on the way down.   Also, Westbrook is a worst case scenario for the young guys. His usage rate is absolutely ridiculous, if you're going to be mediocre or worse, you want the ball in the hands of the young guys.  &gt;I asked for you reasoning and you gave a 1st grade answer. Pretty apparent you can’t talk ball if that’s all you come back with.  His answer was a hell of a lot better than yours, not that either one of you were particularly articulate about it.  You're a Rockets fan though, I don't blame you for desperately wanting to get away from that contract."
"OP’s point was that he was having a career best season and he wasn’t. The OP of the post was asking if Russ is a top ten player and he isn’t. Your original comment was that he had a good three month stretch of basketball and that it wasn’t a small sample size, which, in comparison to the last three seasons, isn’t true, and, in relation to the larger point of the thread and the post, is completely irrelevant. I concede that Russell Westbrook was good for three months this year. Does that make you feel better?"
"Three whole months?  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01/gamelog/2020/  I’m sorry, I should have looked it up first. Did you?  It was a almost exactly two month stretch from January 9th to March 10th, unless you want to include his 9/22 shit show against Phoenix on the 3rd, which I kinda figured you didn’t.   Literally everything is a sample size, no matter how large. Do you know what sample size means? Even if it WAS three months, which we’ve established that it wasn’t, it’s still a small *sample size* compared to the larger *sample size* of the rest of the season and the previous two seasons which show a serious decline from his peak.   But no, we’re supposed to instead look at 27 games played during the doldrums of the regular season and say hey, this is the real Russell Westbrook! Not the guy we’ve seen for the other 200 games during the last two plus years. Not the guys we’ve seen during the playoffs. Nope, let’s turn a blind eye to all that and focus only on him during a hot streak during a dull stretch of the regular season."
Russell Westbrook? Win now?
"there’s a lot of positives to it, especially if Westbrook really doesn’t care about a ring. he will win them some games, sell out some games, mentor RJ on his game inside, playmaking, and rebounding which he has shown to have some decent potential for as a guard, and they both have faced meme level scrutiny to this very day, so they literally can’t fail unless Russell completely drops off for some reason."
"Everyone is going to criticize this shit cause it's the Knicks and fits into whatever kind of wya they're shitting on them (seriously it's like the 10th Knicks posts I've seen on this sub I. The past day)  Honestly I do think we should win some games   I do NOT think we should get Russell Westbrook.  I do think we can get a guy like FVV or Christian Wood.  Winning games &amp; development while not blocking our cap space &amp; keeping flexible for '21 but getting good guys like FVV, Wood, Gallo etc is what I'd do"
I remember Russell Westbrook taking his teams to the playoffs in the west after KD left 🤔
"Westbrook is just the best player between those 2 teams, especially since Orlando's best player cannot create for himself that much since he is a center. Isaac will be 100% out for next season. There is for me almost no way they wouldn't be worse than the Knicks with Russell. But what I really want is Westbrook on the Magic with the spacing of Vooch, Aminu (at the 4 until Isaac is back), Ross, Fournier and Westbrook. A. Gordon, Bamba, Fultz to the Rockets and Orlando gets the Rockets pick this year plus their 2nd next year."
"This trade is obviously unrealistic, but what if this got modified into this:  **Nets Receive**  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden  **Rockets Receive**  * Kyrie Irving * Spencer Dinwiddie * Caris Levert * Taurean Prince * Some 1st round picks."
"Most season? Defo LeBron. I think CP3 and Russell Westbrook also have a say, but Russ was only one year, albeit a terrible year."
Lmao Randle and DSJ's trash ass for All-NBA 3rd team Russell Westbrook?  You Knicks fans are on one
The point isn't to move the needle it's to create a good environment to develop their players. FVV and wood are solid guys that still have more upside and can help make the team more competitive but not gimp them long term like westbrook will.   And those aren't the only ones. There are other young players thry can try to acquire. Deangelo Russell was an example of a young player that was available multiple times in his career.   The knicks have done what you're proposing before. Amare stoduemire and Carmelo were better versions of what westbrook is and it still played out poorly for the most part since they quickly fell off and were bad.
"I love Russell Westbrook and I live in NYC. This feels so ""Knicks,"" though."
Cant really compare the two but lemme show my guy Dame some love and do the bye bye Russell Westbrook wave to all those who said Jokic
"You may be right - interestingly though, Kristaps Porzingis and Carmelo Anthony actually, and I just double-checked this, are different people than RJ Barrett and Russell Westbrook"
"Maybe the Knicks trade for both Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love in order to recreate their UCLA days.    Honestly I’m a Nets fan but I think the Knicks need to make a move like this or something similar. Unless they overpay Free Agents are they really going to lure anyone to New York.   NYK haven’t made the Playoffs since the 2012-13 season and haven’t had an All Star playing for them since trading Porzingis. Lottery isn’t guaranteed to work out in their favor.   If the Knicks get lucky they’d go after Westbrook and try to get someone like Gordon Hayward. Highly doubt the Celtics would take a combo of Bobby Portis, DSJ or Elfrid Payton, Wayne Ellington, and Taj Gibson.   Idk what it would take to get Westbrook. If Rockets take like Randle, Payton and Mavs 1st that would be decent but Knox may come into play.    Could the Knicks get Gordon Hayward for Bobby Portis, and someone left out of DSJ, Ellington, and Gibson plus maybe a Protected 1st. Like a 1st that’s Top 15, Top 10, Top 5, or 2-2nd’s if it doesn’t convey over 3-4yrs.   Maybe they work it out so they land Obi Toppin at PF. They’d still potentially have the full Mid Level Exception which is like $9-10m. Idk if keeping Ellington and Gibson for $ matching purposes would change the MLE to the Tax which would be like $5-6m instead of $9-10m. Those numbers could be slightly off though.    MLE can be split so that offers up more possibilities. They’d be smart to keep the $18m between Gibson and Ellington on the books for another potential trade since that’s solid expiring $. Dotson and Harkless are also FA’s they could be re signed.   * Westbrook - Frank N - ??   * Barrett - Dotson? - Ellington?   * Hayward - Bullock? - ??   * Toppin? - Harkless? - ??   * Robinson - Gibson? - ??   Spend that MLE wisely and that team would most likely beat the Magic who are down Issac and are looking to possibly trade Gordon. Then it comes down to the Pacers since they’re going to naturally drop if the Nets are a healthy team this season.    It’s highly unlikely that the Knicks will land Hayward but I think if they could get a roster similar to that with Westbrook with a few more shooters they could get a 7-8 seed and maybe a 6 seed if things go right.   Would need a good backup Center for Robinson since he’s been foul prone."
Literally starting anywhere else than Russell Westbrook is ideal.
I am ready for the Russell Westbrook and New York Knicks redemption arc this next season lol
KD will never come close to meaning as much as Westbrook does. Russell is Oklahoma.
Russell Westbrook is like the point guard equivalent to a power forward.
"This is the most inaccurate statement I've ever read. Ever. Jordan was known as a great player who couldn't win a championship until Pippen came in and elevated the bulls to elite status. Jordan had the same narrative as pre 2011 Dirk until Pippen elevated the bulls. One great player isn't enough, hell Harden can't even win with 2 great players on the squad. Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Russell Westbrook."
"It’s not even just the contract it’s also him as a player. He can’t lead a team to anything of substance. He’ll get a triple double season, maybe an MVP, sick dunks and but a 1st round exit. Russell Westbrook ain’t winning shit."
RUSSELL WESTBROOK HAS TO LEAVE THE BUBBLE
Russell Westbrook   11/12/88 - 9/4/20
"Russell Westbrook  June 3, 1975 - September, 4 2020"
Here lies Russell Westbrook III
RUSSELL WESTBROOK GOT BAPTIZED
RUSSELL WESTBROOK WELCOME TO YOUR KODAK MOMENT
REST IN PEACE  RUSSELL WESTBROOK 🙏
Here lies Russell Westbrook
"is russell westbrook was as good as he thinks he is, he'd be the GOAT.  how about you just get us an easy layup on a 2 on 1?"
Russell Westbrook lost in the first.
"&gt; Russell Westbrook   Brodie used to dunk it every time, just like LeBron in the 2000s. I think older players stop with the dunks in order to reduce strain and injury risk. A lay up also conserves energy opposed to engaging in a contact dunk which is often the only alternative to get a dunk instead of a lay up. While I'd like to see Brodie dunk more, too, I think he payed his dues in this department."

"Russell Westbrook is going to feast. Look for him and  Harden to attack the paint consistently to get the laker's bigs in foul trouble. The refs have been cruel to dwight in the bubble with their whistle as it is. Houston's strategy will include constant pressure in the paint, and they have the perfect players for it. Russ gets to the paint easily due to athleticism.  Harden gets there easily due to skill. I believe they will force the issue on this one. Not saying it will work, but I think it will be the strategy."

"Russell westbrook is gonna be a hof pg too, do i want him as a coach though?"
If the Russell Westbrook you were getting was the one from Jan-March then I think on paper this might actually be close and closer to 50-50  But that’s not reality right now not where he is physically which is why I just don’t see more than Houston doing their usual take a few games get people to buy in a little and then come up short
