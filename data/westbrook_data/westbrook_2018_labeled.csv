Russell Westbrook Defensive eye control MY MVP,0
wouldnt all these dudes dominate as goalies Id think someone like Russell Westbrook could be the best goaltender ever,1
When Especially having pulled their starters with 8 mins left and down 17 with 2 mins left   They were there to statpad thats why Russell got mad for Adams not shooting when he made a even better pass instead   It ignores how Adams boxes out for Westbrook to pad his rebounds ,-1
httpsftwusatodaycom201610kevindurantrussellwestbrookgoldenstatewarriorsthunderworkfriends  You talk big but you failed to type it into Google yourself KD said that because that is what you are supposed to say about your teammate He doesnt really feel that way,-1

The constant disrespect towards Ben Simmons is so confusing Dude was a top 10 defender at 3 different positions on the court with 1588 as a rookie lol Giannis is the Russell Westbrook of the East Stat stuffing doesnt always lead to wins ,1
Almost everyone in the NBA does lol KD Kawhi Paul George Paul Pierce Chris Paul Klay Thompson Russell Westbrook all of them are or were attached to the Lakers at some point,1

Russell Westbrook needs to tweak his jump shot ever so slightly and hell be a knockdown three point shooter Also derrick rose is going to have the best shooting season of his career from three  Im calling it,0

Its just not a good decision for the franchise to trade Westbrook now Maybe for longterm value in winning games it could have a chance of being better but Russell Westbrook IS the Thunder right now Hes an Oklahoma icon and it would be bad business for the Thunder to part ways with him,-1

When Especially having pulled their starters with 8 mins left and down 17 with 2 mins left   They were there to statpad thats why Russell got mad for Adams not shooting when he made a even better pass instead   It ignores how Adams boxes out for Westbrook to pad his rebounds ,-1
httpsftwusatodaycom201610kevindurantrussellwestbrookgoldenstatewarriorsthunderworkfriends  You talk big but you failed to type it into Google yourself KD said that because that is what you are supposed to say about your teammate He doesnt really feel that way,-1
Dude LeBron cost himself the MVP He tanked for a month to get IT and Crowder off the team Soon as they were gone he went from DeMar DeRozan stats to Russell Westbrook stats lol,1
Russell Westbrook is Matthew McConaugheys bookcase in interstellar,0
gt nobody will ever win anything with russell westbrook on their team  Except before KD left he was a huge part of multiple 55 win championship contenders The Thunder coulda won a championship by now if injuries hadnt taken two playoff runs from them ,1
I dont think hes over rated but let me just say that nobody will ever win anything with russell westbrook on their team or donovan being your coach,1
John Wall and Cousins if he were healthy  Russell Westbrook and James Harden for good times sake  Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell because I feel like their games compliment each other  Steve Nash and AD  ,1
Im fucking with you if you couldnt tell btw I knew you were probably talking about this season but technically you werent We call this a bait Also he can be talking about dunking on someone when its friendly banter Also you saw what happened to Russell Westbrook right,1

OKC  4 Russell Westbrook  24 Serge Ibaka   ,0
The difference is OKC has Russell Westbrook an MVP caliber player the Hornets do not,0
according to this sub  James Harden Draymond Green Dwight Howard Russell Westbrook and KD,0
Russell Westbrook being able to play defense and not doing it is worse than KAT being soft ,0
Goku  LeBron James Vegeta  Russell Westbrook Android 17  Jimmy Butler Piccolo  Kevin Love Krillin  Tyrone Lue Majin Boo  Kevin Durant,1
westbrook is especially bad with all that wasted athleticism if a regular guy like chris paul can play solid defense then russell should honestly be the next gary payton,1
Id go with guys with distinct looks and playstyles like the first one My picks would be  Russell Westbrook James Harden Anthony Davis Kevin Durant not sure a bout the lastBlake Griffin maybe ,0
Not only did he not make an all defense team he got 0 votes for the all defensive teamshttpswwwredditcomrnbacomments8lll87votingforthenbaalldefensiveteams putting him behind noted defensive stoppers like Russell Westbrook and Dame Lillard,1
The constant disrespect towards Ben Simmons is so confusing Dude was a top 10 defender at 3 different positions on the court with 1588 as a rookie lol Giannis is the Russell Westbrook of the East Stat stuffing doesnt always lead to wins ,1
Almost everyone in the NBA does lol KD Kawhi Paul George Paul Pierce Chris Paul Klay Thompson Russell Westbrook all of them are or were attached to the Lakers at some point,1
and thats all scoring is dude or else Otto Porter would be a better scorer than Russell Westbrook because hes more efficient and takes a backseat,1
1 LeBron  2 Stephen Curry  3 Kevin Durant  4 Dwight Howard I almost put him 3rd fwiw  5 James Harden  6 Chris Paul  7 Dirk Nowitzki  8 Dwayne Wade  9 Russell Westbrook  10 Anthony Davis  Melo gets honorable mention at 11th,1
Can you imagine having Russell Westbrook as your fatherinlaw,0
Russell Westbrook only makes love for the purpose of having children and he gets his wife pregnant the first try every single time so shut your disrespectful mouth,1
My wife hates basketball All the players she would know come from me or something in the nonsports media  Current LeBron Curry KD Russell Westbrook my favorite player Harden  Past MJ Pippen Shaq Kobe Rodman,0
So then I guess Russell Westbrook outplayed LeBron too in 2017,0
Russell Westbrook needs to tweak his jump shot ever so slightly and hell be a knockdown three point shooter Also derrick rose is going to have the best shooting season of his career from three  Im calling it,0
For real I could easily see Giannis staying with the Bucks for his whole career Not to mention guys like Russell Westbrook Anthony Davis Steph Curry and Damian Lillard all have been loyal and received the loyalty quantity of money in return for it ,1

Russell Westbrook is the closest thing we have to an active volcano in the NBA  Lol,1

Russell Westbrook is the player who is most likely to get a triple double,0
Harden actually had the greatest offensive season ever in 1617   Downvoted for facts httpswwwfoxsportscomnbagalleryrussellwestbrooknbabestindividualseasongreatestalltimemichaeljordanstephencurry040817,1
You might think that but he was 27 in the 201516 season which makes it fairly normal  For comparison Russell Westbrook was 28 in his MVP season Steve Nash was 3132 for his MVPs James Harden was 28 last year,0
IIRC you guys gave russell westbrook and john wall A perimeter defense grades  most NBA observers dont think much of either guys defense at this point  without giving away your methodology what aspects of defense does your approach value higher than other evaluatorsmetrics,1

I love watching Russell Westbrook might be my favorite player in the league but Im glad he didnt end up signing with my team Athleticism is his best skill and that is a finite resource with an expiration date on it,1
I mean whenever people walk about height though they want that information in relation to other players Shoes change and Id rather know James Harden is exactly 2 inches taller than Russell Westbrook than know that KD is about 3 feet from the basket when in shoes,0

Technically neither Kevin Durant nor Russell Westbrook were drafted by the Oklahoma City Thunder,0

Said this earlier but its like saying the Mavs should have traded Dirk in 2008  2 seasons removed from MVP  2 first round exits  You never trade the face of the franchise unless they ask you to    Cant believe you are mentioning this on Russell Westbrook day in OKC  ,1
Its just not a good decision for the franchise to trade Westbrook now Maybe for longterm value in winning games it could have a chance of being better but Russell Westbrook IS the Thunder right now Hes an Oklahoma icon and it would be bad business for the Thunder to part ways with him,-1
yup if the were fr about winning the would have kept Harden and paid the tax But imo a Russell Westbrook lead team will forever be in NBA mid level purgatory 79 seed can really get better with blowing it up,1
