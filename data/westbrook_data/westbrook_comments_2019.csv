"Winning MVP is a great achivement, but what's good if you cannot get the job done in playoffs?  Russell WestBrook won MVP a couple of years ago and his team got swept in the 1st round.  Same goes for Kobe Bryant during 2007-08 season despite haivng an MVP season.   "
The next Russell Westbrook?
"Exactly.  Not an OKC hater or anything but, there just something on OKC specially westbrook that he chokes on clinched or tight moments. I remember when Indiana went really high with a beast paul George and went up against Lebron's Cavs. That was the East. OKC cant even handle Jazz. And i bet they would even lose to Nuggets if they got paired with them. OKC is such a trap card in Playoffs. Not sure if its Russell or just the team in general.  For Portland...meh maybe. if  look u  at round 2 its, Nuggets, Spurs/Portland, Rockets, then GSW.   "
"What you mean? Russ has like 4 blunders in the video including one where he just throws the ball right into curry hands from the inbounds. The video has on KD breakdown on defense, where is the second?   I’d argue that really bad errors signify someone with terrible iq who can’t be trusted in times where every possession matters but even if we’re gonna say all mistakes are the same then it still doesn’t help your case because russ made a lot more of them throughout the game. The only reason it was even a close game near the end was specifically because of russ    I have responded to your argument, I have said that KD made mistakes. What I’m saying is that doesn’t mean he wasn’t the best player on the thunder by far and that doesn’t he’s the reason they lost. It just means that he wasn’t  able to close out a game that never should have been that close to begin with. The reason it was that close to begin with was in large part due to the play of Russell Westbrook.   If you wanna blame KD for not getting the win then fine( he’s the primary reason OKC was up 3-1 but whatever), but that doesn’t mean he’s the reason you lost. There’s a lot of blame to go around but the guy who should be shouldering most of it is russ.   Alright then"

Only Russell Westbrook is capable on avg 14 apg for the remaining  31 to steal the lead in apg
"The video you showed does more to show how Russell blew the game than anyone else... Durant forced a few things and had some costly turnovers but the fact is that the thunder would be in a much more comfortable position had Westbrook simply gave a damn on defense the entire match.   They most certainly did run iso in the clutch, which signifies a team that has no system or philosophy on offense so they revert back to old habits, the offense was out of sorts and stagnant and none of the role players got any touches or were used in ways that would create space, Great defensive teams can easily take advantage of this and the warriors did( they did the same thing to CLE in game 3 2017 and game 4 2016). However they still could have won in spite of this if it wasn’t for Westbrook’s horrible defense throughout the game .   The rockets in 2018 switched everything and this blew up a lot of the warriors wanted to do on offense, they gave it to KD because he was the one with a definite advantage against a switching defense and he had trouble balancing when to attack vs when to look for the open man. Considering the warriors are a team that has an offense predicated on ball and player movement, playing  in ISO is pretty unnatural for them and it takes them out of their offense. Credit the rockets for the great game plan but it was still uncharacteristic of the warriors to play so poorly.  KD signalled waiters to move because it was destroying the spacing around him... so that part actually makes sense.  Also Iguodala was clearly forcing Durant to his right( aka baseline, the warriors always take away middle and force baseline) KD tries to get to his spot but is quickly surprised by a double team( great defense by curry) and makes a horrible pass with the right idea in mind( hit ibaka cutting to the rim). So bad turnover  Second turnover was more of a credit to draymond Green fantastic defensive awareness to get a steal that not very many players can get. Still a costly turnover.    KD was the thunders best defender in that series no doubt, that doesn’t mean he’s infallible on the defensive end and he’s the last guy on the thunder that should be getting crap for bad defense.  Poor shot selection is something the thunder have done all season long and it’s something they still do till this day, when you play on a team that doesn’t have any offensive philosophy or system then yea your gonna struggle that doesn’t mean KD is blameless but he clearly an extension of a much larger issue.   Here’s the thing: KD mistakes are something that any player could make, Russell’s mistakes are the kind that gets a coach pulling their hair out with how bad they are, they are senseless, random and downright silly. KD made some blunders but none of them can even compare to the kind of things that russ does not only in this game but in multiple play off series. Russell Westbrook was directly involved in 14 defensive breakdowns through the course of this game... 14! Do you have any idea how ridiculous that is? If he cuts that in half then the thunder win decisively and most of those breakdowns are a result of extremely poor effort and horrible IQ.   If you want we can go through them one by one and I will show you how much worse they are than anything KD did. "

"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dbM48NeCyqc  KD didn’t shoot the ball well, which is to be expected when going vs an all time great defense with an offense predicated on isolation. Durant however did play superhuman defense the entire and was a huge reason OKC was able to take games 3 &amp; 4. Not to mention that he just had a better overall series than Westbrook did.   KD May have not have played up to his standards in game 6, but Russell Westbrook did things that directly contributed to the loss and if a guy like CP3 was in his place, the thunder probably win a ring"
"You're not shitting on him?  You keep talking about how players have to find a balance, and how he's going for boards and that's why he gets them.  You started this by claiming his numbers are ""inflated"".  You want to tell me when the word ""inflated"" is ever used in a non derogetory way?  Andre earns those boards, and crashes hard and boxes out often, because that's what he's supposed to do.  Those numbers aren't inflated, they're a totally accurate representation of what he does.  Inflated numbers is Russell Westbrook collecting 15 boards 11 of which are uncontested because Steven Adams did so much of the work.  Not Andre getting 16 because that's what he has to do."

Russell Westbrook is your MVP?
"I realise that bringing up advanced stats to Thunder fans would be pointless, you guys had the king of advanced stats and he left you because he didn't want to be stuck next to Russell Westbrook, who's an all time terrible 3 point shooter but can't stop himself from taking them at a clip of 4.6 (!!) per game.   Is averaging 21 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds on god awful efficiency supposed to be something that impresses me terribly much? Your whole offense is based around Westbrook bringing the ball up from the backcourt every possession. The man only has 1.5 offensive rebounds per game. Russ is a better passer than he gets credit for, but come on man. He is averaging 10 points less per game than he did two seasons ago, on significantly worse efficiency. Russ getting a triple double might have been the key to OKC wins when he was actually playing well two seasons ago, but you're beyond delusional if you think what he's currently doing is playing winning basketball. Paul George is far and away the best ball player currently in Oklahoma. "
"There's at least Steph, Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Isaiah Thomas, Russell Westbrook according to this article: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2690521-looking-back-at-the-high-school-scouting-reports-of-todays-biggest-nba-stars#slide13"
"Any great player is both a floor raiser and a ceiling raiser. Some dudes' skillsets are just better fitted to one role.  The more efficient you are, the less you need the ball to score, the more value you bring on both sides of the court outside of scoring, the better ceiling raiser you are.  The more you can shoulder an offensive load with raw production, efficiency be damned, both in terms of scoring and playmaking, the better a floor raiser you are.  Agree to disagree I guess, but Iverson is up there with guys like Westbrook and Wilt as guys who are much more floor raiser than ceiling raisers.  LeBron's with guys like Wade, Kareem and Harden, can do both but better fitted as a floor raiser.  Kobe and Jordan are in the same category as KD or Duncan. Almost the perfect halfway point but slightly better suited to raising ceilings.  Curry's in a class of his own as a ceiling raiser IMO. Unprecedented. Maybe Magic, Bird and Russell come close, but that's it. "

"Correlation does not imply causation. The Thunder win when Russell Westbrook plays well, and they lose when he doesn't.

"Players have more control and are incentivized to team up, players would have done this years ago of they could have.   I disagree that it's impossible for Portland or Milwalkee to contend this year. NBA playoffs more often than not award the most talented teams, however several times it has revealed the importance of chemistry. Klay Thompson is not as valuable a centerpiece as Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook but on the floor next to Steph Curry and the other GSW pieces they were the better team. (I can hear the argument that OKC that year was better despite losing but my point still is talent can have a diminished utility and how players compliment each other is important )"
"If he continues like this, assuming same numbers pretty much, we're talking about a player who never even averages above 20 points a season, it's not close to consistency and level of MVP and 7 times ALL NBA Russell Westbrook.

"Is anyone reading this currently 19? If you were zapped right now away from where you are right now - reading this on your laptop in your room, or perhaps on your phone while taking a shit - and suddenly you are on court as the starting guard for the 76ers and you've got *Russell fucking Westbrook* suddenly not just come to life from years of watching him and idolising him from a distance but actually glaring at you from a few feet away looking like he's absolutely ready to kill you and there are 20,000 fans right there making a hell of a lot of noise and you can see so many of them are wearing your jersey and there's music blaring and a million more people watching on TV and a rabid media pack *ready* to tear you apart and this is your lifelong dream and you are the No.1 pick and had goddamn better perform as such and here it all is right now... - no matter how talented you actually are, you have to have an insane level of self-confidence and self-assuredness to be able to handle that. Most professional athletes do have that, it's exactly how they got to that position in the first place, but not all do and it's sort of surprising that this sort of thing doesn't happen more often.    I don't actually know Fultz's backstory or upbringing, but his mother and how much trust he has in her or how much he feels he owes her - especially if he's also always lacked some self-confidence, and if she has legitimately 'protected' him from trouble or legit bad people before - it might be a hell of a lot more than is evident in even the best relationships any of us have with our own mothers or fathers or parents as a whole. The whole thing could be really difficult - his trust in her is absolute, anything that might let her down at all is non-negotiable, he might have always struggled with confidence. The team has to be super careful with doing anything that is upsetting or offensive to him... it can be a really difficult situation. It's not that easy for the team to tell him ""You need to remove *your mother* from your life"". Or even just ""you need to stop trusting her, what she's doing is wrong for you.""    When it comes to KP and his brother, and situations like that, that's a bit different. I get that for these guys - no matter who they are and what age or background or where they sit on the NBA ladder - trust in people is really difficult and with family it's really simple, but there's a point with KP/brother or Kawhi/Uncle where really, if the stories are true, you're old enough and experienced enough to know you're making a mistake with this person, and they're old enough and experienced enough to handle any 'rejection' from you. A low confidence 19 year old kid just arriving in the league is a different story. He wouldn't know better and he couldn't possibly see it himself, and perhaps guiding him towards that is just really incredibly difficult. Minefield.  "
"This is such a dumb take. Harden shot 40% from the field that year and wasn't even a playmaker for that team. Russell Westbrook also was barely an average point guard at that time.

Tim Duncan is arguably a top 10 nba player ever and just spent his whole career in small market San Antonio. Then they added all-nba LaMarcus Aldridge in FA. OKC is like the smallest market in the league and has kept Russell Westbrook and just added Paul George (OKC is a smaller market than Indianapolis!!!!). There’s no issue keeping these players if your organization is run well. Players are obviously willing to play in those markets. Golden State just happens to play in a bigger market but that homegrown roster could’ve been constructed anywhere.  Damian Lillard was in the same draft as Anthony Davis and he seems to be in Portland for the long haul. There’s just always going to be guys who want to play for the Lakers. It’s a fact of life. There’s a reason so many American celebrities live in LA and it’s also the franchise most synonymous with winning in the modern NBA (post-merger).  Chicago has a rich winning history and a huge market but nobody including Davis wants to play there cuz it’s a dumpster fire of an organization. Just run your team better and maybe hire a fucking basketball mind to be the GM. The Pelicans’ GM has another job as the GM of the Saints! It’s insane.  And again. Davis isn’t saying he won’t play out is contract. He’s just saying I’m not going to re-sign a new one so might as well trade me so we both win.
From a personal standpoint I wish this logic was true because then Russell Westbrook would have been the best player in the NBA for a year but obviously he wasn’t. Yes Dirk won MVP but the general consensus was that one of Kobe or LeBron was the best player in the league. top 5? Sure why not but getting eliminated as the first seed in the playoffs that year wasn’t exactly a good look on him 
"Except it wasn’t OKC that changed PG’s mind and I think a lot of people downplaying the role Westbrook took to keep him there.  Russell Westbrook is a special player, a lot like Harden although I guess you could say that Harden is in a large market now.  But for Westbrook, he’s built a brand and a huge following for someone who is in a small market.  Westbrook has a Hollywood type of appeal to him, style, swag, clout and for the times we’re living in, I really think that weighed heavily on PG. "
and that buddy? Russell Westbrook
"It starts at the top and trickles down. Reinsdorf and Dolan are incompetent and too cheap and hands on with their teams. You have guys like Paul George and Russell Westbrook signing long term contracts in Oklahoma fucking City of all places and then a bunch of players not wanting to play for two of the most storied franchises.   There is honestly no argument for small market teams being at a disadvantage. Sure, a lot of stars want to sign with big market teams when they become free agents, but if ownership and a FO makes their team appealing, they'll be able to court a great team. Golden State for christ's sake was considered one of the worst franchises of all time and a small market earlier this decade and look what they've done. "
"No. AD doesn't put up empty stats but he's the prototypical example of how playmakers and guards rule the league.

On top of that, I've personally always thought of AD as a best player but not best leader type, similar to what PG is like now. He's the best player on the Thunder but Russ is the leader.

He is already close to becoming the best player on the Thunder; I would go so far as to say he is the best. Russell Westbrook is a great play but George is just so much more valuable in the clutch. Just my opinion I have only had a chance to watch the Thunder when their games are nationally televised so maybe its a different story if you watch them ever night. It just feels like George shows up in the big games when it counts.
"First: Paul George, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, James Harden, Steph Curry  Second: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook  Third: LeBron James, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal"
This is crazy because it is very obvious that Russell Westbrook makes everyone around him a worse basketball player 
LMAO   who else in this sub believes kemba walker is better than russell westbrook  please speak now.
I don’t think anybody in the NBA could shoot 23/19/63 unless they were shooting jumpers opposite handed.   I still love the fearless style of play and the energy he plays with. He doesn’t do that taking nights off or conserving energy shit. He does what not many other stars do and he plays with the intensity of a young kid trying to keep a roster spot. For that I can’t really knock Russell too hard.   But because I’m a Thunder fan (yes an Oklahoma City fan. Not just a fan of Westbrook) I can see he has fast become the worst shooter on the whole roster (Dre Roberson might be worse. Maybe) and I just don’t get why he’s still shooting more than 10 shots a game.  At the start of the year Billy said Russ had been putting in work on his catch and shoot J so he could get his %’s up and let the offense flow without him touching everything. I’m watching in disbelief as he passes up almost every catch and shoot open look so he can dribble slowly and size up a defender (that was nowhere near him when he made the catch in shooting position) only to rip the cord and shoot a brick anyway.   There’s many a theory on why he’s lost his shot. But I dunno man. No theory really explains this type of stuff.   Go ahead and downvote me Westbrook fans. I’m probably as big a. Russ fan as any of you. I just love my team. Not one guy. 
&gt;shooting  &gt;winning  2017 Russell Westbrook says hi. 
Russell “been busting that ass for years” Westbrook lower than Lillard? Nah fam
How is Russell Westbrook 5th? The man has averaged a triple double for 3 years a row basically and he's 5th? John Wall gets hurt and doesn't play and he's suddenly not a top 10 PG? 
He's also far more switchable than Jayson Tatum. He gets beat because he is given more burden of responsibility on defense.   What do you think would happen if Tatum had to spend significant time on guards like Oladipo/Kemba Walker/Russell Westbrook Steph Curry or Eric Bledsoe [like Simmons has been asked to do at points his first two years in the league](https://on.nba.com/2CRQYP6). He'd get beat....and get beat a lot would Tatum. He would do worse at it htan Simmons would. Same thing if you asked Tatum to guard guys like [Jokic like Simmons has](https://on.nba.com/2CTqMDS).   Simmons has honestly declined a bit on defense this year compared to what he was as a rookie but Id still take him as an off ball defender over Tatum and his switchability gives him more value as well. 
I was referring to efficiency and this year's Russell Westbrook. There's a massive gap between the two.
Russell Westbrook is Triple H confirmed.
"&gt; People act like he's 2019 Russell Westbrook or something.  His usage rate is 39, the second highest in the history of the NBA behind 2017 Russ. So yeah, that is an apt comparison. "
Yeah there’s more stats. But those are things to take into consideration when comparing number. Otherwise Russell Westbrook would be considered the best player in the league.
"""I don't believe in small markets"" - Russell Westbrook"
"I think Giannis is still the front-runner.  That said, if you asked me, its because:  - historic numbers similar to 47-35 Russell Westbrook  - You can't give it to a Warrior.  I mean people will still argue you can, and they'll get some votes.  But I have no idea how you can give any kind of MVP or even best in the league award to a GSW, when they run out there with 5 all-star starters, including the best defender in the game, the best scorer in the game without requiring touches, one of the best and most diverse centers and none of those 3 are their two best players that already have 3 MVPs between them.  - I guess Milwaukee is boring for people?  Giannis' #s aren't so amazing?? I don't know.  I think he's the frontrunner.  - I'd give Jokic more weight... but somewhat similar to Giannis.  It's a Nugget, they're good, but are they really as good as their record?  And his numbers are great, but not amazing amazing amazing all time, never before done great - except the part where his assist numbers are insane while also still scoring and rebounding and winning.  - Kawhi won't play enough games and the Raptors seem to win at similar rates without him.  - Lebron won't play enough games... unless he comes back and goes 35/10/10 the rest of the way and the Lakers shoot up to a top 4 seed, then he's right back in the mix.  - Embiid should be in the mix and if someone wanted to place him above Harden because of team record, that's ok.  But hard to see how you could give Embiid votes above Giannis.  In short... Giannis from the East.  Form the West, an inability to go GSW and reluctance to go Jokic, Harden's historic month just in terms of absolute scoring to go along with 9 boards and 7 assists and to keep a team with its 2nd and 3rd best players injured afloat.  I don't think Harden should get it right now... but I didn't think Westbrook should get it 2 years ago.  And I do think 47-35  for the Rockets, if that's where they finished, would be a monumental feet.  Austin Rivers is second in mpg on the team.  Waiver add.  Faried was added and already started 4 games and plays 25+ a night - this is a guy who had only played 2 games in a row the whole season previously once, and only had 1 game with more than 11 minutes the whole season prior and now has put in consecutive games of 37, 36 and 30 minutes.  Danuel House was added from the G League, played 25 mpg, started 12 games, than randomly and surprisingly went poof.  The Carmelo experience was a bust.  Eric Gordon shot 23% on threes out the gate, and 29% in December... he's now up to a ""blistering"" 31.7%.  Capela is out.  Every offseason move of their GM backfired.    I don't think being amazing in light of horrible offseason moves by your GM and keeping an injury riddled team afloat should automatically mean MVP.  I do think Harden gets too much flack in general and not enough people realize what a shit-show of a roster and roster inconsistencies he's working with. Not to mention he's been one of the teams better defenders - which is mind-blowing. "
You guys are already irrelevant. Do you honestly believe a team will ever win a championship with Russell Westbrook as a top 2 option?  
It happens. Look at the OKC duo in 2008-2009:   Russell Westbrook  Kevin Durant  Jeff Green   Nick Collison  Earl Watson      Finished 23-59. 
"&gt;But he's a very efficient player at high usage. People act like he's 2019 Russell Westbrook or something.  His efficiency is bolstered quite a bit by the fact that ""fouls"" like this one aren't considered FGA.  He averages 7.6 fouls drawn and 11.9 FTA per game, if half of those are from flops (which is entirely plausible) that would drop his FG% from .438 to .389, putting him WELL below the league average of .460.  "
"I don't like James Harden's game very much. I find it annoying and boring to watch, and I hate that the NBA is encouraging it. I even still dock him points for that season he completely took off a few years ago because he didn't like Dwight.  That said, Dude isn't inefficient. He's not more efficient than Curry, who is basically the most efficient perimeter player ever. So yeah.   But he's a very efficient player at high usage. People act like he's 2019 Russell Westbrook or something."
"I wouldn't necessarily call him better than nash, they were very different players at their peak. I view j KD as a sort of less athletic precursor to Russell Westbrook and steve nash as the precursor to steph curry. It really depends on what team you build are ok under them and what you want out of your point guard. If I had to pick one I would pick nash but I feel they are close."
"Or Russell ""I'm gonna shut that shit down"" Westbrook "

I think plenty of players can do exactly what Harden is doing right now but they don’t do it because it doesn’t help the team. This is no better than what Russell Westbrook did a few years ago and he  did nothing to make his team better.
"His TS% is dramatically inflated by the volume of FTs he shoots. In terms of his efficiency from the field, it is MUCH lower than that of Steph.   To be honest with his usage rate as high as it is, 8 assists is not that impressive compared to the likes of Russell Westbrook who manages to be averaging a triple double once again despite sharing the offensive load with another MVP candidate."
but then won't they just be disappointed and put off when they see you in person? I'd be kinda peeved if I thought I was drafting Russell Westbrook and JJ Barea came to pick me up 
Russell Westbrook
"You’re delusional my dude, you think his speed is the only factor, it isn’t. If he is accelerating and tripped, his ankle could roll awkwardly or he could land on his knee with an injury history. Take a look at the plays where Russell Westbrook has been injured, this looked more dangerous than the Patrick Beverly one for example. You are making such asinine points that are so off base, a hip check retaliation has to seen in context as a response to a legitimate attempt at injury in a bullshit fashion from behind. "
"Fair enough but I think that's way too high. (no real order) Curry, Westbrook, CP3, Dragic, Simmons, Bledsoe, Lillard, Irving, Conley, Kemba, Lowry, Fox, Russell, Wall, Doncic, Reggie Jackson, Murray, Trae Young, Rubio, Derrick White, Jeff Teague, Darren Collison, Monte Morris, Spencer Dinwiddie. That's 24 point guards. I haven't seen an extensive amount of *all* of these guys play this year but from what I know, I'd take any of these guys over Lonzo right now. He's not even definitively better rn than Kris Dunn, and he's injured just as often. Might throw Patty MIlls in there."
"I started watching basketball relatively late. I mean I was a bulls fans because my dad was back in the 90s when I Was like 8 and was glad he took me to watch him stomp the Grizzlies in his last year. But when I picked OKC it was refreshing to learn about all the good shit Westbrook does off the court. On the court you see this guy who almost tears the rim off when he dunks and would step on the other teams throat to win. Off the court the guy his the epitome of class. Never lets his teammates take the blame for playing poorly, always brings his teammates up, not one teammate that has left has had a bad thing to say about him. Also the story of his best friend dying on the court and Russell showing up to do the chores that his friend would been doing for the mother got me right in the feels.      tldr; I'm gay for Westbrook."
This is it  Fun fact: Russell Westbrook has never won a playoff series as the best player on his team 
"I just got out of a coma, is Russell Westbrook r/nba’s favorite player?"
"Here's a better thought experiment--would Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, or James Harden be able to go a single possession with the basketball without turning it over in 1960? Between strict carry rules and strict travel rules, I doubt it."
Russell Westbrook is the best 3 point shooter in the league dont believe me just watch young one

"&gt;if, say, you had Sam Presti as your general manager and not David Kahn.

I'm obviously a T-Wolves fan but I refuse to hate on Russell Westbrook. Any player who stays with the small market team who drafts them is alright by me (Fuck KD). Hopefully KAT can get some help in the coming years and we can build our mini rivalry into a playoff series.

"This may be a weird comparison, but I could see Russell Westbrook having a similar career arc as Dirk.  Early in careers:  Extremely athletic for position, great scorers.

"Yeah but it doesn't matter because other teams have been going through shit too. Russell Westbrook had knee surgery at the beginning of the season, Chris Paul has had issues with his hamstring again, Kawhi's been getting his load managed like crazy, Denver's had injury issues. If you're going to hypothesize about where the Lakers would be if they weren't injured, you have to give other teams the benefit as well and that means those elite teams the Lakers would leapfrog in your scenario would also get better. The fact is this team could not withstand the grind of the regular season and remain in the playoffs. I could easily say ""b-b-but if Kawhi was healthy, and Lowry didn't have back issues then Toronto would be the 1 seed, not Milwaukee"" but that's some BS. Good teams can withstand moderate injuries.

"You aren't understanding my point. The WNBA is filled with a tiny minority of women who played sports from an early age. This is a relatively new thing, the vast majority of women haven't been and STILL aren't encouraged to play sports. This means that a huge amount of the best female athletes never learned the skilled necessary to play in the NBA. Because culturally, women don't play sports.   I don't think the best female athletes are in the WNBA. I think the WNBA is made up of the tiny amount of women who were encouraged to play sports at a young age and excelled at it.  We have seen the WNBA consistently get better in talent, as each year more girls are encouraged to play sports. It's still a very small amount compared to boys. We still don't see anywhere near the encouragement, it's getting better though, and so is the WNBA.  If US athletes were encouraged to play soccer, we would see an elite US soccer player. But US athletes are encouraged to play basketball and football. Antonio Brown, Russell Westbrook, Steve Nash would all be great soccer players if they had started playing from a young age. This is why the US has never been an elite soccer country.  With females, the best female athletes likely never even tried. They are never encouraged by society.  The absolute best female athletes, the top 0.0001% of that 3.8 billion, likely never played in the WNBA. They weren't encouraged to. There might be 1 or 2, like Britney Griner, but the point is that cultural reasons prevent women from playing.  You keep bringing up the WNBA for some reason even though it is only recently getting better. The vast majority of women are never encouraged to play. If they were, we'd see better WNBA, and imo, eventually, a pro sport level athlete."

"Russell Westbrook spent 2 months in juvenile hall, but after finding basketball as a teen, avoided a life of crime and anger. Because he picked up basketball so late, his fundamentals and IQ are below average still "
Curry and Westbrook seem like the types that will stay with their teams for their entire career. Westbrook's style of play will have father time catching up to him faster than Curry though. So Steph will probably have a longer tenure than Russell
"yeah, but honestly it's kinda of funny that an ""MVP"" talent like Russell Westbrook can't crack 50 wins despite having an All-NBA talent like Paul George beside him.  Almost makes you think Westbrook's stat padding doesn't result in wins."
"Bucks in 4, I'd say in 5 but Blake's been injured. Not much to say, they're the best team.  Raps in 4. Kawhi. Leonard. No more reasons needed. That man is money when it matters the most, look how good he was in his last playoffs. Absolutely great.  Sixers in 5. I was tempted to say in 6, and in fact many people have said there's upset potential, but Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons are great defenders, and if they are locked in they'll give a lot of trouble to the Nets ball handlers (Russell, Dinwiddie and Levert). Yeah, the Sixers have had trouble defending guards all season, but I'm gonna go with Jimmy locking down the opposing point guard. And there's no way the Nets stop Embiid. He'll be cooking.  Celtics in 6. They're just more talented, and Pacers lost their best player. Both are extremely well coached, so don't be surprised to see the Pacers making it a close series, especially without Smart to contain Bogdanovic, but in the end Kyrie Irving is one of the best players in the clutch, Horford is an elite defensive center who'll keep Turner and Sabonis in check, and the Celtics have a better roster.  Warriors in 4. I think I'd be crazy to assume otherwise. It's a team with 5 all stars vs a team with 0 all stars. And apparently Curry hates the Clippers.  Spurs in 7. It could go either way, but I just trust the playoff experience that Aldridge and Pop bring to the table. Probably both teams will win all their home games up until game 7, but it's kind of a coin toss. My guess is that Millsap will be the key for a Nuggets win, as well as Beasley and Lyles being reliable when the starters are resting. As for the Spurs, the big question is if Demar can be the all star he's been the previous couple of regular seasons, and if their guys can make shots, since they haven't been very consistent outside of Bertans.  Thunder in 6. Blazers lost their rim protector, and well they need something better than Kanter to contest Westbrook at the rim. Dame and CJ will probably play exceptionally, especially after last year's fiasco, but the Thunder are better and if MVPG is playing then they'll win. And the Thunder are one of the best defensive teams in the league.  Rockets in 4. Maybe not expected, but they're the better team and Harden has been phenomenal this season and it's likely he continues playing that way. And they're like a Hard counter to the Jazz, who are going to throw different bodies at the guards but they don't really matchup well when the Rockets take Gobert our of the paint."
Russell Westbrook and LeBron really convinced y’all triple doubles happen once a week

"He's clearly a big fan of Russell Westbrook.  Also outside of drafting, OKC hasn't been that well run.  When you lose two MVPs in the span of 4 years, I think you forfeit any ""well run"" title."
"Derrick Rose had the most hype . We were hearing the name ""Derrick Rose"" when he was a junior at Simeon HS. That was the first basketball prospect I remember having Hoopmixtapes  Rose was the consensus #1 recruit, on the cover of magazines etc. Then he went to college and actually delivered, iirc his Memphis team only lost 2 or 3 games the entire season . Rose carried them to the NCAA championship as a freshman, including taking out a stacked UCLA team that had Kevin Love, Darren Collison, Russell Westbrook."
And Russell Westbrook is really good from midrange
"I think it's funny when guys think going to a marquee franchise or NY/LA is going to automatically raise their profile and brand image.   LeBron's brand was at an all-time high when he won as an underdog in Cleveland in 2016. His brand took a huge hit when he failed to meet expectations (not matter how much blame you assign to him) in L.A.   Melo wanted to escape Denver, yet his image as a basketball player and superstar never reached his best years in Denver while he was in New fucking York.  Russell Westbrook is probably the most beloved NBA superstar among the \[12-25 demos\] and he's played his entire career in fucking Oklahoma.   It's a global world now, people love a great narrative, not just the brightest exposure."
I think that is Russell Westbrook.
Top 5 Passers 1. Lebron James 2. Chris Paul 3. James Harden 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Maybe Ben Simmons  Just PGs 1. Chris Paul 2. Ben Simmons 3. Russell Westbrook 4. Ricky Rubio 5. Steph Curry or Dame
"Jeanie​ Buss​ was ready​ to let the​ Magic happen –​ again.  The​ Lakers​ owner​ knew that Luke​ Walton’s​ fate​ was​ hanging in​​ the balance, how her front office that was led by Magic Johnson truly believed that much of what ailed them in this disastrous debut season with LeBron James fell at the young coach’s feet, and that was just fine by her. The final choice, as she had told Johnson and others in the days leading up to his stunning resignation on Tuesday, was theirs to make.  She wouldn’t intervene. She wouldn’t push back. If that’s what Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka wanted, then so be it. They had earned her trust by landing LeBron in the first place last summer, and maybe that chasm that existed between Walton and the men who controlled the roster was too big to bridge. She had total confidence in the people who held the most basketball power.  End-of-season meetings would be had. Important decisions would be made. That was the plan.  And then, before that hammer actually fell, Earvin headed for the exits.  What an embarrassment.  There’s no other way to describe Johnson’s choice here, this move that will cost the Lakers so dearly after these past two years of brand rebuilding. He didn’t have the heart to tell Jeanie before going to the media.  “Somebody is going to have to tell my boss, because I know she’s going to be sick,” Johnson admitted to reporters. “But I know I couldn’t face her face to face and tell her, even though I was just with her yesterday and we had a three-hour meeting about the direction of this great organization. So today, Rachel, I’m free my love.”  He was talking to ESPN’s Rachel Nichols, who later followed up with Johnson during a one-on-one near the Staples Center loading dock.  “So you told us first because you didn’t want her to talk you out of it?” Nichols asked Johnson.  “Exactly,” he replied.  He didn’t have the professionalism to tell LeBron, a source close to James confirmed, forcing one of the greatest players of all time to learn about Johnson’s decision through the media. Never mind, as the source also confirmed, that LeBron had met with Johnson, Pelinka, and his agent, Rich Paul, on Saturday to discuss the future of the franchise without even a hint that this was coming. Three days later, Johnson was engaging in a 40-minute public therapy session with reporters that only sparked more questions about what he had done.  So let’s get this straight. You wanted to congratulate Russell Westbrook on his recent 20-20-20 night, and to retain the freedom to say things like that to non-Lakers players without fear of tampering charges from the NBA, so badly that you decided to dive off the runway that was cleared for you in Feb. 2017 when Jeanie fired her brother, Jim Buss, and longtime GM Mitch Kupchak? That’s about as believable as the idea that Walton was the one who inspired all the curious roster moves last summer which led to this mess.  In the days leading up to Johnson’s departure, this was a real story that was floating around Laker Land. Despite Johnson having told the world otherwise at NBA Summer League in Las Vegas last July, where he sat for nearly 20 minutes on ESPN describing why and how players like Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley and Rajon Rondo became Lakers, history was being re-written in some circles.  Walton, some people of Lakers prominence had suggested, had wanted to play LeBron off the ball and thus sparked all those moves that didn’t pan out. Sources with knowledge of Walton’s thinking pushed back vehemently on this suggestion – as if the public record wasn’t enough to quell the notion on its own. Walton, quite clearly, was being made out to be the fall guy.  The re-framing of it all was as big a red flag for Walton as he had endured all season long, which is saying something considering the context. After all, this is the same coach who was read the riot act by his bosses seven games in.  “Shut the fuck up,” Johnson had told Walton when he tried to interject during their infamous Oct. 30 meeting that also included Pelinka, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.  Five months later, Johnson tried to downplay the severity of his early message.  “I think everybody blew that up,” he told reporters. “They over-blew it. Sometimes as a president, you have to have a tough meeting with a coach. We had a tough meeting. And after that, it was fine. And it’s been fine. I haven’t had any problems with Luke. People think we’ve had problems, but we haven’t had any problems. Just because I want us to be better and I want him to be better? If I had come back, we all had to be better, right? I’ve made mistakes myself. But also too, everybody had to be better. And that’s what it’s all about. But that’s my job, to demand that.”  While Johnson didn’t claim to know what Jeanie might ultimately decide about Walton, it’s safe to say his exit improves the odds of him continuing as Lakers coach. He signed a five-year, $25 million deal in late April of 2016 that is guaranteed through next season.  “It’s the right thing to do, the right move to make,” Johnson said of his decision. “And then that way, (Walton) can stay in place, hopefully build the team, coach the team the right way, and also, all the – what I didn’t like was the backstabbing and the whispering. I don’t like that. You know, I don’t like a lot of things that went on that didn’t have to go on. And so I hope that after tomorrow, the Lakers can head in the right direction – which we are.”  And then, of course, there was the ESPN elephant in the room. For months, there had been rumblings that the Worldwide Leader was working on a story which would be extremely unflattering for Johnson and that focused on his mistreatment of employees. When asked by The Los Angeles Times if that entered his personal calculus, he denied that it played a part.  “An article would never make Magic Johnson do something he don’t want to do,” he said, according to our Lakers beat writer, Bill Oram, who was there during the interaction. “I know me. Ask people who deal with me – ask them. They’ve been around me for 40 years. … Same dude I was when I first got off the bus. Never disrespected nobody, never did anything bad. Now, am I tough? Hell yeah I am. You work for me, I’m demanding. That’s who I am.  “But at the same time, I’m fair. (Is) an article going to stop – make me do something? No. I’m good. They’ve been talking about that article for how many months? (Laughs) Everybody run up, ‘Oh they writing an article.’ OK. Great. I’m going (to) say ‘Why didn’t you interview everybody at ESPN? You know how many times ESPN hired me? Twice. If I was doing something wrong to employees, disrespecting, you think they would have hired me twice? No. I know that article is not an accurate article. I can tell you that now. …Now it’s some disgruntled, former Laker employees (talking to reporters). Yeah, they gonna say (what) they gonna say, ‘cause they wasn’t doing their jobs. So what is a person going to do? Point the finger bad about the person who fired them. I’m good. I’m a big boy.”  It wasn’t the first time the media had become part of the internal conversation.  As The Athletic reported on Tuesday morning, the report from ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith in early February that Magic had been overruled by Jeanie on the June 2017 decision to draft Lonzo Ball second overall out of UCLA instead of Kentucky’s De’Aaron Fox was enough to cause consternation between the owner and the team’s top executive. Magic had made it clear to Jeanie that he wasn’t the one spreading that message, but the mere fact that they were expending energy on these sorts of situations was not a good thing when it came to the interpersonal dynamics that are always so crucial.  As for the Lakers’ (still) uncertain future, here’s what we know for sure. First and foremost, a decision must be made on both Walton and Pelinka.  “That’s a decision that Jeanie has to make,” Johnson told reporters about Pelinka, who is the former agent of retired Lakers great Kobe Bryant who had no previous front office experience before his March 2017 hiring. “I worked well with him. I had no problems with him. …Jeanie has to make all the calls.”  If you’re Jeanie, it’s time to make lemonade out of lemons. Leverage the Lakers brand – battered though it might be – to recruit the best in the front office business heading into this crucial summer. There is still time to send the right sort of message to this latest free agency crop, with stars like Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and all the rest watching closely here like all the rest of us.  Elite players want to be in Los Angeles, and to wear the glorious purple and gold. What they don’t want, and what they have every reason to fear after seeing the latest Lakers saga, is to join a storied franchise that has lost its way again."
"Draymond Green - Great defensive player but it was nothing consistent where he could shut All Star players down all game like Rodman, Kawhi, Pippen could do, he is undersized and guys like Anthony Davis among others would still get their averages. Green is a product of the Warriors system, the same way many players from the Suns were from the 24 SOL era. If he were drafted anywhere else, he'd be average.   &amp;#x200B;  Russell Westbrook - I just hate this guy so i'm a bit bias here, but he's extremely inconsistent with his shot, arrogant and cocky. Great athletic player, maybe one of the best we've seen at his position so I wouldn't consider him overrated but he sure isn't a winner and even with Paul George, you'll see the Thunder falter in the 1st or 2nd round."

He can even tweet Russell Westbrook now
"That playoff run as a whole was absolutely crazy. The number of superstars he had to defeat on his way.  LaMarcus Aldridge, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade and LeBron James. That’s a crazy list of hall of famers and two of the teams he played had THREE each."
"I'm not completely disregarding advanced stats. Just every single one of them is flawed and we should consider those flaws.   For example PER; PER assumes 15.000 is the league average in that season. But PER doesn't disclose what that average is. Moses Malone led the league in his b2b MVP seasons. But his PER were 26.8 and 25.1. Those numbers can not touch current league bests. But just that about ratings. It's also flawed about ranking because it tends value more players with higher usage rates.   Comparing Win Share is flawed because the point of WS is to near actual win number of the team. You should WS explanation in bkref. Russell Westbrook wasn't behind of anybody in 2016-17 season in terms of individual numbers. But his team couldn't get 58+ wins and that's why his WS number is lower than recent MVPs. And WS/48 is a direct linear adjustment to overall WS number. They are basically the same thing.   BPM has a very high standard deviation from statistical point of view.      I can get behind of comparing PER rating and ranking players for a particular season and it'll provide me some level of context. But not the whole picture.      Currently I use Efficiency number with a next level of detail.   Efficiency number is calculated with this; (Pts + trb + ast + stl + blk) - (fg missed + ft missed + tov)   I know this is also flawed with the weightings. Efficiency also considers raw numbers which is important because pace adjustments are linear and linear adjustments aren't good. I mean Duncan scored 25.5 ppg in 2001-02 season for example. If he kept his mpg but played 100 possessions in a game rather than slow pace, he'd be scoring 28.3 ppg. But is that accurate? I think not. Not that he's not capable, if he played in this era he wouldn't be gunning for 28+ as long as his team gets the win and I think his team would get the win. Anyway I'm getting off topic.   I took Eff number to next level. I compare it to team's Eff number in that season. That gives me an percentage. For instance; Larry Bird averaged 34.39 efficiency in 1984-85 regular season and his team averaged 135.62 efficiency. That's 25.36% impact.   I rely on this to determine how much a player had to carry. I wouldn't label it as determining the best or the most dominant. But it's good context to see how much a player meant to his team with a percentage.       Sorry for the long post. Hope I hope I managed to explain myself properly because English isn't my native language."
"Westbrook is nowhere near the player he was in advanced stats. Harden is not a statistical leader in aggregate stats.  You cannot use counting stats to determine a statistical leader. He is out blocked and out rebounded by a mile yet you choose PPG to define leadership. This is inane. Maybe Bill Russell should not have won all his MVPs because of his low PPG, neither should Nash...  Try to use aggregate stats to determine the statistical play. Harden is not winning in those (wins some loses in some)"

He left because Russell Westbrook got 20-20-20 and he couldn’t say congrats lmao I’m dead
"TIL: Russell Westbrook and Steph Curry play in the Eastern Conference.  Come on man, you can at least pretend to read my comments."
"What? Derrick Rose definitely did this and was technically like half a year younger than Russell.  Some other players that did at the same age as Russell:  * Magic * Isiah Thomas * Oscar Robertson * Chris Paul * Russell Westbrook * Stephon Marbury (he also did it at age 21, so he was actually younger that Russell)"
I repeat: I’m telling you that this is a below average shooting game for any above average NBA player and an above average shooting game for Russell Westbrook.
My name is Frankalicious47 and I thought Mudiay was going to be the next Russell Westbrook
You can always rely on March-April Elfrid “Russell Westbrook”Payton.
"Well, with everything you said.  &gt; Harden is doing a historic carry job.  To which he replied.  &gt; Not really, the Rockets teams don't struggle that much without him.  This is a direct response to your statement that Harden is in the middle of a historic carry job. The implication of a carry job is that your team is so bad without you on the floor that you need to make up for their inadequacies while you're on the floor. For example, Russell Westbrook had an absurd carry job the year he won MVP. His team was almost 12 points worse when he was on the bench, 8.5 points below the other team.   Harden's On/Off difference is +4.8, which is a fairly significant difference. Especially when you take into context the amount of minutes he plays, since his team's numbers would be slightly better as a result of him playing most minutes against starters. However his team is still average when he sits. Much better with him playing, but not a collosal black hole as would be implied by saying he was doing a historic carry job.  What Harden is doing is elevating a mediocre team and making it great. There's a fairly massive and incredibly important distinction between those two things. What LeBron did in last years playoffs? That was a carry job."
"Watch this:   Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, and Russell Westbrook are the only players to average 24/10/8.   Therefore Jokic must be inferior."
Russell Westbrook shoots below 40% from the field throughout the playoffs.
"&gt; Russell Westbrook averaged a triple-double!  Honestly, that should be enough to justify Westbrook winning this year's MVP award.  [sauce](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/russell-westbrook-has-the-one-vote-for-mvp-that-matters-041317)"
"Steph Curry, James Harden  Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving  Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson  All deserve to be in ahead of him imo. I don't get why they would vote for him. He's the main reason the spurs offense is so much better but he's also part of the reason the defense is worse."
"But they do often win.   Michael Jordan*   Karl Malone   Shaquille O'Neal*   Allen Iverson*   Tim Duncan x2   Kevin Garnett   Steve Nash* x2   Dirk Nowitzki*   Kobe Bryant*   LeBron James* x4   Derrick Rose*   Kevin Durant*   Stephen Curry* x2   Russell Westbrook*   James Harden*    Those are the winners of MVP in the last 20 years. Out of all of those, only 3 (karl malone, kevin garnett, and tim duncan) defense was a significant contribution to their argument. The idea that MVP is not about offensive production is just wrong, when you look at the asterisked seasons."
"This is absolutely the best thing for Draymond and Golden State.  Draymond is absolutely going to be a man on a mission mode during the playoffs.  On the other hand, no so good for OKC.  Russell Westbrook is going full hero-ball mode and chucking up 30 footers."
Russell Westbrook as The Ninja Turtles
Russell Westbrook would like a word
"Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, maybe Carmelo Anthony. Russell Westbrook. Paul George. Damian Lilliard. And it would be very entertaining to have Embid"
Ok so watch James harden say yes. Russell Westbrook. Embiid for sure. Ben Simmons and shit it might be KD
"This survey is pure gold. There are so many subjects where I have an opinion on or just went Whoah!  &gt; Who’s the most overrated? (47 votes) &gt; * Draymond Green, Russell Westbrook (17%) &gt; * Jimmy Butler, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns (6.3%)  I love to see that his peers see Draymond as the same overrated prick as I do. Also nice that the Twolves Triumvirate is in second place.  &gt; Who’s the most underrated? (116 votes) &gt; * Jrue Holiday (16.3%) &gt; * Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton (6.8%)  I really like Dame but isn't he overrated at this point, when everybody says he is underrated.  &gt; Who’s the best defender? (114 votes) &gt; ... &gt; * Klay Thompson, **Torrey Craig**, Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart (1.7%)  First I thought that the players a trolling once again but then I checked Torrey Craig. Wow he is a nice rotation player for the Nuggets and I never heard of him before. Also he earned multiple defensive awards in his pre-NBA career. I really have to step my NBA watch game up this season. Really did the Wiggins this season and floated in and out of it.  &gt; Who don’t you want to fight? (Or just ‘Who’s the toughest?’) (105 votes) &gt; * James Johnson (43.8%)  The question isn't exact, right? I don't WANT to fight James Johnson if I didn't lose my mind.  &gt; Where will Kevin Durant be playing next season? (109 votes) &gt; * New York (63.3%)  As a Knicks fan....Y-E-S!"

"I said this in r/bostonceltics (re Pierce's comments), Wade has three playoff appearances without Shaq or Lebron.   * Two first-round exits (2009, 2010) * One second-round exit (2016)  Yes he was better than Pierce, but he isn't better than Harden.   As *the guy* Harden has arguably had more playoff success than Solo-Wade ever did. Harden's only crimes are:  1. Not playing with Shaq or Lebron  2. The Holocaust  &amp;nbsp;  Harden is an MVP and by the end of this season, we could make the argument that he's had the career of a 3-4 time MVP.   He's won one MVP and come second in two historic MVP races (Curry and Westbrook) and realistically he could win the MVP this season as well.   This year, he's put up an offensive season we objectively haven't seen since Jordan's best year and arguably is even better than Jordan's best year (lower ppg but much higher efficiency and assist numbers).  He's beaten a lot of the *unbreakable* records of legends like Kobe and Nate Archibald.   * The first NBA player to both score and assist on 2,000 points in a single season.  * The first player in NBA history to record at least 2,000 points, 900 assists, and 600 rebounds in a single season * One of five players in NBA history to average at least 29 points, 7 assists, 6 rebounds in a single season.  * Includes Oscar Robertson (achieved this seven times), Lebron James (achieved this twice), Michael Jordan, and Russell Westbrook. * The only player in the history of NBA alongside Wilt Chamberlain to score at least 30 points in 20 consecutive games. * He has the 10th highest scoring season of all time * Plus a whole lot I'm sure I'm forgetting. There are so many stats that now have Wilt #1 and then Harden/MJ competing for #2-3  IMO, right now he's challenging Kobe for the #2 spot for all-time SGs and the only way he doesn't beat Wade is if you count Harden as a PG instead.  &gt;Wade's 2005-2006 playoff run surpasses that handily,  If Harden had a 28 / 5 / 5 playoff run he would be labelled a choker.  Hell he had 28 / 5 / 7-8 in the past two years and has been labelled a choker..."

That explains the Westbrook who is wholesome/ great with kids and the Westbrook who wants to bite your head off.  Russell Westbrook and Wussell Restbrook are two different people after all
"Love the effort that went into this, but missing Brody for Russell Westbrook"
"Hey, looks like you might have misread the article. No worries.  Here's an article to read about the altercation in question: https://footwearnews.com/2019/focus/athletic-outdoor/jordan-brand-athlete-russell-westbrook-lashes-out-at-fan-for-allegedly-racial-comments-1202759743/   Quote:  &gt;the young man and the wife in the stands told me to get down on my knees ‘like you’re used to.'  Kyle spoke about it because it was another instance where his default reaction was, ""Well, fans heckle, not a big deal"" when in fact it can be incredibly hurtful to anyone to be bombarded with this sort of thing. Kyle's privilege made it such that he had not considered the fact that Russell's reaction may have been just. Kyle has never had to deal with that before; and never will.  Does that make you reconsider your viewpoint at all?"
"There are 33 qualifying players with 20ppg.  Westbrook is 3.2% behind 2nd to last place, Russell.  Wanna know how big a gap 3.2% is?  33rd to 32nd = 3.2  32nd to 25th = 2.7  25th to 13th = 3.1  13th to 4th = 3.2  4th to 1st = 2.2  Normally the top scorers are close enough in efficiency that improving by 3 percentage points gives you a nice bump on the list.  For Westbrook that bump would be tied for last instead of last."
"I tried to be unbiased and present stats that might contribute to MVP narratives. I must disclaim that I began this investigation by asking myself ""Why did Russell Westbrook win MVP in 2017?"", which is why clutch stats are on there. So I can see why that might be considered bias. But other than that, I tried to present as many sides as I could think of that can be presented in numbers like this. Obviously, omitted are the more ""narrative"" elements like the triple-double average."
"and even that one wasnt that big of a mistake lol.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y1=2017&amp;player_id1=westbru01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id2_select=James+Harden&amp;y2=2017&amp;player_id2=hardeja01&amp;idx=players  Russ beat harden ina  lot of advanced statistics, including having the highest PER of all time"
Wait... so Russell Westbrook won both Player of the Week and Most Overrated Player in the League? How!?
Russell Westbrook has a higher % of getting a triple double than making a fg
"Self selection for players who are willing to make a vote for ""most overrated,"" i.e. ""haters."" I haven't seen a compelling explanation for why Russell Westbrook is significantly more hated by this group of players than the general population of players.  In this smaller pool, he only garnered ~8.5%. That's not some dramatically outsized proportion of votes."
"nope, it's no longer an attempt when it's below the rim, it's a loose ball waiting for russell westbrook to rebound it at that point"
"No, you simply don't understand what you are actually asking for. You are thinking ""ah, this side is physically larger than the other one, so it isn't fair"", but there is a sneaky problem with that:   Lets say you are making a map of a square state. The map should be square as well to make it 1:1, right?  e.g. 0-100 miles on the x, 0-100 miles on the y axis.   It's simple to see what the correct ratios for producing those plots are because we are comparing distance with distance, but that goes away once we use other units.  Well now lets say you make a physically square chart with ""TS%"" and ""points scored"". What should the range be here for it to be ""accurate"" 50-70 TS% to 20-40 points? 0-70 TS% to 30-40 points? 40-55 TS% to 10-150 points?   All of those can be fit into a physically square chart, but none are more correct than the other because there is no 1:1 conversion between TS% and points. They aren't the same units. So that means I can stretch and pull the chart in any way to make Harden or Curry look more like an outlier and still make the chart physically square. Physically making the chart square as we see it on the monitor is just covering up the real issue that 1 TS% != 1 point.    You see what I mean?  There are some potential solutions however. One fairish and simple way to do it is to rescale each value by the mean and standard deviation of the data. I did that here if you want. Then since each axis is ""Standard deviations away from the norm"" we can compare them 1:1 like people want to:  if you absolutely must compare Harden and Curry we can make up some metric that at least makes some semblance of sense by normalizing the values to the mean and std of the distributions:  Points per 70 possessions has a mean of 14.3 and a standard deviation of 4.1.   Adjusted TS% has a mean of 53.28% and a standard deviation of 4.86%  ---  Harden in 2019 has a pp70 of 34.1 and an adjTS% of 62.4%. So that means Hardens ppg is 4.83 standard deviations above the mean and his adjustedTS% is 1.88 stddev above the mean.     Curry in 2019 has a pp70 of 29.2 and a adjTS% of 67.6%. So that means Curry's ppg is 3.63 standard deviations above the mean and his adjustedTS% is 2.95 stddev above the mean.    Doing that for every player we get this plot which can be considered ""square"".

"&gt; Not more than Embiid.  Ok? Polls aren't an exact science. And people hate for reasons other than beef. Like I'd assume most people in Houston don't like Russ for stealing an MVP from Harden even though Russ historically doesn't beef with Houston players.  &gt; If 450 NBA players answered the poll, why do you think that significantly less than ~8.5% would answer Westbrook?  I've already explained this. Because haters are more likely to answer this question than others, it's probable that the amount of Russ haters in this sample is not proportionate to the amount of Russ haters in the NBA.   &gt; Would it actually shock you if 38 out of 450 NBA Players answered ""Russell Westbrook"" if asked to name who they think is most overrated in the league?  It wouldn't shock me, but I would be a bit surprised.   I'm done talking so much with you about a simple bias in a statistic. You keep repeating the same questions as though I haven't already answered them. If you don't understand what I'm saying here, go take a statistics class."

If 450 NBA players answered the poll, why do you think that significantly less than ~8.5% would answer Westbrook?  Would it actually shock you if 38 out of 450 NBA Players answered ""Russell Westbrook"" if asked to name who they think is most overrated in the league?"
"I'm not saying there is explicitly a bias in people wanting to select Russell Westbrook. But consider the following:   - this survey question had noticeably fewer responses than the others  - players are likely guided by vindictiveness or dislike when voting a player for an obviously negative title - 90% of the sample decided not to vote - a third of the sample voted for two players     As a data analyst, and someone who studied research and survey design, those are red flags. There's ample opportunity here for selection bias. We have on one hand, most players likely not voting for a title they see as purely vindictive and mean spirited and a handful of players voting for two people. These two people are known to have as many people who dislike them than as friends.      This results in a situation where you're likely to have people who vote, vote for players who they have beefed with the most. On the other hand, it seems less likely that you would vote if you're more indifferent to that player or believe the question to be unsporting. Those players would be more likely to select an objectively over-rated player than one they feel dislike towards, yet they likely don't vote because they see the question as poor sportsmanship or otherwise."
"Why would there be self-selection bias that is expressed, specifically, as selecting for the specific players who think Russ is overrated?  Why would detractors of Russell Westbrook be more likely to answer the question than detractors of other NBA players?  And does this also mean that the poll results also indicate self-selection of Draymond Green detractors?"
"I think BBIQ is rarely the deciding factor in what kind of offense a team runs. At the NBA level and with enough coaching and practice, all of them can run just about any offense, mentally-speaking. It's much more about fit and player skill set, what makes sense for the roster you've got.   Russell Westbrook doesn't make sense in a motion offense because he can't shoot, so he's a limited off-ball threat. James Harden is the best isolation scorer in the game, so it makes sense to surround him with shooters and run endless pick and roll variants. Giannis is a nightmare in space, so the Bucks' spread offense works perfectly for him."
"You're building a roster from scratch: Who are you signing first? (125 votes) Giannis Antetokounmpo (36.4%) Anthony Davis (10.4%) Joel Embiid (8.8%) Kevin Durant (8%) LeBron James (7.6%) Steph Curry (6.4%) Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard (3.2%) Luka Doncic (2.4%) Jayson Tatum, Paul George, Trae Young, Nikola Jokic, Russell Westbrook (1.6%) James Harden, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kyrie Irving, DeMarcus Cousins, **Udonis Haslem**, Shaquille Harrison, Jrue Holiday (1%)"
"&gt; How are players overrating a player they play against.  Because players aren't watching most games and aren't in a position to keep up with most players in the league. They mostly focus on themselves, their team, and draw conclusions about other players by a) playing with them or against them or b) by knowing them off the court, which is irrelevant to how they play on the court.  Players across all sports are generally not great at evaluating talent because that's not what their job is. I'm sure Russell Westbrook thinks Andrew Wiggins is a pretty decent basketball player because Andrew Wiggins plays really well against the Thunder."
"Russell Westbrook now has 3 straight seasons of averaging a triple double. The first season earned him MVP, in his 3rd season he probably won't make many voters ballot...but why...he is more likely to get a triple double than he is to make a basket 44% triple double rate compared to 43% shooting."

Russell Westbrook is a good point guard. 
"Never forget sam presti turned a team with kevin durant, russell westbrook, and james harden into Russell Westbrook and a bag of fritos because he didnt want to keep james harden for an extra year for already commited money"
"Drives per game:  2014-15 ————— Westbrook = 15 Harden = 13.9   2015-16 ————— Westbrook = 16.1 Harden = 14.5  2016-17 ————— Westbrook = 20.1 Harden = 17.1  2017-18 ————— Westbrook = 19.3 Harden = 17.1  2018-19 ————— Westbrook = 18.2 Harden = 19.7   I don’t think even you believe Harden is a more physical player than Russell Westbrook. I don’t like how he draws fouls but that doesn’t make the numbers biased, there’s no real reason that two players who attack the rim at nearly the same rate over 5 years should have a 1000 FTA disparity between them, especially when it’s a guy like James Harden vs a guy like Russel Westbrook.   He gets calls that others don’t, plain and simple. If you want to believe that he’s so much further advanced than everyone else at something that he can’t even decide and that’s in the referees control, that it leads to a 1k free throw disparity, then there’s not much else I can say "
"The 10-15 is great! I’m telling you that this is a below average shooting game for any above average NBA player and an above average shooting game for Russell Westbrook. Cut his shots, give him a prime Rondo-role"
"I dunno man, when he was on OKC, and people were would shit talk his Twitter about Russell Westbrook being better, his response was, ""we're on the same team."" I don't think he's offended, proly happy for Curry."

"I just don’t get these comments, you really think adding Russell Westbrook is gonna suddenly make them bad and not win with 4 other all star caliber players ? He plays off ball and lets PG do his own thing all the time, and I think curry has a higher usage than him this year. Just uninformed"

"Westbrook is great player reaching his potential. I think both Curry MVP season better than Russ. Westbrook athleticism off the charts, long wingspan, and combine with his effort level each time he is on the court is special. He still makes those critical turnovers throughout the game, but he will always come back to score and make plays, because of his talent. This playoff and next playoff will be critical to see how good Westbrook really is as the best player on the team. He hasn’t pass the 1st round of the playoffs, and he is 30 years old. Russell Westbrook did say to a reporter the stat he cares about Wins."
"you nailed it. that's always been one of my biggest hangups.   ""russ just got MVP because people are obsessed with stats, but here's 20 stats to prove he didn't deserve it''  anyone who watched those game saw what Russ was doing. We had a lead, usually double digits, every time he went on in that Houston series. it was gone by the time he came back in. it was like that year.   and of course, people still claimed that was Russ's fault, since ya know him holding the ball meant these fucking NBA caliber players somehow didn't have the confidence to even shoot when he was off the court....especially a guy like Oladipo who during the season would kill it when Russ was out, but hard a really rough series. People would say Oladipo played better without russ, then when he played like doodoo in the playoffs they said it was because he had been playing with russ.   next season he's traded and blows up in indiana. who does oladipo help credit his ascension? russell westbrook. "
what if Russell westbrook never knew his own mentality?
"As everything in the sub, it's comically exaggerated. I don't know what logic people see in both saying that Russell Westbrook is fantastic because he gets so many assists, and that he is even more fantastic because people miss all the shots when he passes to them. That's exactly the opposite of what the high number of assists and points from assists means! It means they make them!   &amp;#x200B;  The amount of points per potential assist is the same for Westbrook, CP3, John Wall, LeBron, Harden etc. How is the main conclusion people have from that that ""it shows bad OKC missess all the shots Westbrook gives them!"".  &amp;#x200B;  Of course he is a fantastic creator, but this thread is a very strange way to put it in words. It's like, for a few years now, the competition in NBA is about who has the worst teammates. And does the most ""carry job"". Everyone is auctioning that player X has the worst teammates, like that's the main achievement."
"I think Russell Westbrook is an above average passer. The numbers are great but he still has to get his turnovers down cause he still plays out of control sometimes which leads to those turnovers. That being said, if he can fix some of those issues, he really has the potential to average 12-14 maybe 15 a game."
He's just clearly not the best and I don't think when he retires he will be anywhere close still. Chris Paul and Steph Curry are both better team mates (that are currently playing) than him. Westbrook fights his own team mates for rebounds. Is that what a good team mate is? Westbrook will take unnecessary deep 3's instead of passing the ball. Is that what a good team mate is?   You claim that this wasn't a praise Russell thread when clearly it is. And like the other guy who responded to this comment it's a very silly thread. Good day sir. 
"I didn't know Russell Westbrook ceased to exist.. Giannis is long and athletic, but he is most definitely not the most athletic star. People tend to confuse his length for athleticism.  Also, I don't even get this. Curry is aging, but he's still more proven as a player in the playoffs and it's not like he's regressed. Saying you'll take Giannis, when he has yet to make it past the first round, is a bit foolhardy."
"&gt;I'd put Russell Westbrook in there too, 4 years 171 million left he's extremely reliant on his athleticism and turns 31 in November  True but it's not like players suddenly become dogshit after they hit a certain age. They regress slowly. I'm sure Westbrook will maintain a high level of athleticism until 2021 \~ 2022 at least. He averaged a triple double this season. We'll have to see how he plays but I'd rather bet on him than against him "

"Um excuse me. Have you seen Russell Westbrook pull up from 3 with 21 left on the shot clock, flop for a foul, and then hard foul his opponent in transition instead of getting back on defense? That's a thing of beauty"
"I don't see Chris Paul winning a ring as a starter. He's one of those guys that seem like they can't win a championship: Steve Nash, Dwight Howard, Russell Westbrook, etc."
"I can't remember why, but Russell Westbrook doesn't like Embiid, so he must be a bitch."
"As I say all the time in here, good for Russell Westbrook not giving NBA media cancer sound bites to do this shit with. It’s unbelievable how one of the biggest leagues in the world can have by far the worst media in the sports world and it isn’t even close. No league on earth comes close to how bad nba media is"
"Well, I will say that PER and other box score related stats do tend to overrate guys like Jokic and Westbrook a bit due to their ability to get assists and boards.  There were plenty of articles during his MVP season written that basically said “Did Russell Westbrook break PER?” so, grain of salt and all that (for Jokic as well)."
Shoutout to constantly hated on Russell Westbrook in the top 20 all-time after a ton of playoff appearances. It's like maybe he's not so bad?

Khelcey straight up dropped dead in a game. [Here's a good article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xzq49/russell-westbrook-the-legacy-of-khelcey-barrs) about KB and Russ.
"You can only make that statement if the warriors lose, which isn’t happening.   Furthermore, the sixers just lost due in large part to the health (or lack there of) of embiid, and many have said they ran his body into the ground too much in this years regular season.   The same could be said for Paul George and Russell Westbrook.    TLDR: nah...the health of my super stars &gt; playing one more game at home in a best of seven series"
"I want to see every NBA player treat these cancerous NBA reporters' gotcha soundbite questions like this, just like how Russell Westbrook does. The smugness of this guy ""LOL WHERE'S THE PROCESS NOW DUDE""  Seriously, i know you guys hate the way Westbrook answers questions but maybe if every NBA player did that shit, just ignore these reporters clown gotcha questions, they would actually start to make an effort to ask hard-hitting questions instead of trying to make everything into a sound bite beef creator like everything the NBA media cancer does."
Those are Russell Westbrook numbers
"Trailblazers playoff run has been fucking anime.  Round 1 is the ""Dame Lillard vs Russell Westbrook"" arc.  Round 2 is the ""Rise of CJ McCollum"" arc.  Round 3 is now the underdog arc highlighted by the ""Li'l bro vs big bro"" Curry clash."
The truth is this game is exactly why Lillard is better the Russell. He is able to recognize when he is off and to work on other things like passing defense and rebounding while his running mate takes care of the rest. Westbrook instead gets more bullish and try’s to shoot his way out of slumps

"Your a Bulls fan, I get where your line of thinking is, but you are in the minority.   Russell Westbrook and Derrick Rose pretty much had identical stats that year. OKC won 55 games in a much harder conference. Yeah they had Durant. What about the fact that Rose was 9th in PER that year? The Bulls were good that year, Rose was great that year, but it was just voter fatigue and people made at Lebron leaving.   You might be young but MJ was snubbed multiple times, 86-87, 88-89 , 89-90. Shaq was snubbed and so on. The year Westbrook won was an abomination.   Your only argument for Rose winning is they had the best record in the East, a very weak East where below 500 teams make it to the playoffs. That accomplishment would have meant a lot more if Lebron didn’t dominate them in the Playoffs."

imagine asking russell westbrook that. lol next question.
"What are you smoking? Westbrook took more FGA than both LeBron and KD. Harden was trash too. He went up against a top 3 player of all time that had a better team. MJ tHE GoAt 6-0. By your logic, Bill Russell has a better case than MJ."
"A few things that I no longer want to read on Reddit:  OKC would've won a championship by now, if it had been James Harden and Kevin Durant that remained.  OKC should've traded Russell Westbrook instead of James Harden.  Russell shouldn't have won his MVP as proved by his playoff performances.  Houston has routinely built better teams around James than OKC has in general, and in particular as of late around Russell, and James still can't even get to the WCF against teams that are missing their best player.  I don't even care about the Rockets downvote brigade that I am about to endure."

"Lol at you.  The part that's odd for Steph, like why does that mean there has to be some beef between us? He loves LeBron, he respects LeBron, and he's like ... 'Because the outside world is pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us? I thought we were cool.' ""That's the question that's in Curry's mind and Curry's camp: 'Why do you not like me when all I did was basically respect everything you did and kind of follow the model you carried out?' So there's an interesting dynamic there, and it's not just with LeBron. ""Steph wants to be accepted by all these guys. This is what he worked for - for you to say, 'Man, you're one of us.' It seems like they don't want to give that to him. Not yet, anyway.""   SPORTS LeBron James and some of the NBA's biggest stars have reportedly had a 'disdain' toward Stephen Curry that he doesn't understand Scott Davis Jun 3, 2018, 3:27 PM ET lebron steph Ezra Shaw/Getty  Stephen Curry is a respected and popular player in the NBA, but some of the league's other top stars, including LeBron James, have been irritated by his rise, according to a 2017 report. Some NBA stars reportedly felt annoyed by Curry's rise and the fact he seemed immune to criticism from the sports world. Curry was reportedly aware of this feeling and was confused by it, feeling he had proved himself as one of the NBA's best players. Stephen Curry is one of the best, most respected, and most popular players in the NBA, but his quick rise in the league reportedly rubbed some of his peers the wrong way.  In 2017, Marcus Thompson of The Athletic, author of the book ""Golden: The Miraculous Rise of Steph Curry,"" explained to ""The Big Lead with Jason McIntyre"" that Curry was not all that popular with some of the league's biggest stars, including LeBron James.  ""There's this thing there with he and LeBron that's a little weird,"" Thompson said.  According to Thompson, James and Curry were close from Curry's days at Davidson to his early years in the league. Thompson said James was ""like a mentor"" to Curry, but as Curry's game improved, coinciding with the Warriors' rise, he ""challenged LeBron's status."" Since then, the two apparently haven't been as close, and it reportedly bothers Curry.  Thompson said:   ""The part that's odd for Steph, like why does that mean there has to be some beef between us? He loves LeBron, he respects LeBron, and he's like ... 'Because the outside world is pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us? I thought we were cool.' ""That's the question that's in Curry's mind and Curry's camp: 'Why do you not like me when all I did was basically respect everything you did and kind of follow the model you carried out?' So there's an interesting dynamic there, and it's not just with LeBron. ""Steph wants to be accepted by all these guys. This is what he worked for - for you to say, 'Man, you're one of us.' It seems like they don't want to give that to him. Not yet, anyway."" During the 2016 Finals, the second rematch between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers, things got noticeably heated between James and Curry as James' Cavs came roaring back and eventually won the series.  In Game 6, James swatted one of Curry's shots and trash-talked him afterward. The two had bumped each other a few times and exchanged words. Finally, Curry was called for a foul, lost his cool, chucked his mouthguard, which hit a fan, and was ejected. From there, the ""beef"" seemed real.  It resurfaced on Thursday in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, when the two exchanged words after James blocked a shot by Curry. James eventually pushed Curry out of the way, rankling Klay Thompson, who exchanged some words with James afterward.  Thompson said the root of this disdain for Curry came from his leapfrogging so many players so quickly in the NBA's elite and receiving adoration for it.  McIntyre brought up an incident in which Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook laughed when they were asked about Curry's defense in 2016. Thompson said it was another example of the chasm between Curry and some of the NBA's stars:  ""I think if you ask them and they were being honest, they don't like all the hype he gets, and they have to direct it that way. I think out of all of them, if somebody doesn't like Steph Curry, I think it's probably Westbrook. He just shows no sign of - this really ain't about Steph. It's bigger. His seems to be, 'I don't like that dude.' ""But LeBron and them, I think they will say: 'Man, I like Steph. We can have a conversation.' But there's something that burns them about the fact that Steph is the one that is exalted, and because of that, they want to go at him and, in fact, kind of demean his hype. They want to take him down."""
Russell Westbrook is just Kyrie Irving with triple doubles
"If you could only pick either Kyrie Irving or Russell Westbrook on your team as the point guard, which one would be more tolerable?"
Why the fuck would the Lakers trade LeBron for a deteriorating Russell Westbrook...
Pretty sure if they traded Ben Simmons in a straight up deal for Russell Westbrook (not that either team would do that) Ben he’d average 25 points and maybe a triple double and would be second team all NBA
Russell Westbrook is just Ben Simmons that's willing to shoot a jump shot*
Russell Westbrook is just Ben Simmons with a jump shot
"Kyrie seems irrationally thin skinned. Not just the fact he's thin skinned but then he lashes out at anyone who asks legit questions. He's like a more woke, detailed Russell Westbrook."

Who shoots better? One arm curry or Russell Westbrook
"You don’t have to be a good rebounder to get uncontested rebounds. You realize this, correct?  Russell Westbrook is statistically the worst 20 ppg scorer ever. Refute that"
&gt; ever   Confirmed doesn’t watch basketball   &gt; doesn’t matter   Yes it does. And guess what genius the reason other teams don’t do this is because   **Russell Westbrook is a better rebounder than the average point guard**  Come on now dude you’re literally setting yourself up to be proven wrong at this point
"[Here is a basketball-reference comparison for 2018-19](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=russell+westbrook&amp;player_id1_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=westbru01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=kyrie+Irving&amp;player_id2_select=Kyrie+Irving&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=irvinky01&amp;idx=players)  Comparing their regular season advanced stats, Kyrie was better but Russ had his strengths.  Kyrie had significantly higher PER, TS%, and WS/48.  Russ had the edge on VORP, ast%, reb%, and in defensive stats.    The playoffs were a small sample size, but Russ did have a better playoff.    Personally, I'd rather have Westbrook if I were trying to have the best team possible next year between the two.  While Westbrook is older, he's far healthier.  They're both nutty, but Westbrook at least shows some signs of self-awareness.  I think Westbrook needs a strong coach that can reign in his bad tendencies, but I'm not sure anything can save Kyrie from himself."
"Franchise changing not defining.  2018:Deandre Ayton (potential), Luka, and Bagley all look like future all stars. Hell Traye Young was 5th and I'd count him.  2015: Towns  2014: Embiid  2012: Anthony Davis  2011: Kyrie (championship)  2010: John Wall  2009: Blake Griffin, James Harden  2008: Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook (at 4th)  2007: Kevin Durant, Al Horford  2006: Aldridge  2005: Chris Paul (at 4th)  2004: Dwight Howard  2003: LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Wade (at 5th)  2002: Yao  2001: Kwame Brown (oh hell yeah)  1999: Elton Brand, Steve Francis, Baron Davis  1997: Tim Duncan, Chauncey Billups  All of those guys were either the face of the franchise, changes the direction of the franchise, or were the best player for their respective teams"
"I don't expect most of /r/nba watches the Celtics religiously.  What most Boston fans aren't going to tell you is that almost all our on-court scuffles this season involved Jaylen Brown.  On multiple occasions, he took plays off or hung his head after blowing a defensive assignment and either Marcus Smart or Marcus Morris ripped into him.  There were also rumblings behind the scenes that Brown and Rozier were both pretty pissed off about their limited bench roles and were bitching/sulking.  Hayward himself admitted in a Jackie mac article that while it was never personal, he could feel the frustration/tension from players (like Brown) unhappy their roles had diminished with his return.  Brown could have a bright future, but this season was a learning lesson.  They bought into their own myth and genuinely believed they were world-beaters.  In reality, this team wasn't nearly as talented as they believed themselves to be.  Players like Rozier publicly admitted that he saw his own teammates as his competition when he was on the court and as recently as yesterday whined about how much he had to sacrifice this season.   Jaylen was flat out dog shit for the first couple months of the season.  Eventually, he got in a grove.  He played really well over the second half of the season.  That carried into a decent playoff performance.  There's a decent chance we trade him this Summer, but I'm sure he and the rest of these guys will look back on this season as a huge educational experience - and a humbling one.    Of course, most fans just are making Kyrie Irving the scapegoat, but the problems with the Celtics were much deeper.  At the end of the day, Kyrie Irving is a Top 25 player, Al Horford is a fringe star, and arguably the third best player on the team was Marcus Morris - a career role player.  Winning 49 games and losing in the 2nd round makes total sense given the talent level of this squad.  Unfortunately, fans just keep hyper-focusing on the fact Boston improbably made the ECF last season instead of recognizing that it was a remarkable act of overachieving. On a talent level, this team is on a par with the Thunder.  Paul George took that team to 49 wins and a 1st round exit despite having Russell Westbrook as a sidekick.  Boston having similar results with their dysfunctional roster makes sense.  But I guess it's easier to just blame Kyrie for the Celtics not being the Golden State Warriors East."
"If the Heat are going to find an heir apparent to Miami Heat reserve forward Chris Bosh, their pick of players is almost certainly center Hassan Whiteside, who is now a restricted free agent.   However, a recent report suggests that teams are concerned about a potential offer sheet from Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook and are now seeking to see whether this offer is for a max contract, such as the max contract offered to the Chicago Bulls right wing Rajon Rondo last offseason, or a second contract.   According to ESPN's Chris Forsberg, the Timberwolves are seeking to bring in a second player in exchange for the Heat's first-round pick.   That trade involves the Timberwolves getting back Kevin Love (who signed a $12 million offer sheet with Brooklyn) to clear some salary cap space and potentially give the Heat something more substantial to work with in the second half of the deal."
Russell Westbrook was robbed
"Is Russell Westbrook Good? Is Russell Westbrook good for it, and does he think the Oklahoma City Thunder could make a serious run at that would be worthy of LeBron James, Paul George or Steve Nash?  In a world dominated by a singular LeBron James, Westbrook needs to be able hit the ball around and score at a higher rate. When that doesn't happen, Oklahoma City will need Westbrook.  To put it another way, the Thunder's shooting and floor spacing problems (their defensive issues and lack of depth) could all be solved if Russell Westbrook could just get some ball control and open shots in a more efficient offense.  And that's why James and George are the only guys who can fill in the gap in the middle of those guards. They're all very smart passers and shooters with an eye for the big moments, and their skillset is not restricted to two-man offense.  These three could be the top shooting trio in the NBA"
Haha my dude did you think that could've been Russell Westbrook? Talk about an outlier.
"I'm not saying he's trash, just that he's not a Russell Westbrook level player, he can still be an all star eventually I believe"
*of Russell Westbrook
"Right that's why I said it has an effect but for him to go full Russell Westbrook is more than just an injury. He went from 70 TS% vs the Clips, 63 TS% Game 1 to 49 TS% Games 2-4. It looked to be more than just a injury thing, something was up mentally...though it could have to do with the injury as well."
I think that still goes to Russell Westbrook lol
"&gt; Sound like a lot? It *is* a lot. To study it further is to discover that it's less of an anomaly than a matter of course: A possession-by-possession video analysis of Embiid's season reveals that he has fallen 244 times since the start of the 2018-19 campaign, which comes out to 3.3 times per game or roughly one fall for every 10 minutes the Sixers center spends on the court.   &gt;   &gt;How does that falling down stack up? Although no falls-per-36-minutes metric exists on a league-wide scale, we studied five games of video on five other players known for regularly denting the floor: [Ersan Ilyasova](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2767/ersan-ilyasova), who led the NBA this season in drawing charges; [Blake Griffin](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3989/blake-griffin), second in charges; [Jusuf Nurkic](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102530/jusuf-nurkic), who, like Griffin, gets hit constantly; [Russell Westbrook](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook), perhaps the sport's most aggressive player; and [James Harden](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden), the reigning MVP who drives to the basket -- and, well, flops -- more than anyone.   &gt;   &gt;The takeaway: Embiid indeed belongs on the NBA's Mount Rushmore of Frequent Fallers. He falls more often, on a per-minute basis, than Griffin (every 14 minutes), Nurkic (every 13 minutes) and Westbrook (every 12 minutes) and at roughly the same rate as Ilyasova (every nine minutes) and remains upright a bit more frequently than Harden (every eight minutes). But among true big men -- those with farther to fall and bigger bones to bust -- Embiid stands alone in his inability to remain standing."
But Russell Westbrook needs to be charming and nice to represent the league properly.
"As a Russell Westbrook fan, this feels amazing."
Thoughts on best player in the nba?   Personally:   1) Lebron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Kawhi Leonard  4) James harden 5) Giannis  6) Stephen Curry  7) Joel Embiid 8) Anthony Davies 9) Russell Westbrook  10) nikola Jokic
"Yeah, and Celtic fans don't want him back.  Unfortunately, Celtic fans are under the delusion that they have a team of multiple all-stars that should have gone to the Finals.     The reality is that Boston had 1 top-25 player in Kyrie and a bunch of decent starter-level players.  Horford is a fringe star at the best.  Their 3rd best player this season was arguably Marcus Morris.  Tatum and Brown have potential, but they aren't there yet.  Last season's playoff run was amazing, but unrepeatable.  Everyone acknowledged they dramatically overachieved until somehow that warped into them thinking it was actually a ECF-level squad.  It wasn't.  Last year's team would have lost against this Bucks team too.    So what do you have... a 1-star team with some decent non-stars.  It was good enough for 49 wins and a 2nd round exit.  That puts them on a par with Paul George's Thunder team.  George is arguably better than Kyrie and in spite of having Russell Westbrook as a sidekick, they couldn't even get out of the 1st round.  This is no different.  What Boston did this season makes plenty of sense... but Celtic fans have a totally unreasonable perception of what that group was capable of - so they hold Kyrie to blame for not being singularly as good as the Golden State Warriors and are likely going to drive him out of town as a result.    The team could be much worse next season.  It's a real possibility."
Not even equivalent to one Russell Westbrook
Irrelevant. It will be AD + Jrue for Russell Westbrook
Something the Rockets have going for them is that they’re not relying on Russell Westbrook.
"It's really hard to tell. I think some logical offers would be a Pascal Siakam based package (if Kawhi stays), a Ben Simmons based package, a Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown package.  Could see Klay Thompson + Draymond Green for him too. Russell Westbrook. Anything on Portland not named Damian Lillard.   It's really hard to tell what people would give up for an old Lebron. Surely some teams would do star swaps for him, but some teams would be selling second tier assets to pair Lebron with their current star."
*This comment was sponsored by the Russell Westbrook gang*
Kyrie Irving because Russell Westbrook and Paul George played injured!
"Honestly, this probably isn't even an exaggeration.  As far as in game leaping, I doubt a single player gets as high as PatCon as often as him.  He dunks more per minute than peak Russell Westbrook, he blocks jump shots more than just about anybody not named Mitchell Robinson, he skies for rebounds all the times.    Considering how short he is with short arms, it is crazy how many plays he makes on the ball in the air."
"Haha I know. And yep, he’s he next Russell Westbrook (better version though)."
"Kyrie “Russell Westbrook workout rebounds” Irving, better?"

How'd you end up leaving Russell Westbrook out of the California All Star map?
"That guys dumb, but I think making Kanter unplayable is less about having a really good big and more about having really good guard play to make him move laterally in space, which the nuggets don’t have, but the Celtics do. That being said he did well against Russell Westbrook and PG, but I guess it’s up for debate whether Russ really qualifies for that"
"Curry, Irving, kemba, lilliard, wall, Westbrook are 100% no debate better.   Murray, cp3, Ben Simmons are most likely better.   Rubio, Bledsoe, Russell, fox are at about the same level.   If you count guys like harden as guards, then it opens up a bit more.    Average doesn’t mean exactly half, average is like 12-18"
"I think it's pretty clear that if your team's primary ball handler is a really bad shooter, it's going to be extremely difficult for your team to have success in the playoffs. We know this because we have two examples of players like this with drastically different approaches to their poor shooting, and neither one works. Those players are Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook.   Simmons is a bad shooter, so he never shoots, and this is a problem because teams just ignore him defensively on the perimeter, knowing he won't put up a shot. Westbrook is a bad shooter, but he shoots it any time he's open, and often times when he's not, and this is a problem because teams begin to game plan for that and actually try to bait him into taking as many outside jumpers as possible because they know that's a win for the defense any time he does.  People are always saying Simmons is a coward and needs to shoot it to keep defenses honest, just like they're always saying Westbrook shoots too much and shouldn't let himself get baited into taking 10 3s a game, but I think the truth is that there is no easily solution for either of these players, like just adjusting the number of shots they take. All they can do is improve as shooters or else it's gonna be a problem no matter what."
"Last year Dame was swept from the playoffs and was filled with loathing and faced incredible adversity. He could have rolled over and died but instead he humbly worked on his game. He refined it and molded it into him becoming easily the second best point guard in the league with a solid case for being number one. Russell Westbrook has also faced adversity. Once Kevin Durant stabbed him in the back and the heart simultaneously, he had all of the good will in the world. All he did was squander it by refusing to become a true leader and setting up a culture toxicity. It's no surprise he has such ardent defenders in this day and age since he reflects many of the things that's wrong with this society. The selfishness, the rudeness, the lack of emotional control, the big talk without backing it up (does this sound like someone you know? A certain politician perhaps?) etc.- it's all there. When people see him, they see themselves and revel in his loser mentality because losers love company. Winners that play the right way that actually deserve this kind of over the top reverence, like Tim Duncan, are relegated to afterthoughts. I hope this series helps move the NBA (and maybe, just maybe society) into a better place. In a world of Westbrooks, be a Lillard."
"No doubt some of it is pressure and the defense by the Rockets but I still think his finger is bugging him. Curry is still at 62.3 TS% for the playoffs and was at 63.4 TS% game 1 of the Houston series. His fall off is at game 2 which is when he dislocated his finger in the first quarter, since Game 2 he's been 49.0 TS% which is basically Russell Westbrook. [It still looked swollen yesterday prior to game 1.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D559HWLX4AcgEwW.jpg)."
"That's ludicrous man, you wouldn't take Russell Westbrook over Kyle Lowry?"
"We are all overthinking this. Here is what we need to do:  &amp;#x200B;  Combine the brains of two NBA players to create one guy. We will call this player something like Ben Westbrook. Or Russell Simmons. No, lets go with Ben Westbrook.   We will have a player who plays hard defense without caring about the stats, who will shoot badly, but still shoot enough to keep the defense honest without shooting his team out of the game. Sure, he'll be a little whiny when he gets any criticism, but every player has flaws, right? Combining their mindsets would create a sensational player."
"Definitely worse than Curry, Lillard. Probably worse than Kyrie, Jrue. Arguable with Kemba, CP3. Better than Kemba, Westbrook, Simmons, Russell. Bledsoe's an interesting comp because they fill similar roles but with very different skillsets.   He's probably 4th/5th, for sure in the top-10.  Who knows going forward though, he's old."

What happens when you build a team around Russell Westbrook.
"&gt;the 30 starting level point guards that have possessed the skill since they were 12, not gonna happen.  A lot of the 30 were recruited to division 1 schools because they were athletic freaks and such, not because they were fully developed shooters, and certainly not from NBA range for threes.  Lonzo was 41.2% on over 5 three attempts per game as a college freshman.  I'm probably forgetting people, but Kyrie, Steph and Lillard are the only starting point guards I notice similar for that.  College freshman :  Lonzo Ball = 41.2% threes, 67.3% free throws  Ben Simmons = made 1 three, 67.0% FT  Kemba Walker = 27.1%, 71.5%  De'Aaron Fox = 24.6%, 73.6%  Russell Westbrook = 40.9% (22 attempts), 54.8%  Mike Conley = 30.4%, 69.4%  Kyle Lowry = 22.7%, 63.5%  Eric Bledsoe = 38.3%, 66.7%"
"Mention playoffs, an indicator of team success, when debating individuals. I’ll give you a list of Harden’s all-star teammates over his career: CP3, KD, Russell Westbrook.

I’m a Rockets fan, but you’re talking out of your ass saying Harden is better than AD."
Retarded. Lebron didn't play with all those players at once. By your logic Kevin Durant has played with  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Draymond Green  Demarcus Cousins  Serge Ibaka  Steven Adams

"I think two things are left out here.   1. Kobe knew how to feed his big men. That’s not easy.  Kobe adapted his game to facilitate and get Shaq in the right places. He knew how to move off the ball as well and get shaq his space.  We had no true pg in those threepeats. He didn’t just do that with shaq, he knew how to get the most out of his bigs (pau, Odom, Bynum).  Lebron really isn’t really the best at getting a lot out of his bigs. Love and bosh had severe drop offs with him.   2.  Kobe was a two way player in all of those championships. Most importantly he could cover elite pg’s when our other guys were getting burned. This is huge. In all of our championships Kobe had to step up for fisher and was essential in slowing down elite point guards (Parker, Bibby, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Rondo, Jason Kidd, deron Williams etc) he lost a step and coasted at times in those last two rings, but come playoff time he buckled down and was huge in a way guys like curry, harden, and Westbrook Could not be relied upon."

"What team wouldn't be ok with that?

"This dude needs to search ""Russell Westbrook"" on r/NBA sometime"
"I mean, KD did this for an even longer time with probably the most ball-dominant and lowest basketball IQ star guard in the NBA In Russell Westbrook.  And no, LeBron can’t touch Durant’s efficiency."
Wearing those goggles to a press conference is something Russell Westbrook or Cam Newton would do on a random day in December
"He also said Paul Pierce, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis rank ahead of Curry all time after they lost game 4."

"Gimme a fucking break. You know who's not a winner either then? Anthony Davis, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Giannis. Hell, I'll go even further back! Karl Malone, John Stockton, Charles Barkley!  If you've paid any attention at all, Melo has tried to improve on defense. His age and his legs won't let him. He's old, oh well. He's not very good anymore. He has said many times that he's willing to change. He did on OKC and Houston. It didn't work out, he's simply not good anymore. But to derail his entire career and make a comparison like that, there is clearly no sensible way of having this discussion with you. Good night, enjoy your championship."
"Jeremy Lin has more rings than Charles Barkley, James Harden, Christ Paul, Melo, Paul George, and Russell Westbrook."
He also LOVES Stephen A Smith and HATES Russell Westbrook.
Serge Ibaka is an NBA Champion before Russell Westbrook or James Harden
"Or Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, PG, Dwight Howard, Jimmy Butler, or LMA."
Ibaka has more rings than Russell Westbrook and James Harden combined
"Just like we all predicted, Serge Ibaka won a ring before Russell Westbrook and James Harden."
JEREMY LIN AND SERGE IBAKA WON RINGS BEFORE RUSSELL WESTBROOK
IBAKA WILL HAVE A RING BEFORE RUSSELL WESTBROOK AND JAMES HARDEN
Russell Westbrook has a bigger wingspan than him lol
Russell Westbrook career:  43.4% FG - 30.8% 3FG - 46.5% eFG  Kawhi Leonard last 14 games:  43.5% FG - 31.4% 3FG - 48.0% eFG  Raptors need Kawhi to do more than just draw fouls if they're gonna win.
"No, and that's a completely different context. There's a sense of ownership over players in the NBA (and the other leagues in the US, and around the world), where they belong to the fans of the team they play for. It's not some wacky new idea I've come up with either, it's a known phenomenon. Think about the GSW part owner pushing Kyle Lowry the other day. Or the Utah Jazz fan yelling racial slurs at Russell Westbrook. Neither of those things would happen on the street if those men were walking past a normal unfamous black man, but when it's in the arena, they feel an entitlement to attack the players, or even to touch them."
Those guys are the rightful winners of the award. Joking would have to truly seperate himself as the single most valuable player to win it. Because his game doesn’t pop off the screen at you unless you’re a coach or player yourself or a fan of real X’s and O’s basketball. Which people say they are. But then tell you their favourite player is Russell Westbrook or James Harden lol

"For a second there I thought you were talking about Russell Westbrook, [GQ’s Most Stylish Man Alive ‘15.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gq.com/gallery/russell-westbrook-style-photos/amp)"
"I mean defense *is* half the game lol, so that's enough to end the argument right there. But even just offense, we must've been watching a different prime Rose I guess. The one I saw was basically Russell Westbrook*, a top 5ish player in the league. So, *extraordinarily* good. But KD is still on another level, like top-10 all-time type of level.  *Seriously, compare Westbrook's &amp; Rose's numbers in Rose's MVP year."
"What is that good about Lakers youth?   If not for all the hype and marketing machine, Lonzo would be deemed bust long time time ago, a 2nd pick that can't dribble, shoot, layup, hit free throws is somewhat good?   Brandon Ingram and Kuzma are Tim Hardaway jr. in forwards body. Both are pretty much useless in everything aside from inefficient chucking.   I understand that Ntilikina is a bust. Knox didn't look good, but he's still 19 for crying out loud.   Mitchel Robinson is easily more valuable than anything Lakers have in their ""young core"" and Trier is better, dare I say by I significant margin than Josh Hart. If Dennis Smith was on Lakers he would be considered a second coming of Russell Westbrook."

"Again if you are getting Dragen Bender or Kris Dunn with the pick is that improving your team?  Lottery picks for the sake of lottery picks isn't going to make you better.  Going back over the last ten years here's what the 4th pick gets you (setting Jaren Jackson aside as we don't know, and I'll set Josh Jackson aside as well, so three years in the league with the 4th pick  Dragen Bender, Kristaps, Aaron Gordon, Cody Zeller, Dion Waiters, Tristen Thompson, Wesley Johnson, Tyreke Evans, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley  So in a ten year window there's three great players and a decent one and two that are okay. But you are more likely to wind up with a nobody than you would landing Russell Westbrook.  Even the process failed 60% of the time getting only Embiid and Simmons out of it."
Russell Westbrook
"I Intensely dislike Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and Dwyane Wade."
"Lonzo’s best games are very few and far between relative to the entire season. Your stats mention the greatest games he’s ever had, not the average Lonzo Ball good game. You mention on his worst nights he’s the best perimeter defender on the floor.... on his worst nights his man outscores his by 20+ on better efficiency. Being a great defender only means so much, when you are a dead dog on offense.   If Lonzo retired today, it would have a an incredibly small bearing on their organizations future. That isn’t “great” status.   Players I have as great this past season: Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Blake Griffin, etc....  Lonzo has absolutely nothing in common with those guys on the basketball court. Great players have huge bearings on their teams success. Their absents usually mean that their team has to re evaluate their coaching, and are players that teams absolutely have to gameplan for.   Players that I have listed as “good”: De’Aaron Fox, Devin Booker, Victor Oladipo, D’Angelo Russell, Donovan Mitchell.   These players show up every game. This list usually can’t carry a team by themselves, but they have to be accounted for EVERY night. Because they show up in every game. Lonzo isn’t a player that teams have to stress about on a nightly basis. He’s a player that will surprise you, and have some really good games every here and there. Then he’ll have games where he’s just there. That’s why he’s an average basketball player. On his “good” nights he’s not up there with those players I listed as “good”.   The only reason why he’s average and not below average is because he has playmaking and defensive skills that are valuable, and hard to find in today’s league."
Russell Westbrook
"Eh, I think D'Lo's style is super slick and very stylish. While Westbrook was also pretty stylish, i do think his ostentatious look lent itself to appearing a little clown-like in a lot of his dress.  I mean, even the new MIB commercials poke fun at this depicting Russell as an Alien who wears crazy outfits."
Russell Westbrook in shambles
Russell Westbrook for Anthony Davis?
"This is why in my opinion they should play less games.  Look at all the stars getting injured:  - Paul George - Derrick Rose - kd - Russell Westbrook  And the list go on and on. Without counting those who could have been stars but couldn't because they got injured before their prime.  Basketball is by far one of the most physically challenging games:  You have the fastest athletes, jumping, dribbling, falling, dunking and running back and forth all day.  They have a shot clock so they literally have to run the whole court back and forth dozens of times a game.  If you reduced the number of games per season from 82 to say, 41:   - The probability of freak injuries like the one  Paul George suffered goes down.  - Stress injuries like the one KD got goes down.  The sport changed a lot since hand checking was banned in 2004.  I hate seeing superstars go like this."
"“One of the biggest reasons I’m told that Kevin Durant may have the Lakers at the top of his list is because the Lakers have been led to believe, by whom specifically I do not know, but the Lakers have been led to believe that it is a very good chance that the following year Russell Westbrook is coming.”  He hedges his bet 5 times in 1 tweet."
Dang I thought this was going to be Russell Westbrook.
"&gt;Yes there have been super teams before, but not a top 5 player joining an established championship team.  Yeah, but this distinction between the two isn't like from one universe to another.  The Warriors did it far more ""correct"" than any other super team, they drafted their core, simply were fortunate with cap space because of extensions and an injury to Curry and *added* Durant  The Heat went from giving Michael Beasley and Quentin Richardson major minutes to adding the best player on the planet and a top 10-15 player in Chris Bosh.   Durant is obviously to blame for choosing his destination, but it's not like we had ever seen the best player in the league leave his team to go join up with another top 5 player, from his draft class that was already an NBA champion, and add another top 10-15 player alongside him, all in or entering their prime.  Because of Durant people forget or at least ignore the **round the clock** coverage on how much LeBron James was a coward and a non-competitor for The Heatles. He didn't care about his legacy, he didn't care about beating the competition, every other day was a different Hall of Famer chiming in about how they wouldn't do what LeBron did.  I don't excuse what Durant did, I think if he wanted to just go have an easier team to play with he should've just picked anywhere that didn't start Russell Westbrook, but I do think that LeBron gets a lot of revisionist history these days because he played the most non-LeBron series of his career in the 2011 Finals and was relying on a hobbled Wade by the end of the Heatles run.   LeBron very clearly wanted to slap the shit out of the league with The Heat, and if not for one bad series and Wade's knees falling apart, he probably would have."
Yeah but I’d rather the guy who helps me win then the Russell Westbrook flash

"/u/818GOAT responded to this with   &gt;Well said. The guy just can't show up when it matters most. His stans will brush it off and talk about TS% (free throws)  And I typed this out before he deleted that comment, but it's relevant here too:   Few things:  1) eFG% removes FTs from the equation. We can look at that and find he has a 51.35 eFG%. That's not superb, but better than guys like Kemba, Russell, Conley, Doncic, Nurkic, Markannen, Gasol, Butler, etc. had this regular season.   2) Curry is 16th all time in playoff eFG%, which doesn't sound spectacular without context. Everyone ahead of him is a 6'9""+ PF/C except Bernard King (HOF, only 28 playoff games) and J-Rich (37 playoff games). Curry is highest among all guards except Richardson, and has played in 111 playoff games.  3) Curry is averaging 10.2 FTA/G this series, which sounds like a lot and in many ways is. Kawhi is averaging 11.2 FTA/G.  4) Career in the playoffs, Curry averages 5.3 FTA/G. Among all players with 25 playoff games or more, that ranks tied for 102nd all time. Players who take at least 1 more FTA/G than Curry across their playoff careers include Damien Lillard, John Wall, Dwyane Wade, DeMar DeRozan, Kobe, Cousy, Westbrook, IT, West, Gervin, Kevin Johnson, AI, Moncrief, and Ben Gordon. Curry is not near to the most reliant on FTs in playoff games, even controlling across era or position.  5) Curry's 3 pointer, paired with Thompson's 3 pointer, just stole a win-or-go-home game in Toronto after losing their best player and their only consistent big.  Y'all just look salty when you try to make this about ""Curry stans"" instead of just enjyoing one of the all time greats, the way I'm enjoying the hell outta watching Kawhi dominate offensively"
Never paid attention to combine data ever since I saw Doug McDermott had a higher vertical than Russell Westbrook

"Jalen Rose sure has a lot of hot takes about Durant.

""And now that he's living it, it's almost like, 'Wait a minute, they not treating me like I'm No. 1.' I'm seeing him sparring a little bit with Steve Kerr and the media. I'm seeing him going back and forth with Draymond in the huddle. I'm seeing the team play better when he's not in the lineup but Steph is. The team really struggles when he's in the lineup and Steph isn't. In particular, against the Dallas Mavs.""  Jalen Rose in May 2019, explaining how this is Durant's team and Curry needs to learn how to adjust to that: [Jalen Rose Thinks Kevin Durant Is to Blame for Steph Curry's Slump](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/csn/warriors/Why_Jalen_Rose_thinks_Kevin_Durant_is_to_blame_for_Steph_Curry_s_slump_BAY-509652252.html)  &gt; ""I got a theory of what's contributing to Steph's struggles,"" Rose said. ""This has become Kevin Durant's team and he's got to adjust. Physically and mentally. When KD first joined the squad, last time I checked, (Curry) had just won the MVP. The only unanimous one in the history of the game. And everybody, including myself, was upset that KD had the nerve to join the team that knocked him out of the playoffs after they were up 3-1. At that time, it was Steph's squad. Since then, they've won two championships. Who's the Finals MVP? Who's the person each night when we go into games saying, 'Ain't nothing we can do about that? He's the most unstoppable offensive force in the game.' &gt;  &gt; ""This year, in my opinion, it's officially become Kevin Durant's team."" Rose continued. ""And I'm not talking about what the fans perceive. I'm talking about, when we're in the huddle and it's about to be a game-winning play, they giving the ball to who? Exactly.""   And there's always this classic: [Jalen Rose predicts Kevin Durant will leave for the Houston Rockets in 2016](https://oklahoman.com/article/3896683/espns-jalen-rose-predicts-kevin-durant-will-leave-for-the-houston-rockets-in-2016?)  &gt; On ESPN’s Grantland YouTube channel, former NBA player Jalen Rose has gone on record predicting Kevin Durant will leave the Thunder to go to Houston as a free agent in the summer of 2016. &gt;  &gt; “I think, after he plays out the couple years on his contract, that he goes to Houston to play with Dwight Howard and James Harden,” Rose told ESPN’s Bill Simmons, after giving his reasoning (watch the above video). &gt;  &gt; Following that, Rose proceeded to lay out the second part of his nightmare scenario for OKC fans, saying Russell Westbrook would then leave the Thunder for Los Angeles. &gt;  &gt; “He’s going to leave OKC and go with Kevin Love to the Los Angeles Lakers,” Rose said."
Why the hell would he want to go back to playing with the black hole Russell Westbrook?  Nothing good will come from that.

"I learned to never doubt KD. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah. Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?"" But when I looked up there was no one there.   Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember."" But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder.   Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important. The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.   My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named cocaineandmojitos710 started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.   Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.   People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."

Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy.""  My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named cocaineandmojitos710 started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"Right, but it just seems weird to say Quinn Cook, a borderline NBA player, is Russell Westbrook at his worst lol. There's plenty of chuckers in the NBA who aren't MVP caliber players that could've been used as an example."
"I'm curious what ""Allstar"" they could possibly be targeting. Going off of this year's list...  **Contract Over:** Kemba, Kyrie, Kawhi, Klay, Middleton, Vucevic, Russell  **Untouchable/won't be traded:** Giannis, Embiid, Curry, Harden, Lebron, PG13, Westbrook, Lillard, Jokic, Oladipo (injured)  **Old/Retired/Shouldn't be Allstars:** Dirk, Wade,  **That leaves:** Beal, Simmons, Griffin, Aldridge, KAT  &amp;#x200B;  Beal is the only one that makes sense. I don't see KAT getting traded. Griffin doesn't make sense for Detroit to move. Aldridge is old and San Antonio doesn't quite have a package for him.  &amp;#x200B;  Other non-2019 Allstars maybe to consider: Love, Horford, Hayward, Wall, Millsap, Draymond Green, McCollum, DeRozan, Conley, Gasol."

"Steph Curry to save the world  Monstars:  Russell Westbrook (guarantees one of the Monstars hurts the team going for a triple double)  James Harden (Need a perimeter defender that team Looney Toons can exploit)  Paul George (Teammates with Russ, Monstars can get 3 players from one game if it's OKC vs Houston)  Draymond Green (gotta make it personal for Steph, plus he will rip the Westbrook and Harden Monstars for not playing winning basketball)  Klay Thompson (again, gotta make it personal to motivate Steph, plus it would be funny to just have a chill Monstar)"
"https://www.nba.com/article/2019/03/15/reports-utah-jazz-lifetime-ban-second-fan  &gt;The Utah Jazz have reportedly banned another fan for life from Vivint Smart Home Arena.  The ban comes three days after issuing their first such ban to a fan for similar actions. According to the The Deseret News' Eric Woodyard and The Salt Lake Tribune's Eric Walden and Andy Larsen, the fan being banned is one who used a derogatory term in talking to Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook during the 2018 playoffs. The video in question is one from the 2018 playoffs, in which the fan -- who has not been identified by either newspaper or the team -- called Westbrook ""boy"" before Game 4 of last year's first-round series. In the video, Westbrook says ""don't call me boy,"" and warned the fan before the fan said it again. Westbrook then flagged down security to handle the matter."
"Not OP, but here's a fan who was banned for life for heckling  https://deadspin.com/the-chud-who-heckled-russell-westbrook-has-been-permane-1833244144"
"A guy yelled racial slurs at Russell Westbrook literally this season and is banned for life from Utah. An owner physically put his hands on a player and treated him like property more than a person. Albeit not the same crime, but 100% agree with your statement. If a regular fan did that shit, they’d be out with a letter from Adam silver already written by days end. Owner should be held to the same level of accountability to prevent regulars fans from thinking they can do the same."
"Rodney Hood slapped a fan's phone out of his hand last year, got a 35k fine and no suspension.    Russell Westbrook shoved a fan who was celebrating on the court after a buzzer beater last year, no fine and no suspension."
"Should be Kawhi. Here's how I see it:   The Monstars have been nursing their wounds in a distant galaxy, keeping close tabs on the evolution of the NBA since their defeat. MJ is no longer a factor. LeBron has missed the playoffs for the first time in a decade, perhaps signaling the slightest decline in his powers. And now, for the first time ever, the Monstars can sap all the individual ballin' power they need from *a single team.* You know which one. The time is ripe to attack.   The Monstars attend a Curry family charity game and absorb Steph's powers but don't know who Seth is so they leave him alone. They spot Klay out on a boat w/ Dan Bilzerian and 20 thots and get him. One of the more tech savvy Monstars tweets disparaging comments at KD about his lack of testicular fortitude and lists a location where they can meet up and settle this beef. KD is snatched. Boogie and Dray are found at a post season league meeting discussing the sensitivity of referees. Snatched.   The Monstars now have all they need to dominate the world via basketball prowess once again. Who will stop them? Not MJ. Not LeBron. Definitely not Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook or AD. Bums. It's over. It's done. The world is theirs..   Cue Kawhi laugh.mp3"
"You little twerps today sure show your sex deprivation and frustration with the world on these forums when you could simply make an argument.  &gt; I think LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul and maybe Kawhi Leonard would have been able to play at close to their same levels today in the 1990s.  Did you miss that, or is your goal just to get peanut gallery upvotes?"
"Not to knock today’s NBA. It just a pretty obvious observation. NBA 2019 is basically video game basketball, an entirely different sport almost. But you see the difference with grown-man basketball before all the rule changes started in 1997-ish in this series. Players even as great as Michael Jordan knew in the 1990s when they went to Madison Square Garden, it was going to be a battle of attrition and you were going to get bloody. The Jazz and Pistons were very physical too, while Gary Payton made the Seattle Supersonics a physical team.  &amp;#x200B;  I personally don’t like how point guards today dribble all the way up the court untouched and just shoot 3s. You had to shake hard hand-checks and get through several screens before even crossing the timeline in the 1990s. I think LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul and maybe Kawhi Leonard would have been able to play at close to their same levels today in the 1990s. But nobody else really would.  &amp;#x200B;  Defense and genuine HATE rivalries no longer exist in the NBA which makes it far less exciting. So while we’re waiting for Game 5 tomorrow, let’s watch how basketball from 1900-1999 used to be before all the turn of the millennium rule changes."

"I don’t think that makes us a finals contender. I think both the Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook contracts are extremely corrosive and I don’t want to be anywhere near them. I also think Jimmy’s contract is going to look just as bad in a few years.   We might make it to the ECF but even then I’d say Philly and Milwaukee are better than us.   Also, Justise is more of a power forward than he is a small forward or point guard."

Can we get a better definition on dominance, to try and help create a better argument to change your mind?"
"Players not even allowed to talk about themselves!  ""How do you rate your performance tonight, Russell?""  Westbrook: NEXT QUESTION"
"Rockets are toast. Russell Westbrook is a role player. Love the guy, but I have a new definition for ‘role-player’ with the modern game:   If you can’t shoot the 3 or can only shoot the 3, you’re a role player not an all star.   Same goes for guys like Redick. Le Bron don’t count - he’s older generation."

They had to give up a ton of picks because they were getting Russell fucking Westbrook in return not expirings. You don’t need to add picks to Chris Paul to trade him for expirings
"Considering the interviewer's job is to generate stories, I'd say they did a heck of a job.  They got a non-canned response, which is good, but at the same-time you got that OKC report and Russell ""next question"" Westbrook.  However, I would never know about that reporter if it wasn't for ""next question"" Westbrook."
Hot seat  I’m sorry but if you’ve got Paul George and Russell Westbrook and get bounced convincingly in the first round two years in a row it’s time to look at coaching
Russell Westbrook has left the chat
russell westbrook is an athletic human
"That's just Russell Westbrook. He always takes shots and plays like he's on fire, so when he actually is then he's a force of nature and is incredibly tough to stop. But when he's not then he ends up shooting his team out of the game by going something like 10-30, or shooting 19 three pointers like he did in Game 6."
Well obviously those are just rough estimates but if Russell Westbrook can average a 30 point triple double then Im confident LeBron can average better numbers considering he is a significantly better player in all facets so I based it off that. I cant fucking predict his exact statline to the tee jeez.
"paul george is an mvp candidate &amp; russell westbrook won one  mitchell is in a hellhole of a conference and ran into the rockets twice.. so what the hell do you think pj tucker/trevor ariza would do to ben simmons  donovan would kill miami &amp; brooklyn too, &amp; wouldn’t put 1 point up in a playoff game *ever.*  fact is donovan/embiid is lightyears better than ben/gobert."
"""I've been told Russell Westbrook has been working hard and put on 20 lbs of pure shooting skills."""
&gt; “Russell Westbrook is going to be more of a shooter come next season”  - I sleep  &gt; “Ben Simmons is going to be more of a shooter come next season”  - *Real shit?!?!*
"James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Dwyane were all star guards in 2013 though. All played more games than Kobe."
"According to stats.nba.com, between 2013-14 and 2018-19, Russell Westbrook shot about 32.5% (211-of-650) on catch-and-shoot three-pointers, and exactly 30.0% on pull-up three-pointers (429-of-1430)"
"The question is very unspecific. Do you mean each of their respective primes, their rookie campaigns, their first all-star nods, current time, or careers in general? Long post ahead.  &amp;#x200B;  **Respective Primes:** There is no way to assess this because KAT hasn't even hit his prime yet.  *Winner: n/a*  &amp;#x200B;  **Rookie Campaigns:** KAT wins on the account that the offense is pretty much ran through him and Wiggins as opposed to Westbrook having to come off the bench for at least the first 15 games, and that's playing alongside KD. You have a center playing around the basket vs a guard who is coming off the bench for a few games until sometime later that season. Furthermore, KAT is a more efficient scorer here than Westbrook, mainly because of shot selection.  *Winner: Karl Anthony Towns*  &amp;#x200B;  **First All-Star Nods:** Here's where the comparison gets interesting. Both get their nods in the third season of their respective careers. But that's where the paths start to diverge. Westbrook is, of course, a volume scorer who makes his living in the midrange, one of the most difficult shots in the game. KAT's selection is more based around the rim, which gives him a better shot percentage. Westbrook is not a good 3pt shooter while KAT is and takes them more frequently. You'd think that it starts to lean towards KAT, but then you'd have to take into consideration the win shares each players add to a specific team. Westbrook starts to shine brightly here, with some help from KD of course. But because of the dynamic duo's performance, they manage to reach as far as their first conference finals. KAT would only see the first round once with the tandem of Butler, Wiggins, and himself.  *Winner: Russell Westbrook*  &amp;#x200B;  **Current time:** There's not a single question asking who'd owners would build around as the age gap clearly favors KAT. Westbrook's prime is dwindling and we may never see another triple-double season out of him again. KAT has potential, but his current team has disallowed him the advantage to compete. No question you'd build around KAT, Westbrook has proven himself but time is walking right beside him.  *Winner: Karl Anthony Towns*  &amp;#x200B;  **Careers in general:** Is there really an explanation needed for why I should try to defend Westbrook over KAT? Even in his solo seasons, Westbrook has either made the playoffs or barely sat out. And it goes back to each team allowing an environment of competition to be maintained. The most Westbrook has seen on his own is the first round (with bad coaching and injuries in mind). The most KAT has seen on his own is the first round (with bad roster-building and team chemistry in mind).   But Westbrook had the opportunity to play in an NBA Finals, 4 conference finals, 4 second round appearances (subtracted the year he was injured in the first round), and 9 first round appearances. 2x scoring champion, several All-NBA nods, and even that one thing that you don't want to mention but have no other choice but to because it applies like everything else, the League Regular Season MVP.   Sadly, KAT has only seen so much of the NBA playoffs, five games to be precise. And his win shares even surpassed Westbrook's MVP season the year after, but his win shares didn't add up to a more favorable record in many of the years being in Minnesota. You can blame it on the West being a bloodbath, but even Westbrook had stood his ground in many a game against conference opponents.  *Winner: Russell Westbrook*"
I legit don’t know enough about him to dispute it but I hope you’re wrong :(. Everybody in okc acts like he’s the next big thing but I just hope fans here aren’t expecting another Russell Westbrook or Kevin Durant to just pop right up again
"He’s got Russell Westbrook on his team, harden is not going to get all the blame cause if they underperform it’s likely it’s gonna be due to westbrook."
"I know it’s a controversial fact in these waters, but both Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook have brains. I think it’s important that has been said."
Youre right. I'm an idiot because I don't think you could beat Russell fucking Westbrook In a fight .

Danny Green is horrendous? He makes half of the backcourt.  Warriors? lol   Rockets? Russell Westbrick is guarding Russell Westbrook.  Clippers? They have no passing or length.
"He made almost double the next highest player. With Russell Westbrook and the next several players making scheduled to make $35-39M this year, it'd be like Steph Curry making $70+M."

"I used to absolutely hate Russell Westbrook. All his scowls, antics and screaming rubbed me the wrong way. Plus the fact that he used to go off against my favorite team didn't help.  But after reading a few interviews and especially after KD left, I saw that he was just an incredibly loyal guy who played with a ton of passion and heart and became a huge fan and lowkey Russ apologist. He still makes a lot of boneheaded plays on both ends but here's hoping he gets even better with the Rockets"
Russell Westbrook. Loved him till his MVP season but the man's low IQ basketball decisions in important situations and childish treatment of the media has gotten annoying
"https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  &gt; Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison. That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto.   &gt; After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years."
Happens more often than you think. It's most common with out of bound plays. I remember Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook doing this. Klay Thompson did an unintentional pass to DeMarcus Cousin this year. Bounced off his head and Klay got it back and sunk a midranger.
I’m not wasting my time debating OMARI FUCKING SPELLMAN vs. RUSSELL WESTBROOK
"&gt;KD not only got drafted by a terrific organization that subsequently drafted Russell Westbrook and James Harden but also Serge Ibaka, and some nice bench players. Granted, the situation wasn’t perfect and the basketball fit wasn’t great,   I disagree. I think the situation was perfect for KD and the basketball fit was great.  They were a young and up coming team that had to take its lumps and match on. I think injuries and the Harden trade was what messed that team up."
Really good job. btw I think you made Russell Westbrook a bit too dark
100% of teams who have won a championship have done so without Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook  Thabo Sefelosha  Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Kendrick Perkins    Jesus I’m old :/
"Are we to assume that his athleticism would scale too? As in, LeBron is insanely athletic and explosive for his size. He would basically be Russell Westbrook with a better shot, significantly better floor vision, and a better basketball IQ."
Bill Russell Westbrook
"But the best part is that after all that, he leaves one of the most complete teams in NBA history to join with a PG who passes less than Russell Westbrook and iso scores almost as much as KD himself in Kyrie Irving, KDs ego is on par with antonio brown"
"[The “80 Point Club”](https://i.imgur.com/un5y3wT.png)   &gt;Since 1947, there have been only 31 confirmed cases of players hitting 80+ PRF in a game. Despite having thirty cases, there are only 20 players who have reached the 80 PRF mark. As indicated earlier, the king of PRF is James Harden, who has hit this threshhold 6 times!  &gt;The next frequent player on the list is Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook with three entries. A curious note about Westbrook is that he is the only player to hit 80 PRF in a playoff game. Only one. Ever.  &gt;If you’re keeping track, this means there are only two players remaining with two 80+ PRF games. Those two players are Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James. That’s it.

yeah he took a backseat to one of the best and most efficient players ever. not 31 year old russell westbrook
What? Peak? You obviously haven’t seen the post asking how many points Russell Westbrook would score if he had carrots for fingers.
"&gt;I am done, it's funny you think you know more than what stats show and what someone who watched 100 of his games think too.  You literally just told me that NO player in the league puts pressure on defenses in half-court like Russell Westbrook while you're arguing about FUCKING STEPH CURRY. I think that shit is really funny, stay off the weeeeeeeeeeeeeeed-ah.  &gt;Like I said he isn't as creative as ome but that doesn't mean he has no vision.  I literally never said he has no vision, I just think that Steph's vision on the court is superior to Russ. For like the ninth time in this argument, you're just putting words in my mouth.  &gt;I probably watched more Curry games than u have and he has never wowed me like that with his passing on ball.  That's fine, they don't run a lot of pick and roll, so you're not going to see much passing on-ball from Steph.   &gt;He also turnovers and make just as much sloppy passes while missing easier reads.  Sure, he does have bad turnovers, but I don't even know how you could begin to argue that he misses ""easier"" reads while he's playing in a motion offense compared to Russ who's coach just runs a basic 4 out-1 in offense or 5-out. While you've argued that his ""spacing"" isn't great due to the quality of shooters, it's at least consistent because he's almost always aware of where his safety valves are to kick out to because there's minimal movement, where Kerr always have the Warriors offense in motion. Warriors easily have better court spacing due to the quality of shooters, but it's much easier for Steph to fuck up a read within the motion offense itself than it is for Russ to fuck up a read in a spread out offense."

Yeah man. You know me. Horrified of James Harden and Russell Westbrook in the NBA playoffs.
Ex. Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
"I don't care how good Russell Westbrook is, I don't like the way he plays and his demeanor on the court. Just can't stand him"
What in the Russell Westbrook is going on here.
1: Magic Johnson   2: Oscar Robertson   3: Stephen Curry   4: Jerry West   5: Isiah Thomas   6: Tony Parker   7: Gary Payton   7: John Stockton  8: Jason Kidd   9:Tim Hardaway   10: Russell Westbrook
"What you're measuring is just defense.  So you might as well figure out the best ways to reflect good defense.  Dirty work without being good defense is just Russell Westbrook gambling and doing dumb shit.  Activity for it's own sake is usually detrimental.  You're right, distance/time = speed.  My point is that's not in any way a valuable thing if minutes aren't reflected somehow.  If you're adding minutes separately, maybe that's fine.  Otherwise, you're penalizing people for playing more time.  How is that fair?  A bench player coming in for 5 minutes isn't necessarily doing more dirty work than the guy who played 36, he's just not trusted to do anything ELSE.  That's LESS valuable.  Draymond, Danny Green, their value is built into their ability to play the way they do for 30 minutes.  That is, definitely doing the ""Most"" dirty work.  Which is why not having someone like Drummond, Adams, Gobert on this list makes literally no sense to me."
"Lol if you say so chief.  If you want to count players who turned 26 in 2015, I'll just add Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, and DeMar DeRozan.  4 MVPs in that list, but yeah Bradley Beal and Andre Drummond really invalidate my whole point."
"If it’s exactly 10 years ago from today, then my list is the following:   • Derrick Rose wins MVP in 2010 at the age of 22   • The Golden State Warriors won 73 games and proceeded to not win the title that year   • Lebron James wins a title with the Cleveland Cavaliers during his second stint with the team   • Russell Westbrook and James Harden won MVP’s and are teammates but not in Oklahoma City   • The Nets managed to sign Kevin Durant   • Kevin Durant joins a 73-win Golden State Warriors team after he losses to them in the WCF  • Steph Curry dropped 400 three-pointers in a single season and won unanimous MVP that year   • Lebron James signs with the Los Angeles Lakers and proceeds to miss the playoffs in his first season there   • Andre Igoudala wins a Finals MVP coming off the bench for the Golden State Warriors   • Dirk Nowitzki led the Dallas Mavericks and won a title against a Miami Heat superteam consisting of Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh  • Dwight Howard was traded to the Kobe Bryant-led Los Angeles Lakers in 2012  • Dwight Howard’s career falls off after being traded and proceeds to play for 5 different teams over a span of 7 years   • Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett are both traded to the Brooklyn Nets   • Ray Allen wins a title with Lebron James"
Russell Westbrook or Karl-Anthony Towns
James Harden and Russell Westbrook play on the same team again   The Warriors won three championships in five years   The Toronto Raptors won a championship  Someone averaged a triple double for three consecutive seasons   The Warriors broke the all-time single regular season win record
Because Kawhi is a better offensive and defensive player than Russell Westbrook.
"I would have said we have Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Curry, Griffin, Davis, Lillard, Wall, Kyrie, Boogie, Klay, Jimmy, George, Love, DeRozan, Holiday,  Lopez, and Teague all making All-Star teams and still 26 or under.  Now we have... D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond.  That’s it.  So a drop off from 18 young All-Stars to 3."
"LeBron, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Davis, George, Lillard, Kyrie, Butler, Griffin, Westbrook, McCollum, Beal, Draymond, Booker, Lowry, Russell, Conley, Aldridge, DeRozan, Harris, Holiday, Drummond, Horford.  That’s 24 players, enough for 2 teams.  Give me some names that would fill out a 3rd roster without using any of those players or the World Cup players."
"LeBron, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Davis, George, Lillard, Kyrie, Butler, Griffin, Westbrook, McCollum, Beal, Draymond, Booker, Lowry, Russell, Conley, Aldridge, DeRozan, Harris, Holiday, Drummond, Horford.  That’s 24 players, enough for 2 teams.  Give me some names that would fill out a 3rd roster without using any of those players or the World Cup players."
"Sure, some of them were young, but that team was still packed with really, really good players.   KD had already made the All-NBA First Team and was the leading scorer of the NBA at the time.  Rose won the MVP award the following season.  Kevin Love led the league in rebounds per game and became got awarded as the most improved player during the following season.  Chauncey Billups was selected to the All-NBA Third Team just one year prior to the tournament.  Stephen Curry was the league leader in FT% and already a deadly shooter.  Russell Westbrook made the All-NBA Second Team the following season.  Lamar Odom was a 2-time champion and became the Sixth Man of the Year the following season.  Danny Granger was an All-Star and top 10 scorer in the league at the time.  Andre Iguodala made the All-Defensive Second Team the following season.  Tyson Chandler won the championship and made the All-Defensive Second Team the following season.  Other than those guys it's just Eric Gordon and Rudy Gay left, and both of them were already good players."
"Easily.  Oscar was a better playoff performer, got his triple doubles naturally, very efficient and proficient and was considered the GOAT at some point.  Russell Westbrook is greatly inefficient, stat pads his triple doubles, has high motor but low IQ and somehow performs worse in the playoffs.  It's not a debate."
"Why the hell is this downvoted lmao.  Oscar was very efficient and got his triple doubles in the flow of the game.  Russell Westbrook is greatly inefficient, leaves his man open to steal a rebound, stat pads greatly and somehow performs even worse in the playoffs.  It's not a debate, AT ALL."
A Team:  Lebron James  Steph Curry  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Anthony Davis  **B+ Team:**  Kyrie Irving  Damian Lillard  Klay Thompson  Jimmy Butler  Andre Drummond  Draymond Green  **B Team**  Russell Westbrook  Kemba Walker  Bradley Beal  CJ McCollum  Kevin Love  **B- Team**  Paul Millsap  Eric Gordon  Tobias Harris  **C Team**  Basically the current roster -Kemba
"Oscar had above average efficiency during his time in the league, Westbrook has noticeably below average efficiency. Robertson wasn't much of a defensive stopper himself, but at least he wasn't negative one.   To conclude it, Robertson was respectfully better in his era than Russell is in his."
"Nobody underrates him defensively, he just made an All-D team despite consistently having pretty average defensive numbers throughout his entire career.  If he was on any other team he’d get worse because a) he’d be the primary focus of perimeter defences instead of Curry and b) he can’t create his own shot and most teams don’t have playmakers the level Curry and Draymond to line up shots for him.  And he took 18 shots a game last year. Good for 15th in the league and  more than the likes of Giannis, KD, Blake Griffin and KAT. Russell Westbrook was the only player in the league who didn’t take the most shots on his team but still took more than Klay, almost no second option gets that many looks and certainly no third option comes close."
"Nah he’s right, Russ has some dope fits but he has a lot of wack ones also.   https://ftks732kpvy18zwzc2s17egw-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Russell-Westbrook-isnt-sure-when-hell-return..jpg   Is this culture?"
James Harden/Russell Westbrook erotic fanfiction
The best team the 2016 Cavs faced in route to beat that 70 win team was a DeRozan and Lowry led Raptors.  The best team the 70 win Warriors faced in route to the finals was a Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook led OKC.
&gt;Russell Westbrook **(HOU)**  just seems wrong
Russell Westbrook: “one year they say I’m a ball hog. The next season I lead the league in assists. So I’m like this doesn’t add up. There’s no way someone can lead the league in assists and still be a ball hog so now they say I can’t shoot”
Joe ingles doing his best Russell Westbrook
"I strongly disagree, for example compare him to Russell Westbrook, aside from Westbrook have a much higher career ppg. his shooting is only marginally better, and Kids actually has a higher career 3pt pct. And that's where the comparison ends for Russ. Kidd &gt; Westbrook"
"https://grantland.com/features/russell-the-creator-westbrook-nba-oklahoma-city-thunder-western-conference-kevin-durant-serge-ibaka-kevin-love/  &gt; Westbrook’s favorite jumper is near the elbow — a midrange pull-up that he and his father have called his “cotton shot” since they practiced it endlessly at Jesse Owens Park in Los Angeles throughout Westbrook’s childhood.  &gt; “My dad taught me that,” he says. “It’s called that because of the cotton net at the park I grew up at. ‘All cotton’ is what my dad used to say. ‘All net.’ That cotton shot is all I practiced.”"
"Russell ""Lefty"" Westbrook is one of my favorite players of all time, but man that's rude. On the other hand, I don't think you should be forced to do an interview."
".... The round table is in 2017 and they're saying he's notoriously a difficult person to deal with from the media's perspective. As far as what's ""rude"", I guess it's in the eye of the beholder.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/01/17/russell-westbrook-conducts-another-hostile-postgame-interview-video/  This article is from 2015, and while it references the Berry incident, it alludes to the fact that Russ has not been cooperative with media questions in the past.  Sorry dude, media circles all over the place are pretty much in agreement here. I'll take there word over a random fan trying to hopelessly defend an athlete.   I'm done trying to convince you. It's really not worth any more effort."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0XDjRHzJo  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqjtdDY5G-Q  https://streamable.com/04rd7 (Tbh, I don't know if this is or isn't Barry, the voice sounds kinda similar but unsure)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdQerN8XENA (Not all of the pieces in this video, but a few, and sorry for the redundancies)  https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/10/22/nba-media-roundtable-russell-westbrook-lebron-james-interview-protest (Not a soundbite, but a roundtable of prominent media members talking about him).  My point is this. Westbrook has shown a clear dislike for many media members (obviously some specific ones like Berry) but has also shown himself to be incredibly temperamental and sensitive to their questions at times. Again, this is one of the most widely reported/disseminated observations in media circles, and many people agree: Westbrook is not the most media friendly player, and given that there are so many stories from different accounts, I'll refer you to my very first comment: Where there's enough smoke..."
"Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, LaMarcus Aldridge/DeAndre Jordan."
"Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, James Harden."
Do you really think Russell Westbrook is worse than Kemba Walker?
Thompson was Jordan before Jordan but MJ was born.  Oscar was Russell Westbrook with a jump shot

"That’s why I hate the “Westbrook is much better because he averaged a triple-double in fewer minutes” takes. This guy was the most efficient volume scorer of his era.  He also had 3 seasons barely missing averaging a triple-double, which shows he didn’t care at all about it. One season he was 7 rebounds short.  Say what tryouts want about his era, if you think he’s overrated because he played with milkmen and plumbers, so did Wilt, Russell and Jerry West."
Russell Westbrook. That’s why.
"Here's the list of those 35 players, announced a god awful long time ago in April, 2018:  Harrison Barnes - See Jerry not everyone dropped  Bradley Beal  Devin Booker - You should've played Book!  You had nothing to lose!  Jimmy Butler   Mike Conley  DeMarcus Cousins  Steph Curry  Anthony Davis  Demar DeRozan  Andre Drummond  Kevin Durant  Paul George  Eric Gordon  Draymond Green  Blake Griffin  James Harden  Tobias Harris  Gordon Hayward  Kyrie Irving  LeBron James  DeAndre Jordan  Kawhi Leonard  Damian Lillard  Kevin Love  Kyle Lowry  CJ McCollum  Khris Middleton - that's 2 Jerry!  Victor Oladipo  Chris Paul  Isaiah Thomas - He should've played.... c'mon IT!  Klay Thompson  Myles Turner   Kemba Walker  John Wall  Russell Westbrook   Yes Jerry, I'm sure you won't forget that the biggest names in the game didn't play in FIBA and you will turn them away at the door when the Olympics roll around.  Invite some younger talent in the first place your crusty old bastard and maybe they won't turn away from you."
"This was in *The Misunderstood Genius of Russell Westbrook* too. I love reading about Russ, such a unique personality.

Yea Russell Westbrook got his diploma at UCLA. Many other top tier players eventually go back and finish their diploma. Stop being dramatic
"Russell is strong &amp; athletic enough to at least hold his own against most bigger players when switching on the perimeter--which is what is generally going to happen. And Harden does pretty well too--by using his quickness &amp; savvy to disrupt bigger guys on D.  OP is right. Their guards do pretty good guarding most Bigs. &amp; since they're usually switching pretty much everything, it's not like they have to guard bigger players for long.  Also, I can't believe I just defended Westbrook &amp; Harden and the fucking Rockets! I'm gonna go have a shower now cuz I feel dirty...."
"Love the ferocity on that dunk. Makes me think of a taller, more skilled Russell Westbrook."
It’s not that. I just like basketball. I like something about each team. I like Houston because of James Harden. Now Russell Westbrook is with him. I like way the coach coached the team. I like Portland because they have a great backcourt. Check McCollum and Dame. I just like so many things about every team. So I enjoy watching the games! I don’t even know if that makes sense.
Russell Westbrook will help the Jazz overcome the Rockets
"Stephen Curry James Harden Lebron James Kevin Durant Anthony Davis - Damian Lillard Klay Thompson Kawhi Leonard Paul George Karl Anthony-Towns - Kyrie Irving LaMarcus Aldridge   Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Draymond Green and Demar Derozan would be the first three substitutes if any of the above guys didn’t play. I threw LaMarcus in there because in FIBA the big guys are a little more valuable, even though I don’t think he’s one of the twelve best American basketball players."
PG - Steph Curry  SG - James Harden  SF - Kawhi Leonard  PF - LeBron James  C - Anthony Davis  BENCH - Kevin Durant (if healthy)  BENCH - Damian Lillard  BENCH - Kyrie Irving  BENCH - Paul George  BENCH - Russell Westbrook  BENCH - Blake Griffin  BENCH - Andre Drummond
Russell Westbrook now that he's moved to Houston is a premier ring chaser as well. I don't know if Ad counts I think he should.
"&gt; KD needed an elite playmaker who could run an offense, like Curry or Westbrook. The fact that a team's main offense was its huge playmaking shooter pretty much says just that, they were built around him with long defenders and a playmaker.  KD can run an offense himself if he has another efficient scorer on the team. This is pretty obvious when you look at his 2012 playoffs when he had Harden on the team, or the 2018 first round when he had Klay Thompson. I can literally show a million clips of OKC's terrible spacing in the 2016 playoffs and how it profoundly affected KD's performance.   &gt; The second part is demonstrably false, he's a good ball handler with elite playmaking and transition passing.  No he is not, [especially on the transition part](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/nba-insider-tom-haberstroh/rockets-russell-westbrook-gamble-wont-end-well).   &gt; When he is healthy, Westbrook plays like he’s shot out of a cannon, but it backfires far too often. Playing next to George was supposed to free up open shots and help Westbrook become more efficient. Instead, Westbrook became the worst version of himself, hijacking the offense with premature jumpers and getting careless in transition.  Westbrook ranked dead-last in transition efficiency among 27 players with at least 250 transition plays, according to Synergy Sports tracking. Only 22-year-old Ben Simmons coughed up the ball more times in these open-court situations, fueling the critique that Westbrook plays with a low basketball IQ even at this stage of his career. Fastbreak opportunities are normally an integral part of a healthy NBA offense. But in the case of Westbrook, his tendencies have become so hurtful last season that him finishing a transition play was less efficient than OKC’s halfcourt offense (0.87 points per play versus 0.93 points per play).  &gt; To add to that, ""OKC"" didn't make it out of the first round. In 2017 he was the best player on either team in round 1, yet a team that was built around KD that was missing KD couldn't win. A built around Russ team would be like the Bucks.  He was not the best player in that series because James Harden played in that series as well. And nope, the Bucks spacing would be fucked up because Westbrook isn't nearly as efficient as the rim as Giannis is."

It's how in the 60's Bill Russell was known as the best player on the planet and Wilt was known as a ball hog stat padder even by his own teammates. But 60 years later it's suddenly Wilt is better than Russell. Absolute nonsense. That'd be like in 50 years everyone started putting Russell Westbrook over Lebron.

"Are you trolling ? Or did you just start watching nba? Cuz your questions seems so off from your history. Kawhi is good but not that high. You’ve also asked if Giannis is better than prime Durant ( I’m a huge giannis fan but nah), is Russell Westbrook is the 3rd best pg of all time and better than KG, and why do ppl say Scottie Pippen was good since, in your words, he was just a bench player."
"OKC fan from Australia.  I had no interest in basketball until my friend showed me a Russell Westbrook montage of his dunks/game winners, his passion for the game made me fall in love with the sport. Too bad he moved on but I hope he gets a ring."
Russell Westbrook finishes 2019-2020 season shooting 47% from three on 8 attempts per game.
See: Russell Westbrook
Na you’re crazy. Tyler Herro is the future of the NBA. Thank god the Heat didn’t trade him for Russell Westbrook.
"Even rpm isn’t always a reliable stat though. 538 recently created a new defensive metric called DRAYMOND based on opponent shot data and it argues that Russell Westbrook is overrated by bpm stats. Interestingly, if you look at the draymond numbers for just this past season, James harden ranks high among guards."
"Russell Westbrook has the frame and athletic profile to dominate the WR position in the NFL. He's always my go-to argument on why NBA Starters are more athletic than NFL starters, but less explosive and strong.  They're all honestly the same level of athlete but with decades of different training regiments. The difference is that NBA players are going to have a bigger wingspan and are taller.   Anyway I digress"
"It's hard to say without watching football clips, but while he could probably make it in the NFL due to his sheer talent and work ethic he wouldn't be anywhere near the same star that he is in the NBA. Russell Westbrook would probably make a better NFL receiver."
Russell Westbrook is a good player
Lol don’t say that. I just watched Russell Westbrook get traded and the Thunder completely shift gears in a few weeks. Anything can happen in the NBA
Doesn't change the fact that the whole sale and move fiasco brought incredibly bad karma debt to a franchise that has only now been fully repaid when Paul George forced his way out and Russell Westbrook has been traded.   The fans had a good run but like I said they're a reason they were never going to win anything and KD knew it
"[The interactive version of this graph can be found here.](https://aka09.github.io/clutch_3pt.html) As you hover over points, you can get precise information about a specific player: name, clutch 3PA/game, and clutch 3P%.  **A few notes:** *** * ""Clutch"" is defined as the last 5 minutes of a game and a point differential of 5 points or less. * Only players who have attempted 80 3-pointers in such a situation are included. Relaxing this condition to 50 or 60 three pointers yields similar results. * Russell Westbrook is a historically poor 3-point shooter in the clutch. His combination of low shooting efficiency and high volume in the clutch is unique. He is 7% behind the second-worst clutch three point shooter with at least 0.9 attempt/game (Damian Lillard, surprisingly enough).  * In the clutch, 30.8% of Westbrook's field goal attempts are 3s, compared to 24.3% overall. He is one of the few star players whose free throw rate (i.e. the # of FTAs per field goal attempt) stays relatively stable in the clutch (.38 overall, .39 in the clutch). By comparison, the players who took the most shot attempts in the clutch between 2014-2019 generally saw their FTr increase dramatically in the last 5 minutes of a close game (shoutout to James Harden with a .82 FTr in such situations). In fact, among the 15 players with the most clutch shot attempts between 2014-2019, Westbrook is **dead last** in free throw rate. Surely, part of the explanation might be intentional fouls, but still.  * Steph Curry's exceptional shooting prowess is obvious here and very impressive.  * Even the best shooters tend to struggle in the clutch as defenses become laser-focused. Curry, for instance, is shooting threes at a 38% clip, which is far below what he usually averages. The same can be said for Lillard, Harden, Irving... * The ""LeFuckYou 3"" does seem to exist! LeBron is shooting clutch 3s at a 34% clip, which is similar to his overall 3P% and exceeds the performance of many top shooters.   This graph was made in R using the package nbastatR and ggplot2."
Dante Exum  Stephen Curry  Kyle Lowry  Russell Westbrook  Russell Westbrook (again)
"It’s Russell Westbrook in Utah, I don’t know how this isn’t an option. He’s already hated there and now he joined their most hated opponent."
"Derrick White and DeJounte Murray should be a terror on defense this next year. On offense, I'll bet on the Westbrook Harden experiment. However, I do think that Lillard/McCollum might be the best one off the bat. Curry is obviously great, but I might need to see Russell go off another year before I believe too much in that combo."
&gt;R/NBA today:   You can’t put a price on being the face of the franchise  &gt;R/NBA last week:  Russell Westbrook has the worst contract in the league after John Wall
Counterpoint: Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony
imagine if Draymond had Westbrook athleticism   Russell said he could kick the net of a hoop and touch the top of the backboard. He was ranked number 2 in the nation at one point for high jumps
Russell Westbrook UNREAL STAT PADDING AND BALL HOGGING! HIGHEST USG RATE IN NBA HISTORY! ALL HIGHLIGHTS!
"There are FIVE players on the court. You don't have to double off of Klay and Steph. You can simply double off of Draymond and Iguodala--which teams literally did. The difference was that KD had two shooters on the court that teams had to respect, just as he'd have in BK with Kyrie and Harris, and just like he did NOT have in OKC with Russell Westbrook and Andre Roberson (a 30% FT shooter).  I'm not talking about who can hit the most three point shots (as the Splash Brothers obviously win), but who teams have to respect when KD has the ball in his hand so as to not double team, which is the effect that Klay and Steph had and that Kyrie and Harris will produce. Of course the latter two aren't better, but the gap between them and Klay and Steph is way less severe than the gap between Russell Westbrook and 30% FT shooter."
"1. Did you seriously compare the '16-'17 Rockets without CP3 to the Rockets that won 67 games the next year? That same Rockets team that Russell Westbrook CHOKED to lost in 6 to the Spurs in a game in which Kawhi Leonard wasn't even playing in and which Jonathan Simmons was arguably the best player. How PATHETIC for you to compare the two teams when you clearly don't know what you're talking about him  2. The Grizzlies beat the Lob City Clippers, the Blazers were humiliated by the Pelicans in the first round the year before and ended up getting taken to 7 by a Nuggets team in their very FIRST playoffs. How are the two teams even similar? Also ignoring the fact that they took OKC to SEVEN games in TWO playoff series... LOL  3. Congrats they ""owned"" KD when his best teammate was Kevin Martin averaging 14.4 ppg. Fortunately KD didn't get gentleman swept by a team missing their second best player while also having a top 3 MVP candidtae in Paul George, nor did he lose to a fucking rookie while also having PG, Melo and Steven Adams. LMAO!  4. KD literally won in 2013 against the Rockets WITHOUT Russ. Russell Westbrook can't even win WITH a guy who placed THIRD in the MVP votes and also took LeBron to 7 and 6 games respectively in the EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS. LMAO! Of course KD would lose in five games to the Utah Jazz w/no Rubio or the Blazers team without Nurkic (who got swept by the Pelicans last year, LMAO) with Paul George as his teammate. That makes complete sense."
John Wall  Russell Westbrook   De’Aaron Fox  Ish Smith  Derrick Rose
"A guy who broke the record his rookie year playing against players who were 2 inches shorter than today whom also weighed nearly 20 pounds less on average. And the fact that these players were shooting the ball at historically low FG% is a testiment to the low skill level of all his peers. It doesn't take much flim to see that these guys werent skilled at the game of basketball in comparison to today's league. Wilt played against the least skilled era on basketball whole simultaneously being possibly the most athletic player ever no shit he'll be ridiculous and put up gawdy stat line. And league avgs being so low should have no correlation on his individual play since he was so far ahead of his peers athletically. 2000's Shaq playing against ZONE DEFENSE AND HAND CHECKING still managed to avg 57% from the field dispute league avg fg% rivaling that of the 60's so yeah your argument there makes no sense. 4 assists per game in an inflated era statistically is not impressive in the slightest. And you didn't even mention the fact that I still said players such as Shaq were still better passers than wilt chamberlain. Also using assists as the sole basis of an argument as whose the better passers is a casuals argument. Russell Westbrook is not a better passers than Jokic, Lebron, Chris Paul, James Harden, Steph Curry yet he led the league in assists."
"&gt; They were 2nd in ORtg because Russ led the team that year unanimously. He finished higher in MVP voting without a narrative/story. He was just flat out more important to the team and ran the offense. KD was the one who capitulated up 3-1 and then Russ followed suit. But since GSW was so successful (see: Stephen Curry) KD gets a perma-pass now  1. KD had forty points in Game 5, as opposed to the 7 TOs (is that a record) that Russ had in Game 5 2. KD went 10/31 in a Game 6, whilst Russ went 10/27 with 5 TOs (one of them wrongly attributed to him) in Game 6 3. KD went 10/19 with twenty-seven points, as opposed to the 7/21 shooting for 19 points from Westbrook (with a +/- of -14, to KD's -4). 4. Russ shot 32% while being guarded by Steph, while Steph shot 44% from the field. He was thoroughly outplayed by his opposite number ([https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4lahpm/russell\_westbrook\_is\_shooting\_32\_against\_steph/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4lahpm/russell_westbrook_is_shooting_32_against_steph/))     Russ was the main reason why OKC lost those final three games and his subsequent THREE successive first round exits (losing to Harden, and a crippled Utah and Blazers team) highlights why OKC would've been so much better if it was just KD and Harden."
"Charles Barkley in his prime would have been pretty awesome in current NBA. He is could pretty much be a taller Russell Westbrook. Grab a rebound, fly down the court, dunk. Would have to improve 3 to become a super star."
"*Russell Westbrook*? A player that is only capable of averaging 31/10/10? It's not gonna work. There is a *zero* percent chance Harden and Westbrook will mesh the way CP3 and Harden did. Harden and Westbrook have no chemistry. Have they even played a game of basketball together? Chris Paul and Harden were basically Jesse Pinkman and Walter White. They fucking COOKED. The way they complimented one another on the court is comparable to Goku and Vegeta fusing into Gogeta. I just don't see Harden and Westbrook adapting their games to make this work.  Let's face it... we all know the only reason Westbrook won an MVP is because of triple doubles; he doesn't even know how to play basketball. On the other hand, CP3? The Carl Sagan of basketball. We've never seen a player with such a high BBIQ grace us with their presence on the hardwood. Not only did the Rockets get worse, they also got dumber.   There's only ONE ball. Harden and Westbrook have the two highest usage rates in the league. Sure they may have each led the league in assists at one point, but you really think they'll *pass* the ball? Have you seen their turnover rate? The only thing they'll be assisting is the other team.  Don't even get me started on the playoffs. It's no secret that Harden is a playoff choker. 31/7/6 on 57% TS these playoffs? Come on... LeBron could do that that in his sleep.                                          The Rockets will NEVER win a ring playing the way they play now. Even *Kobe* said so. So I mean...¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Defense is going to be another major concern for the Rockets. Cp3 has more All-NBA Defensive First Team awards than Harden and Westbrook combined... Yeah. Let that sink in. 58 whole games of solid All-NBA Defense will no longer be there for the Rockets this season.  I spent the last week deciding how I feel about this trade, and this is the only logical conclusion I could come to. All in all, I'm rather disappointed and I'm pretty sure this may go down as the worst trade in NBA history.                                ^^^/s"
"1. He lost to a rookie in Donovan Mitchell and Gobert, who Harden swiftly dealt with in 5 games in successive years. How in the hell wouldn't have KD won? 2. He lost in the first year to Harden, despite his team actually shooting better from 3 that series (look it up) and couldn't even win two games. 3. He lost to a Blazers team w/o their starting center and was thoroughly outplayed by Dame. How in the hell would KD lose to the Blazers in 5 with PG being there along with him to assist him? The same PG that took LeBron to seven and six in 2013 and 14 in the ECF 4. KD won an MVP in a season in which Russell Westbrook missed 40 games and he managed to attain the #2 spot in a Western Conference that was at the most competitive than it had ever been (Spurs, Clippers, Rockets, Blazers, Mavs, Grizzlies) and won 59 games that year, with his next best players being Ibaka and Reggie Jackson. How in the hell would he have struggled to do what Russ did that year when the West was at its weakest point ever that year? Additionally, the very next year, Russell Westbrook MISSED the playoffs with the same supporting cast that KD, losing to Anthony Davis who was in his second season, and also a year in which half of the NBA was injured  &amp;#x200B;  Please don't compare the two players. You can go on about how ""Russ is an alpha, because he makes weird facial expressions and gets triple doubles"", but KD is light years ahead of him as a basketball player and it isn't even close."
Did you know that Russell Westbrook made 100% of his shots 42.8% of the time last year

"are you fucking disrespecting Russell Westbrook, mate?"
Russell Westbrook disliked that
"What do you think advanced stats measure? They measure WINNING by a better metric. They have to be taken in context, obviously. But thinking Westbrook is better because his stat line HAS TWO DIGITS in every place is asinine.   I want Westbrook to win a championship. I think he’s incredible and a force of nature. I think the rockets are legit contenders. But the way Russell Westbrook played in OKC was overvalued because people lose their mind when they saw two separate marks instead of one.   Westbrook season this year was far better than his MVP year.  That’s was the most narrative driven MVP in recent times."
Kyrie is a more talented player than Kemba walker and Russell Westbrook and people who think otherwise are fools. Only lillard and curry are above him in terms of point guards
"Idk if maybe you're a new fan or if you just don't have great memory, but he was definitely in top 10 at certain points I'd say top 5. As for superstar. You said    [Proof 1](https://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/05/mvp-ladder-2017-18-week-12-bradley-beal-development-kevin-durant-rises)   [Proof 2](https://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/26/mvp-ladder-2017-18-week-15-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-reemerges)   [Proof 3](https://www.nba.com/article/2017/12/22/mvp-ladder-week-10-christmas-day-mvp-candidates)   [Proof 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfEeSTdQXWc)   &gt; So if that’s true, how can you say boogie is definitively a superstar when he’s never done so.   I don't have a history of helping 3rd graders win postseason games to know I would impact winning against 3rd graders in the postseason lmfao. If you're a great at this game of basketball, you're great at basketball."
"I disagree because I think the roster really was that bad. Oladipo won MIP the next year for a reason, Sabonis was a starting rookie who ended up getting benched, Steven didnt quit have a post game yet, and of course Dre couldn’t shoot. Taj was pretty good, but then you get into the ugly part of the roster. Not yet developed Jerami Grant and Doug McDermott, old Nick Collison, and non-NBA players like Payne, Christon, Lauvergne, and Morrow.  Who else on that team handles the ball in a way that would be more productive than 28 year-old Russell Westbrook?"
"Yeah, not mine but this one:  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  &gt;Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  &gt;That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  Its a few months old now, but KD did the same thing and zero people cared.  Because it wasn't 10 rebounds."
An untradable contract! Win. 2 picks ehhh it sucks but holy shit we got rid of Cp3! OH YEAH AND WE GET RUSSELL WESTBROOK! That's a fucking A+ trade for us.
"Harden decided to trade Harden  “As Wojnarowski reported, Oklahoma City offered Harden a four-year extension ""that would have paid him a base salary of $53 million to $54 million,"" making it at least $6 million shy of the $60 million max.  But that wasn't good enough for Harden. He's a budding young superstar and undoubtedly believed it was time he got paid like one, even after teammates and self-proclaimed ""family"" members Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka and Russell Westbrook made some sort of sacrifice to stay in Oklahoma City.”  -Bleacher Report  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1389202-why-kendrick-perkins-contract-forced-okc-thunder-to-trade-james-harden"
Celtics fan that lives in Wisconsin here...I’ve said the same thing. He can definitely be unstoppable but seeing a lot of him (TV/in person) he just feels like an over-grown Russell Westbrook that just has a couple paint moves and freakish athleticism!
"It's the honest take man!  Just not what you want to hear.  People keep assuming Indianapolis Oladipo was the guy playing for our team, and he wasn't.   He was complete ass in the playoffs -- Andre Roberson was our 2nd leading scorer!   The +/- numbers with Westbrook on and off the court were absolutely absurd.    I don't know who was on that team that makes people think Russell doing less would be good, so please let us know who should have been getting more touches!  The team had 0 backup plan to be decent without KD there -- they were planning on a KD and Russ recruited Al Horford as well.  That team was desolate when Westbrook didn't have the ball in his hands."
Kyrie has world class performances in the finals and Russell Westbrook has been bounced out the first round with MVP candidates multiple times.
"I mean you guys had Russell Westbrook Kevin Durant *and* James Harden along with Ibaka and other solid bench players. You made 3 conference finals and one finals in which you won 1 game. All of this in the 8 or so seasons since you drafted KD.  Don't respond with the ""but injuries"" argument. Every team suffers injuries over more than 1 or 2 seasons. The Heat *could* have been champs in '05 but for Wades injuries. We *could* have competed in '07 but for Wade and Shaq's injuries.  You guys had several great drafted players and failed to do win even 1 championship with them. Don't you dare criticize a franchise that has won 3."
"This hits is two of my biggest nba pet peeves: One of the most overrated and one of the most underrated players compared in this thread (with the 3rd one often properly rated).  Dirk: Somewere between 13-20 all-time (nice peak, elite longevity, 1-team-player, amazing teammate, revolutionised the PF position) which most people agree with, not much to discuss about.  Duncan: So freakin' underrated!!! Arguably the second best defender in NBA history (after Bill Russell), amazing teammate, proven winner and leader and (with all due respect for the aging Admiral, Manu, Tony Parker and growing Kawhi) his teams didn't look as fearsome as some of Jordans, Russels, KAJs or Lebrons teams. And yeah, Pop/Buford are great, but they are not on the court.  Garnett: The ""NBA-Intelligensia's"" great circle jerk. He was such a great defender, Minnesota wasted him, had only terrible teammates, only needed a good coach/team to win it all.  His defense: The racial bias hits hard. Don't want to meet him in a dark alley at night, but the aggressive big black man has to be a great defender. Don't want go too far into the sad consequences thoses biases have for society and especially black man at large, but it plays a role in the perception of Garnett. You hate Westbrook for stat-hunting? At least he wins more than 80% of triple-double games, KGs ""great"" statistical games correlate win winning a lot poorer. He was really good 1 vs. 1 in Minnesota, but boxing out for the team? Nah! Being all over the opposing player? Sure! Falling back to against defend cutters and rim-rollers? Hell no! Effort? Yeah! Encouraging and leading the team? LOL! For most of the time in Minnesota he was on a middle-of-the-road-pace team with coaches that were often more known for defense, than creative offense. His teammates were by no means all-time great defenders, but only because their names don't ring a bell for many now, doesn't mean they were scrubs on that end. People who didn't watch Minnesota games (nobody did) just assume he was amazing, but take a look at Minny's defensive ratings (1 elite year, 2-3 good ones). But in Boston...? Yep, there he finally stopped the hunting for rebounds and blocks, played team defense and became elite. Should we therefore forget everything before that?  &amp;#x200B;  Minnesota wasted him/terrible teammates: The pick-punishment disaster! Well, they lost 4 first-rounders, one of which was in the lottery, that hurts! But rookies around pick 20 are also not what usually wins you games or even play defense. So free agency can needs to help. Nobody wants to play in Minnesota? A few actually wanted and played well (03/04). But when your star player bullies half the roster you might lose appeal. He is obviously not as bad as the rapists, wife beaters and murderers in NBA history, but of the non-criminal ones, Garnett is one of the worse human beings. The trial-by-fire-approach in team building is so terrible by modern standards and glorifying it is toxic.   Mitchell, Wally, Sprewell, Cassell, Hudson, Terrell Brandon, Marbury, Gugliotta, even Olowokandi were nice for a small market team and Tim Duncan or even Nowitzki would have (imo) achieved more with them.  &amp;#x200B;  Only needed a good coach/team to win it all: Duh!  &amp;#x200B;  Don't compare Garnett, who made his own bed and had to lay in it (for good and for bad) to the great Dirk and never ever even think about doing it in regards to Duncan."
"i actually disagree.  it allows users to go much more into depth into what they are thinking and explain themselves a lot better.  r/nbadiscussions isnt for ""Well i think Russell Westbrook will work out in Houston because him and Harden are friends.  They also agreed to play together so they should be able to make it work.""  r/nbadiscussion comments tend to try to go into depth about play styles and comparing other players and the like.  That is very hard to do in 3 or 4 sentences.  i think most users are off put by r/nbadiscussion because they dont like to read that much."
Morey traded Chris Paul's untradable contract for Russell Westbrook in his prime. The man is a wizard.
"Uhhh... what about Kevin Durant, shit head lol? You know, one of the best scorers of all time.   You're sitting here comparing Russell Westbrook to KG, when Westbrook had Durant who has already surpassed both of them on the GOAT list."
That was for Seattle  And winning the series  And for a max contract  And to send home Russell Westbrook  And to send home the Thunder  And to progress to winning a championship  And for Portland  And to say “that was for Seattle” in hopes of getting new fans”  And to make headlines  And because fuck Oklahoma City
"There were far, FAR more pressing issues than Westbrook on that roster. Russell’s rampage was the only thing keeping the Thunder from being in the deep lotto.  Maybe there were some tweaks Russell could have made. It wouldn’t result in anything more than an extra win or two. There’s only so much “better” available on that roster, and Westbrook had already used up most of it."
"It's not that Chris Paul is an elite off ball player, it's that Russell Westbrook is one of the worst off ball star players in the league."
"&gt;Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Eric Gordon and Austin Rivers  I don't see 4 guards.  I see the Rockets starting PG, PF, SG, and SF."
"The link has really annoying ads on mobile. Here's the copypasta.   A native Oakland, Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard is not afraid to let us know what’s on his mind.  It’s led to some petty spats with other players around the Association. It’s also what makes Lillard a truly different individual.  In talking about his series-clinching Game 5 three-pointer against the Oklahoma City Thunder in this year’s playoffs, Lillard took that to an entirely new level. “What can I say? That was for Seattle,” Lillard told Sports Business Radio this week.  Man, it’s not enough that Dame legitimately put an end Oklahoma City with that dagger in the first round of the playoffs. No, he had to add salt to the wound.  Lillard is obviously talking about the Seattle Sonics relocating to Oklahoma City back in 2008. That move still doesn’t sit well with west coast folk.  Game 5 of the first round also represented the final time both Paul George and Russell Westbrook suited up for Oklahoma City. It came in Portland, a mere three-hour drive from the Thunder’s old stomping grounds in Seattle."
"So in other words,  The Grizzlies were expected to be a losing team, and the Grizzlies had a reputation as the worst NBA team in history at that point in time, and they go from an expected 30 wins to 50 wins; coached by the oldest coach in NBA history who had been doing color commentary a year and a half earlier.   But Sloan took a crapola roster to 42 wins. A roster that no longer had older Karl Malone &amp; John Stockton who has the worst numbers of their career since their early seasons. But they had AK. And good players who could run Sloan’s system. They won 5 fewer games. A healthy Matt Harpering, Raja Bell, and Arroyo were good NBA quality players. They didn’t have stars but they had NBA players.  So I just don’t get why this is even a debate. Especially when Jazz fans (and a raptors fan) want to crap on what Hubie Brown did as if it was expected. I remember the shock and excitement in Memphis that season.   I think Lionel Hollins was cheated out of the COY in the 2009-10 season. The Grizz were expected to be crap. They won 24 games the season before and Hollins was seen as a joke by much of the local media. They added “black hole” and “cancer” Zach Randolph and an old, grumpy Allen Iverson to the team. It was supposed to be a shit show. But they competed for a playoff spot until almost the end of the season. Won 40 games. But Scott Brooks took an OKC team that had Kevin Durant (in season 3), Russell Westbrook, and James Harden to 50 wins when they had won 23 games the prior year."
"This time next year we’re gonma have:  Daniel House, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden combine for 167 points in a game on the same team"
"Imagine, 2 fast-paced guards, who are okay at shooting but sometimes brick them, merged into one... I give you.... Russell Westbrook!"
“How do you get 12 assists after you leave the team with Kevin Durant?”   “Russell Westbrook”
"&gt; Something else that's notable Is that John Wall, Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul all went from being some of the most valuable pieces in the league to being basically negative assets thanks to the supermax.   Wall and CP3 would both be negative assets on a regular max. Everyone blames the supermax but a regular max is more than enough to ruin your team if the player gets seriously injured (bring back amnesty provision kthx) and giving a 34yo player a long-term max contract is just setting your team up for failure whether or not it's a supermax."
"&gt; People are calling CP3 washed because he’s 34 years old, has missed  &gt; almost 50 games in the last two seasons, and is considerably worse on  &gt; defense  Most of this is true of LeBron too, but I wouldn't call him washed. Yet people are saying it about CP3 just because he has lost a great deal of his scoring efficacy in the past season, something that is also true of Westbrook  &gt; Russell Westbrook is inefficient but he isn’t washed up  Over the past two years Westbrook's scoring has dropped over 11 (!!!) points per 75 possessions in the regular season, all while his efficiency has dropped over 6 percentage points of true shooting compared to league average. He really appears to be on a rapid downward trajectory"
Russell Westbrook with a jumper/three. Unstoppable
"Here's my list, tell me who is rated too high:   1. Kawhi Leonard 2. Steph Curry 3. James Harden 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. LeBron James 6. Anthony Davis 7. Joel Embiid 8. Nikola Jokic 9. Paul George 10. Damian Lillard  11. Jimmy Butler 12. Blake Griffin 13. Draymond Green 14. Karl-Anthony Towns 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kristaps Porzingis 17. Rudy Gobert 18. Jrue Holiday 19. Kyrie Irving  20. Bradley Beal 21. Kemba Walker 22. Lamarcus Aldridge 23. Mike Conley 24. Devin Booker 25. Pascal Siakam 26. Kyle Lowry 27. Ben Simmons 28. Nikola Vucevic 29. Zion Williamson  30. DeMar DeRozan"
"What happened to Russell ""I've been busting that ass for years"" Westbrook?"
"Do you know what washed even means? Washed means “washed up” as in on the decline of your career because you aren’t producing anymore. People are calling CP3 washed because he’s 34 years old, has missed almost 50 games in the last two seasons, and is considerably worse on defense. Russell Westbrook is inefficient but he isn’t washed up. WTF kind of take is that?"
"They haven't played together and made a deep playoff run like this Rockets team, only exception is Russell Westbrook. That's how lol"
“Russell Westbrook plans to change the Rockets’ offense next season regardless of Mike D’Antoni”
Where’s Russell Westbrook?
"Cute: Luka Doncic  Sexy: Kelly Oubre  Bad Boy: Russell Westbrook   Eclectic One: Jimmy Butler  Talented: Damian Lillard, and we let him do lead vocals"
"I don't know how clear cut it is and I'd kinda favor Kyrie.  [Here is a direct stat comparison from last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=kyrie+Irving&amp;player_id1_select=Kyrie+Irving&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=irvinky01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players).  Westbrook gets better rebound and assist numbers no matter how you cut it.  However, Westbrook is a significantly worse shooter, especially from 3.  He also turns it over significantly more often.  The advanced stats mostly favor Kyrie except DPBM (indicating significantly better defense from Westbrook) and VORP.    The intangibles probably help Westbrook however.  Westbrook is far more durable, missing far fewer games over his career than Kyrie.  They're both kinda nuts, but Westbrook might be a better kind of nuts.  Kyrie also has the advantage of playing in the East, which helps just about everyone's stats."
It depends on what you need for your team [but Kemba had the better year in advance stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1=westbru01&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id2_hint=Kemba+Walker&amp;player_id2_select=Kemba+Walker&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=walkeke02&amp;idx=players)
"I'm a Celtics fan.  I hope that Russell Westbrook takes less shots and plays better team basketball, and that James Harden stops flopping so dang much.   It's just so hard to watch. He has the skill set to get to the rim. Maybe Russ will help him play with more grit and heart, and less free throws from flops."
"Also, it’s fucking Russell with 2 L’s. Always. Whether you mean DLo, Westbrook, Kurt...  TWO L’S!!!!!!!!!"
"""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."" - Russell Westbrook"
"Exactly this.  If you could come up with 3 ball dominant players that run an offense as well as Harden, your list would likely be Chris Paul, LeBron James, and Russell Westbrook (maybe a healthy Wall, too).  However, Westbrook's style is more similar to Hardens than CP3's, and I think that'll help make the team more cohesive.     Westbrook and Harden will both try to drive and score, then make plays if the defense allows them to.  CP3 is much more of a playmaker first before a scorer, especially at this stage in his career.  It should be easier for guys like Gordon, Tucker, House, Green, etc to get used to a single playstyle from Harden/Westbrook rather than having to constantly adjust between Hardens and Paul's playstyles."
My great great grandkids who never knew me or Russ will celebrate Russell Westbrook day.
I'd edit it and say Harden and Westbrook. Kinda confusing having james twice and Russell (spelling) twice.
“We leave for Houston at dawn!”   -Russell Westbrook probably
Absolutely.  Their needs to be variation and Westbrook is the best with the ball in his hands.  Resting both will be the priority over the season and having Russell run the second team is almost unfair (as was CP3 in 2018).  The real challenge will be them figuring out how to live together on the court again.     I think you’ll either see Westbrook improve his 3% percentage on spot up shots or he will handle the ball while Harden spots up (and actually works at it).  There’s allot of little stuff that also needs to happen but unless one of those two things happen it’s gonna be clunky.
"PG:  Russell Westbrook (I'm convinced some people genuinely see him as a net negative solely based on his TS%)  SG:  Caris LeVert (I don't know when, but he WILL make an all-NBA team one day)  SF:  Danilo Gallinari (injured history, offensive beast when healthy)  PF/C:  Giles and Bagley (everyone talks about Fox/Hield, but this frontcourt duo is going to dominate the league when they're older)"
Russell Westbrook if he doesn't resort to shooting bricks.
Westbrook vs Riley would’ve been amazing.  Anytime Russ tried to pull some shit Riley could just empty his bag of rings on the table.   “How many do you have doing ‘what you want’ Russell?”
"I looked it up and Charizard is 5'0 198 lb, that's shorter than Mugsy Bogues and heavier than Russell Westbrook. He's a tank!"
"PG: Russell Westbrook: People act like he's a negative asset and that's just foolish. He's a top 12 player at worst and has shown he can carry teams to the playoffs. Your team only gets better with Westbrook on it.  SG: Dwayne Bacon: I never hear anything about him anywhere. His numbers aren't anything that jump out, but he was a highly efficient player last season and made some great improvements from his rookie season. He has continued to improve since college and I expect some good numbers from him on an awful Charlotte team.   SF: Kevin Knox. Statistically he was awful last year. But many people don't understand the context. He was asked to take on a role he wasn't ready for which resulted in stats which showcased him as one of the worst players in the league. If he was given a role appropriate to his skill set, his numbers would have been a lot better. He was also 19 years old. He's going to be a solid player  PF: Kevin Love. I think this is more due to a younger audience on here, but Love was a beast in Minnesota. He's not just some third wheel catch and shoot guy. He was definitely a top 15 player in Minnesota.  C: Jonas Valanciunas: I was happy when the trade for Gasol was made, but I don't think Valanciunas gets his due. He's improved defensively each year, he's a beast on the boards, he can score at will down low, and he can stretch the defense."
We still celebrate russell westbrook day every day
"Last year for defensive deal plus minus, among starting point guards, Curry was behind Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Derrick White, Patrick Beverly, Eric Bledsoe, Lonzo Ball, Jrue Holiday, and Ricky Rubio.  He was in front of guys like Ben Simmons, DeAaron Fox, Kyrie Irving, Goran Dragic, Malcolm Brogdon, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, Kris Dunn, D’Angelo Russell, Tyus Jones, Jeff Teague, Jamal Murray, Shia Gilgeous Alexander, Rajon Rondo, Kemba Walker, Derrick Rose, Collin Sexton, and Trae Young."
"Looking back on it, the thought that Carmelo Anthony And Russell Westbrook playing together would produce winning basketball is pretty funny actually"
"Of course he is, also happy Russell Westbrook Day."
Literally every day in OKC is Russell Westbrook day.
"Live by the Kobe, die by the Kobe.  And Kobe has said that [Westbrook is the one player who reminds him most of himself as far as emotion, grit and intensity goes](https://www.lakersnation.com/kobe-bryant-says-russell-westbrook-reminds-him-most-of-himself/2016/08/26/)"
But would Russell Westbrook stay on the Thunder knowing he could get 150M more over 3 years elsewhere?
Every day is Westbrook day in OKc.  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/09/oklahoma-city-thunder-mayor-russell-westbrook-day-every-signed-extension-new-deal
 Russell Westbrook
"They legit stole and MVP with a shit contract on CP3 that HAS NEGATIVE VALUE.   &amp;#x200B;  I feel like it would take first rounders just to get another team to take him, much less to give you fucking russell westbrook.  &amp;#x200B;  FUCKKK"
"If you think about it, Russell Westbrook is what you get if you took like an actual rocket from like NASA or something, and turned it into a basketball player."
I seriously can't believe all the mfers on this post agreeing with this shit. It really shows how many people actually watch basketball. Blazers fanswant love and assets for Bazemore and Collins? You're fucking kidding right?  OKC got pics for taking on CP3 because they TRADED RUSSELL WESTBROOK. The team that got the worse player also got picks.
"“This kid, Russell Westbrook gives 100 and 20, 30, 40, 50% every single game, and all he does is get criticized”"
Rockets if u want a team that’s gonna win the chip next season. We got James Harden and Russell Westbrook; the 2 hungriest players in the league.
Russell Westbrook is Allen Iverson playing in the wrong era
"Raymond ""Cupcake"" Felton. Gave up on the Blazers, and caused a mutiny in the locker room. Showed up to camp and the team out of shape and just in general didn't want to be in Portland.  Markieff Morris - always pulls off some bullshit at the end of games against Portland and probably other teams (holding Seth Curry, being out of bounds and not getting called for it) or acts like an enforcer and acts tough. Gets booed.  KD - enough said. It's KD.  Russell Westbrook - obnoxious, outspoken, talks trash. ""I've been bustin that ass for years"" - didn't happen, and then got wrecked in 5 games."
"Playing 12 minutes a game for 32 games is not ""regular minutes"".  Of thier top 10 players in terms of minutes played :  1	Russell Westbrook 2	Victor Oladipo 3	Andre Roberson 4	Steven Adams 5	Enes Kanter 6	Taj Gibson 7	Ersan İlyasova 8	Domantas Sabonis 9	Doug McDermott 10	Jerami Grant  Every single one of them is still in the league. Even if they were worse back then, they still belonged in the NBA.  After WCS (who btw is out , along with Looney) the warriors don't have a single NBA quality rotation player. Maybe Chriss and some others will grow into this, regardless they don't have a single +defender outside of draymond that's healthy on this roster.  Dipo, Roberson, Adams, Taj, Grant are all above average to amazing defenders (even back then and especially in the regular season)"
"Westbrook and Harden had better players. Period. There are three good players on GS. The rest are among the worst players in the league. Look at Westbrook's mvp season roster and look at the Warriors now. The bench and even starters are laughable outside of Draymond and Russell, especially defensively"
"I get what you're saying and I agree on the timeline.  But at the same time, I think the point OP is making is that people were so quick to discount the difficulty of what other superstars did in the past when they were doing it, because they were unwilling to give them credit in comparison to Steph Curry in a perfect situation.  It is NOT easy to carry a team without other threats. That's very special. I'm not sure Steph is capable of it. That's something that only a LeBron James, James Harden, Russell Westbrook can do. Players that are an entire system unto themselves. They're sturdier and stronger and can by sheer force of will bend an opposing team. They are just as generational talents as a Curry with his sharpshooting when he's open. They can't shoot 3s like Curry can but Curry also can't carry a team like they can."
"Yeah, just looking at the top minutes played for the OKC 2016 season:  &amp;#x200B;  Russell Westbrook  Steven Adams  Andre Roberson  Victor Oladipo  Domantas Sabonis	  Enes Kanter  Jerami Grant  Álex Abrines  &amp;#x200B;  That's 8 legit NBA players, and this doesn't include Taj who only played in 30 or so games"
"That talent level has increased dramatically, and if you think otherwise you are fooling yourself.  Second best players on playoff teams 4-8, 2006:  Andre Miller, Cuttino Mobley, Lamar Odom, Ron Artest, Mike Miller.  Second best players on playoff teams 4-8, 2019:  Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan, Lou Williams"
James Harden and Russell Westbrook having a heated discussion was newsworthy. Everytime Lebron throws his hands up on defense it's bad body language. But robot man = good.
"Very true, never forget the time that according to Royce Young Russ stopped in the middle of a game to beg the official scorer to give him credit for a tip rebound, to complete a triple double. Wild.   https://deadspin.com/russell-westbrook-got-a-triple-double-last-night-on-t-1691463808"
Russell Westbrook is pretty fuckin cool
"But...Kristaps was going to leave anyway and had we not done anything he was most likely going to leave for *free,* which would have given this sub another thread where they can spam and rag on Knicks fans for decisions out of their control.  **""HA. LOLKNICKS AMIRITE!!!"" /s**  Yes, yesterday was ugly and messy but lets not act like that the Knicks are the only organization that's done stuff like this or has had fans act in irrational ways.  Just last season Celtics fans were telling Kyrie Irving that he sucked and were booing him, only to find out that his grandfather had passed away at the start of last year's season after the man signed to the Nets.  Then you have Thunder fans literally shooting bullet holes into Kevin Durant's jersey &amp; all the Cavaliers fans who burned LeBron's jersey.  Or how about the Philadelphia 76ers fan that flipped Russell Westbrook, or all of those Philly fans who got into a fight with Mike Scott, or how about the Utah Jazz fans who called various NBA players derogatory names and slurs.  ...but somehow when Knicks fans do it, we're the worst people in the universe and quote on quote ""deserve"" to have a terrible team owned by one of the most greedy, amoral people on the planet.  I'm not going to excuse yesterday's actions, **it was bad**. However, I'm sick and tired of r/nba taking any and all situations to basically beat down on the already mutilated corpse that is the Knicks when everyone and their great-grandfather already knows that our organization is far from being the best.  ***How about instead of ragging on the Knicks, we instead use our energies to give our prayers out to Dennis Smith Jr. &amp; his family in his time of hardship???***"
"""plus he’s 31 now so he won’t want to go 100% every night""   Russell westbrook would like a word."
Losing Russell Westbrook sucks   Gaining SGA certainly does not suck
"its not higher than every other star in the league and 4.3 is pretty high for someone not averaging 6+ assists a game. Giannis averaged 3.7 last year and he averaged 6 assists a game and he was decently turnover prone. its only been 2-3 games so its not really worth mentioning as a trend yet but 4.3 is not good unless your a james harden, russell westbrook, or lebron james averaging 8+ assists a game with 27 points."
are you saying that Curry is not as much as an offensive threat on ball than Russell Westbrook? what am I reading in this thread?
"I think there is bigger reason to assume they go up considering the extra spacing and shooters on the floor. Extra spacing and shooters means Russ has more room to battle for rebounds as well as him not taking all of the shots means he can position himself better for more rebounds. Having better shooters around him is more reason to assume more assists. He only needs 23 ish minutes of play to put up a triple double.  Edit: higher tempo offense + more frequent shooting = more rebounds to go around.   Also, forget about those notions that Russ rebounds are handed to him. He earns, fights, scraps for them. I dont see anybody who is taking away a rebound from Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook is not the only one getting them at a higher rate. They are much more common in today’s game. Yes he is the best at them and it is worth noting/impressive but ignoring the context is disingenuous

God bless Russell Westbrook.

Russell Westbrook will easily be the leader in triple doubles when his career finishes.

Russell Westbrook. Bonus that they drafted him to be their pg when he’d never played the position
Russell Westbrook has left the chat.
"But statistically speaking, they aren’t “the same, or worse”, every measurement points to them being more efficient offensive players.    Even guys like Okogie- who suck on offense, just on defensive impact alone are a better option than Wiggins. You wouldn’t want any single one of them playing 30+ minutes a game- but staggering those minutes is key.   And hey, I understand the homer need to cling to your players. My team drafted Michael Beasley over Russell Westbrook- I get it, but let’s not stray into the realm of delusion."
"Just because I was curious, Wiggins is 12th  11977 - James Harden  10048 - Russell Westbrook  9684 - Damian Lillard  9524 - Stephen Curry  9391 - LeBron James  8823 - Anthony Davis  8542 - DeMar DeRozan  8478 - Kemba Walker  8322 - Klay Thompson  8250 - Giannis Antetokounmpo   8089 - Kevin Durant  7789 - Andrew Wiggins"
I feel like people really try to jump through hoops to convince themselves that Russell Westbrook is a star nba player. He’s a role player with opportunity
"Starting at Guard, 6’3″ from UCLA, number 0,     RUSSELL WESTBROOK"
What a stupid arbitrary reason that is. There’s superstars that do far less honorable things than him and get 2x more respect. Were KD and Lebron making honorable decisions when they wanted to stack the deck to win? Does Russell Westbrook have no honor for the game when he hogs the ball? Does Steph Curry have no honor for doing his shimmies? Did AD and PG have no honor for wanting out of their rightful contractual obligations?   You can literally do this about every superstar.
"Lol there’s no way he’s a negative asset. A team like the Timberwolves would give up quite a bit to have him on their team, this isn’t a 30 year old declining Russell Westbrook on a supermax. This is a 23 year old all star with a fair bit of upside."
James Harden  Russell Westbrook
"It's grudge if you can't go back now and look at a play now for what it truly is. A natural basketball play.  Russell didn't play till the whistle and Beverly did.  He got lazy and tried to recover late and put his knee into Pat Bev's path, and Beverly never altered his motion to adjust his body to intentionally hit Westbrook.  Westbrook moved his knee, into Pat Bev's path.  I'm sorry you're confused but you, are without a doubt, holding a grudge."
"Russell Westbrook was an awesome player at one point, I’m just not pretending he still is.  Deangelo Russell is enormously overrated, period"
"I'm the size of Russell Westbrook and have played in an NBA Arena for a game before. The seats really were pretty damn comfortable.  Can't speak for the 7 footers, but I like the NBA seats compared to the shitty actual folding chairs I usually sat on at the time"
"Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love the way Pat Bev plays, but it’s just all the other stuff that bugs me. There’s a big difference between talking shit when your career has been as stellar as Draymond’s vs. when your career highlight is either injuring Russell Westbrook or “putting the clamps on” KD in the playoffs last year, limiting him to 35/5/5 on 57/40/95 shooting splits."
"LeBron needed insane shots by Ray Allen and Kyrie and insanely boneheaded decisions by Draymond and Popovich to avoid being 1-7 in the finals. As it is, he has a losing record against every other major star he ever played against in the finals except Russell Westbrook, who has zero playoff series wins without Kevin Durrant."

"I've always liked watching Russell Westbrook, but it's rather painful to watch Harden play next to him. Harden needs to play better and stop foul baiting and ball hogging now. It really makes no sense with Westbrook there.  And also the idiotic fast break 3."
His name is Russell Westbrook
The intensity of russell westbrook!!!
Lillard went at Westbrook last post season. But that's just probably because Russell was the smallest dude on the other team
"Imagine if Curry can’t lead this team to the playoffs. Just think about how that affects his legacy (albeit to a small degree)  If Russell Westbrook could take a team of scrubs, who’s second best player was a raw Oladipo? to the 6th seed, avg a triple double and win MVP   The very least Curry can do is lead a team with DLo and Dray to the playoffs."
"I mean the guy may not be the best shooter early on, but in close games with shooters around him give the god damn ball to Russell Westbrook. Eric Gordon and James Harden combined for 6-32 from the field. I mean come on.   &amp;#x200B;  We set the man free to get away from Billy Donovan then MD takes him out during the run? What the actual fuck?"
&gt; **Russell Westbrook joins Hakeem Olajuwon** **as the only Rockets players**   What a timeline
"I was going to add “in the loss”, but then I noticed you already said Russell Westbrook."
"I hope he does this every game. This is the Russell Westbrook the Rockets need to win. Eric Gordon and Harden will very rarely shoot that bad. If Russ does most of his work at the rim, makes good passes, and takes 3s only in catch and shoot situations like he did today, the Rockets will be great. I wouldn't like to talk about the alternative."

So glad Russell Westbrook can finally play with deadeye shooters like Ben Mclemore
"James Harden. Big guard that plays basically combo guard, but is very good at running an offense, offensive game that hinges on his creative handle, excellent court vision and ability to both shoot and draw fouls. Neither are very explosive in the sense that a guy like Russell Westbrook or Zach LaVine are, but are extremely agile despite their size and heft. He also reminded me a bit of KD when he was still a prospect, though I see less of Durant in him the more I see of him in the NBA. Harden’s def my favorite comp for him."
"Russell ""ineffective self"" Westbrook with 5 assists and 6 rebounds before the half."

Russell Westbrook / D'Angelo Russell
"it all started with Paul George, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony"
"Why is he Salty? Because it's the truth? People need to stop with this ""coming home"" bullshit when the player isn't even from LA.  Russell Westbrook and James Harden are from LA.  Kawhi is from the Inland Empire and PG is from the Antelope Valley.  Hell, Kawhi isn't even from LA county!"
Honestly it’s VERY UNDERRATED. Having a PG get the board gives the offense a chance to bull rush the defense for an easy transition score. Especially with a guard like DJ who’s 6’5 with a 7ft wingspan and elite defense.   Rebounding is one of the big reasons Russell Westbrook is the legend he is today
"Starting at Guard, 6’3″ from UCLA, number 0,     RUSSELL WESTBROOK"
"Hes getting the recognition through his contract .  The salary cap has nearly doubled from 7 years ago when he entered the league.     His $13 mil/yr contract that he just got put him in line with what Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook were getting paid 7 years ago (when they were already all stars by the way) .  This increase in money is very much tied to the interest by the casual fan, stuff like dunks or highlight blocks.  It's a business .  Yeah I agree it is dumb , but theres options for those of us who enjoy the game beyond dunks  However, for the NBA media to gear their content to the minutae of under-the-radar defensive plays that Bev does so well, it would result in far less fan interest, far less money for the league to make , far less money in patrick Beverly's pocket.  It's a necessary evil"
"&gt;Instead of starting Russell Westbrook this year the rockets should have him come off the bench to spot Harden at times.  Dude do you even watch the Rockets? They will start Harden with Westbrook and Gordon for a majority of games because that is by far the best option to come out of the gates with. Westbrook will go to the bench and then relieve Harden and come back in with the second unit. This has literally been the Rockets recipe for the past 2 years with CP3, they start 3 guards with Tucker and Capela."
"Iirc in the 2016 USA team, KD was a little envious of how close DeMar and Kyle were and wanted something like that.  Edit: Here's Kalaimian, a former OKC and Raptors coach in 2016 about a text that Durant sent him.  &gt;""Your two guys are the best. I'm jealous of their relationship, the way they get along with each other and the way they play together. The way they enjoy each other, it's great,"" Kalamian said of that text on Monday, as the Raptors finished up their practice. Durant, all the way from the Olympics in Rio, was in awe of the friendship that Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan had on display with the U.S. men's basketball team.  &gt;""I think it's kind of what he wants,"" Kalamian continued. ""He wants that bond with someone . . . and I think he's going to find that.  &gt;""Early on in OKC, we had that.""  &gt;...  &gt;""We had that (bond) really with James Harden. He was a connector of everyone. He brought Westbrook, Durant and (Serge) Ibaka and they all kind of connected, they all came together,"" Kalamian said.  &gt;""James is a big reason and when he left I think Kevin said . . . that trade was the beginning of the end for him and now there wasn't that connection as much.  &gt;""Kevin and Russell, they respect the heck out of each other, no question about it. They played well together, they work well together, they communicate, but I think the connection was lost a little bit for whatever reason."""
Because this is going to be an average Russell Westbrook game this year and he’s still probably gonna be an all star
"Yeah, you can't carry someone to an L.   Unless you're Russell Westbrook..."
"It's more like watch Russell Westbrook and all his athleticism and explosiveness, but more agile...far more composed, a smarter player, 3x the hangtime, and the GOAT midrange game"
"You kinda got to treat it like professional wrestling to get into it. like if you can buy into the storyline, great! It gives the games more meaning, if not, then well you’re still watching basketball which is also good.   Like I totally bought into the Russell westbrook revenge on kd mvp season storyline, but this one is just there because we exist in the same city. But either way, yay! Basketball"

"How is what you just said a “fact”, and not your personal opinion? Since Oscar Robertson averages a triple double in 1965, there have only been three times where another player has managed that feat, and it was Russell Westbrook over the last three consecutive seasons. That is what we call “a fact”.  If you want to trash whatever writers voted for it, that’s fine and I’m sure it’s somewhat justified, but it’s *an opinion*"
Way worse than what they’d be if they had to give up draft picks for Russell Westbrook.
No. Why?  1. There's James Harden 2. There's Russell Westbrook
You're just as bad as OP.   Clearly one of the most valuable players of all time and gets compared to Russell Westbrook.  Leads the league in steals twice and still gets called a bad defender by Reddit nephews.
"I don't know how I'm being downvoted, but in all seriousness I can get to 17 players definitively better that those guys.  In no particular order  West  LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Karl Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook.  East  Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, and Kyrie Irving.  I am willing to concede Kemba Walker, which makes 18.   So, that's 2 spots.  Any 2 of Blake, Butler, Beal, and Oladipo are not definitively better than Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, or Draymond Green, Kristaps Porzingis, or even Luka Doncic.  I would personally fill it out with DeRozan and Draymond because advanced stats are meaningless when you only manage to win 25 games.  OPs attempts to shoehorn in Al Horford and John Wall are peak EC stupidity."
"Because he's the only one that goes out there doing nothing but hunting for triple doubles...and where has it got him? Nowhere. That's why it doesn't mean anything....he literally avoids playing defense so he can camp in the lane for boards, and consistently passes up easy buckets for assists and gets upset at his teammates when they don't shoot it   &gt; there isn’t a case to be made that he “stat pads”  Then u are either being deliberately obtuse, u don't watch him at all, or u are just stupid. One of those 3, there's no in between. Russell Westbrook is factually the king statpadder"
"&gt; Russell westbrook, he'll be in his prime at 30 and hopefully his shot selection improves.  Even 5 years ago we were questioning that shot selection."

"&gt;Russell westbrook, he'll be in his prime at 30 and hopefully his shot selection improves."
Russell westbrook is 6’2 lol
he did do it on absolutely awful efficiency tho. Understandable but he was basically a russell westbrook that series.
"Its utterly ridiculous to suggest he hasn't done enough. An MVP is already enough, let alone two.  List of MVPs who aren't in the HOF: Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Derrick Rose, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo  List of MVPs who have qualified for the hall of fame but haven't been inducted yet:"
"They play the same offensive role, Giannis just does more playmaking.  You would be robbing them of what makes them special.  Like, DeAaron Fox and Russell Westbrook could play together, but you wouldn’t want them to."
Russell Westbrook split-the-pick-and-roll then one handed slam :(
"I can see it now.    Russell Westbrook grabs the rebound, and sprints up court, then passes to himself so it still counts as an assist, then rises to elevate over Mitchell Robinson, Robinson falls onto the floor as the and 1 is called. Westbrook beats on his chest as he stands over Robinson then gets called for a tech.    2 hours later the new top post of all time on r/nba  is someone's smart phone video where you can heat westbrook say to Robinson ""fuck them kids""   China let's the Houston Rockets back in after hearing Westbrooks opinion on children"

TOUGH question. Put me down for Kelly Oubre. I will also predict Russell Westbrook wears a skirt to a game this season. They are very in for men.

"To quote the great Russell Westbrook:  ""Why not?"""
"[Here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/) is a really good article that goes much more into the weeds about why Westbrook had the best individual season that season.  I'll also just say it's not fair to discount the impact of Westbrook's rebounding (he had the most contested rebounds per game of any player under 6'7 and averaged 1.7 offensive boards per game), and while he was less efficient than Harden as a scorer, he was also operating at a much higher volume (he scored ~6 more points per 100 possessions than Harden, won the scoring title, and was basically the only real scoring option his team had)."
Okay I'm a big critic of Russell Westbrook but god damn hes a way better player than Waiters.

"74% for Russell Westbrook in 17 is not even surprising, but still it really shows how much Russ does in his MVP season."
"This is a strength of davis not a weakness, especially because he's still an elite iso player and can create shots when he needs to. This is a strength because it means he's the best high volume non ball dominant player in the entire league outside of curry perhaps. He doesn't need the ball to score a lot very efficiently, meaning he can play alongside other elite players and still provide his full value. Compare that to Russell westbrook or harden and you'll see how their skills provide diminishing returns. Ben Taylor calls this idea portability or scalability. Being able to provide maximum value next to other stars is incredibly valuable in today's game."
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Steph Curry, Giannis A., Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Blake Griffin, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bradley Beal &amp; Kemba Walker"
"Russell has a playoff average of 19 ppg and 4 assists and 3 turnovers, at 45% TS and 34% usage, with negative win shares, VORP, BPM, etc.  Kyrie has a playoff average of 24 ppg, 5 assists, 2 turnovers, at 56% TS, and 29% usage.  5 more points a game, on two less shots a game, with better playmaking, is a huge huge upgrade.   The difference between Kyrie and D’lo is larger than the difference between Russell Westbrook and Steph Curry."
Russell Westbrook haters because they think he isn't a playmaker or a good passer.
"Curry, Harden, Lillard and Westbrook are locks barring injury. Russell will have to beat out Booker, Conley, DeRozan, Fox and McCollum.  He's not making it."
Russell Westbrook does an incredibly beautiful thing for underprivileged families on thanksgiving but sadly he can’t extend that to Christmas
Russell Westbrook Sr.
"De'Aaron Fox + Derrick Rose = Russell Westbrook  Andre Drummond + Earl Boykins = Ty Lawson  Ty Lawson + Paul Millsap = LeBron James  Larry Bird + Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Wilt Chamberlain, the 2005 Miami Heat and 1/2 of the 2011 Dallas Mavericks  = Nikola Jokic"
Russell Westbrook
"It’s crazy to think that two top 10 players in the world playing together aren’t really the talk of the league but you have to consider the context : Russell Westbrook.  If he didn’t find success with KD or PG13 on his team, it’s kind of hard to get behind the idea of pairing him with Harden and considering he’s older, that’s another drawback."
Steve Nash and Russell Westbrook are the same height. 6’3”. Russell just is explosive with his effort
If I had to boil down the essence of Russell Westbrook to one play it would be this one
I have always loved Simmons as a player and I believe he can dominate even without a jumpshot   Meanwhile I shall die  on Russell Westbrook island 🥵
"Chris Paul, John Stockton, Steve Nash, Russell Westbrook, Jason Kidd."
"Russell Westbrook. About a month ago. Not sure why, can't seem to put my finger on it."
"Russell Westbrook, I love triple doubles"

Harden and Westbrook aren’t nearly as bad as D’Angelo Russell on defense.
Russell Westbrook
If MVPs are your end all be all then Russell Westbrook is a Top 5 PG of all time
"Is this Russell Westbrook playing off the ball, cutting to the rim? I was told he doesn’t do this."
Russell Westbrook
I’m building a time machine and going to send Russell Westbrook back to 1939 for one game. How many points you think he’ll get?
The way he waves goodbye to the Russell Westbrook era in OKC is savage.
"OKC was. So in 3 of those LeBron finals appearances, they were the 3rd best team or worse.  LeBron is the most overrated player in NBA history. He’s a stat stuffer, just like Russell Westbrook."
Arenas was a force in the league? You sure you watch basketball? lmfao. Dude was basically a much worse version of Russell Westbrook.
"No I know how to get a flair, but there aren’t any with names for me, I only see teams. I have a team flair, but I want to add a player.  For example how did you get the Russell Westbrook flair"
"LMAO, Kawhi wishes he had 1/4th of the playmaking capabilities Russell Westbrook has."
Russell Westbrook in the end of the 2017-18 season has entered the chat

"&gt;The USA Basketball roster from the 2010 World Championship in Turkey boasted Derrick Rose, Eric Gordon, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry and Kevin Love.  I don't think Eric Gordon helps the argument"
Fucking russell westbrook
"Jason Kidd was—and still is—one of the greatest floor generals I've ever seen. It's interesting and difficult to compare him to guys like Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook because their games make it seem as though they're playing a different position entirely.  In terms of running a team, evoking the best out of the supporting talent provided, seeing the court, delivering the ball at just the right time to all the right players in innovative ways, and having that Larry Bird knack for seeing the play before the play before the play that's going to lead to the play, I don't think there's a single player in the modern NBA who eclipses Jason Kidd in that regard.  Ranking these guys as point guards gets weird though because while I don't think Stephen Curry has nearly the same court general mastery as Kidd, I *do* think he positively impacts the game to astronomical levels on account of the other stuff he does, largely thanks to being the greatest shooter of all-time (ex: knowing the exact right play to make when teams begin trying to take away his shot, often leading to great opportunities for teammates)."
Russell Westbrook 🤷🏿‍♂️
yeah but he also had russell westbrook on the team lol. kd had the ball a lot but it was a diff time. isolation scoring was the thing. booker is essentially the PG on phx and there's no other high usage like that on the team
"Gary Payton, Penny Hardaway, Maurice Cheeks, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, John Wall, Terry Porter. I think top 15 is out of the question. Even top 20 is a stretch"
Russell Westbrook  is not Lord of the Rings but he is all the same idea as the father of his brother who has been a great friend of mine since he died.
"&gt; Usage rating is more based on shooting attempts.   Yeah Jordan shoots the ball more often than Lebron.  &gt;LeBron can only guard the 1-3. Sometimes the 4.  Lebron has played the 4 for years. He just played the 4 last year he is considered a power forward now.  &gt;Relative to defensive dominance and impact, Jordan is the better defender. You can't even debate that.  Why not? Lebron in his prime could be put on anyone to plug a defensive hole. Everyone from Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Tony Parker to Kevin Durant and Paul Pierce to Kendrick Perkins and Al Horford. He guarded 1-5 not only in switching/help situations but also as a primary defender."
"I don't even know what you're going on with Taylor about.  Booker scores a lot of points on a bad team.  Every team needs a guy who scores.  That's been true every year for forever, and Monta Ellis put up 20 ppg on .58 TS.  Booker's better than him, but that point stands.  Using ppg and assists is not a way to measure who's better or Russell Westbrook would be GOAT right now."
Russell Westbrook is the only person I know of who is a really decent human being in real life and pretends to be an asshole to the media.
Players in this highlight  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook  Pistol Pete  Jason Williams
"Is efficiency purely an offensive metric? Sure as shooting goes, he’s elite, but just being a good shooter doesn’t make you an efficient offensive player because it doesn’t consider usage. I’ll point out two things: for having a usage rate comparable to Lebron James and Russell Westbrook, it’s detrimental to your team if you’re not making other players around you better: kyrie has never averaged more than 7 assists a game in his career.  Second, if you’re not elevating the play of others but are hogging the ball, then you better be scoring points at an elite level — he’s not. He averaged 25 points a game once in his career, which means he’s dominating the ball like a carmelo Anthony but not resulting in the offensive output for his usage rate.  If we’re considering efficiency as a measurement of how much value do you contribute to your teams performance for the amount of time you occupy the floor, then you need to consider his defense. I don’t need to say anymore to that point, but I will: kyrie is a fucking god awful defender for numerous reasons, namely effort and the fact that even if he gave two shits he’s an undersized and underskilled defender which means he’s a liability on defense."

Did you just compare John Stockton to Russell Westbrook
"**Best regular season record:** Denver Nuggets because I feel they will be the best team in the Western Conference that does not have star players resting for load management.  I predict the Clippers and Lakers will have early chemistry issues as well as resting their stars and saving energy for the post season.  The Nuggets are a young team with good chemistry that should continue their regular season success in the 2019-2020 season.  **Best regular season record in the other conference:** Philadelphia 76ers.  I think the Bucks lost valuable pieces in Brogdon and Mirotic.  I do not see Wesley Matthews filling the shoes of a 50/40/90 shooter.  The 76ers have to incorporate new pieces as well but I think defensively they will be on par with the Bucks and given Tobias Harris has had more time to learn the team's offense, I think he could be a big scorer for them at the wing position.  **Worst regular season record:**  Phoenix Suns.  This seems like a team with no direction despite having good young talent.  Could be under 20 wins again as the West has gotten so much better.  **Regular season MVP:**  Stephen Curry since he will have to carry the Warriors' offensive load in the absences of Durant and Thompson.  Russell will help out, but in trying to fill the void of 47.5 PPG, Curry could have a monster year.  My only fear with this prediction is the NBA's history of giving the award to high seeded teams.  I can't see the Warriors being higher than the 5th seed next year so we'll see how my prediction holds up.  Westbrook did win it at the 6th seed two years ago.  **Rookie of the Year:**  Zion Williamson.  Most talked about in the media, insane skillset to perform day 1 in the NBA.  **Defensive player of the Year:**  Rudy Gobert.  I think he will continue his run as DPOY since the award is usually given to a big man and I predict the Jazz to be a very successful team this year.  **Most improved:**  I'll risk sounding crazy and say Tobias Harris.  This is a player that averaged 20 PPG last season, and over 15 PPG the last 4 seasons of his career.  It's hard to believe that he could improve any more.  However, at age 27 with no more Jimmy Butler on his team and another year to learn the system, I think he could become a primary ball handler in clutch situations.  He is the best wing player on his team, I could see him having an All-Star season in the Eastern conference, and averaging close to 25 PPG.  This is my most risky prediction and I'm prepared to be completely wrong.  **6th man of the Year:**  Lou Williams.  With Kawhi and even Paul George coming off of some injury troubles, I could see Doc Rivers giving Williams a lot of minutes still.  Especially when they are blowing out teams.  I think his stats as a ""6 man"" could get inflated that way and even without the extra minutes he is the most consistent bench scorer in the NBA, I think he will get another 6MOTY award.  **Coach of the Year:**  Mike Malone to go hand in hand with my best record prediction.  The defensive energy that Malone has created around this team will flourish next season and earn him recognition his coaching.  **NBA Champions and FMVP:**  Los Angeles Clippers and Kawhi Leonard.  I think they are the most complete team in the NBA.  The 2018-2019 LA Clippers were a team of role players that beat out LeBron's Lakers to reach the 8th seed and took the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors to 6 games.  Take the important pieces to that team and add two All-NBA Forwards, arguably the two best two way players in the NBA, and I see them dominating any team in the West come playoffs.  I left out the ones I wasn't sure of.  Thanks for reading."
Idk what that means. I do know that Russell Westbrook is better for your team than Chris Paul but he is no saint and still deserves criticism.
"For reference, Russell Westbrook was 10th in MVP voting this year with 8 points out of a maximum 1010 points."
Russ is really a weird guy. He's one of those people that once you're in you're in though. Here is an in depth article on him that talks about this specific story and also a lot of his other quirks.   https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant
"lol, people from the 80s wouldn't think guys like Russell Westbrook, pre-injury Derrick Rose, D'Aaron Fox weren't even real humans. There were guys who could jump high back then, but the insane end-to-end speed, explosiveness, and balance of these guys would mind-boggle them.     There's a reason good rim defenders nowadays look like Gobert and Anthony Davis, and not robo-cop looking navy seals like Patrick Ewing and David Robinson. The speed at which these guys turn the corner and get to the rim, you can't be that heavy to make up that ground.      And then if they saw guys like Giannis and LeBron, they would be very troubled. Don't get me wrong, Jordan is a hyper athlete, but he didn't move like a dragster giving you eurosteps like these guys do."
Bronny’s favorite player is Russell Westbrook. It’s the younger so Bryce whose favorite player is Curry.
"READ IF INTERESTED IN OUTPUT: Graph 4 in the Visualizations tab shows the clusters plotted in 2 out of the 3 components used. The Cluster Means tab shows the mean shooting stats for each player type I found. Now looks at the groups specifically:  Group 4 jumps out right away as big men with no outside prowess whatsoever, like don't even dabble in the mid-range, however they have the highest % of PTS from FT's surprisingly, unsurprisingly have the highest % of PTS in the paint, mostly assisted (probably on lobs or post-ups), notables include Clint Capela, DeAndre Jordan, and interestingly Ben Simmons.  Group 6 jumps out next as the group with the highest % of 3PT attempts and % of PTS from 3PTA, they have the least amount of PTS from FT's and in the paint on average and the highest % of assisted FGM, which tells me these are shooting guards who sit around the perimeter for 3's or cuts, notables include Danny Green, JJ Redick, Kyle Korver, and interestingly Dirk.  After these, the clusters start to look a bit more alike, but we'll take Group 2, who take as many 2PT FGA as 3PT FGA and have a very balanced source of scoring, basically sitting in the middle of the pack for everything, the differentiating characteristic I think is that 84% of their 3PT shots are assisted, but 58% of their 2PT FGA's are unassisted, so I'm thinking driving wings that can shoot, probably high volume scorers too, notables include Steph Curry, Paul George, Jamal Murray, and Buddy Hield.  Group 3 strikes me off the bat as stretch 4's or centers trained to start shooting 3's (bigs like Derrick Favors or Kevon Looney), 88.5% of their shots are 2PT FGA and 66.5% of their PTS come in the paint, but 8% of their PTS come from 3's and 97.8% of those PTS are assisted, notables include Anthony Davis, Derrick Favors, Kevon Looney, Pascal Siakam, and interestingly 1 season of Andre Drummond.  Group 1 has the highest % of points from MR and the highest % of unassisted FGM (and the highest % of both unassisted 2's and 3's), so they've got to be ballhandling PG's who are pass-first and create their own shot only when the possession doesn't work out, maybe like Chris Paul or Mike Conley, notables include James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Aaron Brooks, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and Lebron James.  Group 7 is difficult to place by the numbers, 73% of their shots are 2PT attempts, a healthy amount of PTS come from MR as well as fast breaks/TO's and FT's, 59% of their 2PT FGM are unassisted and they run in transition so they've got to be wings, I'm thinking someone like DeMar DeRozan or Evan Turner, notables include Andrew Wiggins, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Brandon Ingram (only 1 season of DeMar).  Finally, Group 5 has the highest % of fast break PTS/PTS off TO's out of any cluster and is assisted on the 2nd highest % of FGM. They have a healthy balance of 3PT shots and 2PT shots but not strong FT or MR numbers. These are players I'm assuming have little desire to play offense and take shots as needed, notables include Al Horford, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Otto Porter Jr.  Looking at the cluster means tab and then trying to guess which players are in each group is a fun game for those who want to try! Would love to see people you were surprised to see in each. Remember, this is based only off shot selection, not necessarily play style. Hope you all enjoy."
Do you even watch LeBron's games? Pretty regularly when the other team is on offense and aren't crashing the boards everyone heads up court and LeBron gets the uncontested rebound. That's why LeBron has a low amount of contested rebounds. It's not Russell Westbrook bad but LeBron usually isn't boxing out to get rebounds. If AD is going hard on the rebounds LeBron's numbers will drop a pretty good amount. Or AD will give him those easy ones to keep him happy and his numbers up

Group 7 is difficult to place by the numbers, 73% of their shots are 2PT attempts, a healthy amount of PTS come from MR as well as fast breaks/TO's and FT's, 59% of their 2PT FGM are unassisted and they run in transition so they've got to be wings, I'm thinking someone like DeMar DeRozan or Evan Turner, notables include Andrew Wiggins, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Brandon Ingram (only 1 season of DeMar).  Finally, Group 5 has the highest % of fast break PTS/PTS off TO's out of any cluster and is assisted on the 2nd highest % of FGM. They have a healthy balance of 3PT shots and 2PT shots but not strong FT or MR numbers. These are players I'm assuming have little desire to play offense and take shots as needed, notables include Al Horford, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Otto Porter Jr.  Looking at the cluster means tab and then trying to guess which players are in each group is a fun game for those who want to try! Would love to see people you were surprised to see in each. Remember, this is based only off shot selection, not necessarily play style. Hope you all enjoy."
"Someone’s gonna make this thread in 20 years and say “how do players in the 2010s and 2020s not suffer major injuries” and list examples like KAT, Devin Booker, Russell Westbrook, Giannis, and other players that don’t get injured.  There were a bunch of players that got injured back then. That’s why we don’t hear about them, because their careers were cut short. Grant Hill and Yao Ming for example."
Russell Westbrook because he's one of the most fascinating human beings I've come across and there isn't a more fun player to watch when he's on.
"Hard disagree with the Rockets improving more than the Jazz. I see Russell Westbrook replacing Chris Paul on that lineup as a lateral move, not a definite improvement. We are talking about two historically ball-dominant players, and one of them is abysmal at playing off the ball. We don't yet know how it will work out. The Jazz with Mike Conley are basically getting a straight upgrade over Ricky Rubio, and with Bojan Bogdanovic we are covering our biggest weakness from last season; lack of a spread floor."
I agree age may have played a part in his sudden decline but his game was never dependent on athleticism or a quick first step like say Russell Westbrook or Derrick Rose.
Russell Westbrook is the best example

"&gt; Oscar was an animal but if his crowning achievement is something Russell Westbrook just did 3 years consecutively  It isn't. His crowning achievement is the fact that he averaged a triple double for his first 5 seasons in the league to the casuals maybe.  If you want to look at his real crowning achievement, check out how good the offences he led were with the supporting cast he had in his prime. Oscar vs Steph is a much closer debate than Magic vs Steph."
"Yeah, more popular. Dr. J defined the new direction of the NBA, athleticism and playing above the rim. Kareem was a machine.   In contemporary terms (and absolutely not comparing relative worth as players, Dr J is a legend) it's comparing Tim Duncan with Russell Westbrook; just because one is flashier doesn't mean they're more valuable but they do get more highlights on ESPN."
"I’d probably go  Magic Steph Oscar Isiah Stockton  3-5 is close but I think Magic and Steph are in their own tier. Oscar was an animal but if his crowning achievement is something Russell Westbrook just did 3 years consecutively and we don’t rank Westbrook over Steph, then why should Oscar rank over Steph either."
I wish I had the skills of Paul George and the health of Russell Westbrook
Think he was taking a shot at Russell Westbrook
"I was neutral on PG but every since he betrayed my now 2nd current favorite player, Russell Westbrook, I fucking hate him"
"LOL no one's doubling Westbrook! This is the thing about r/NBA, sometimes people say this weird ass shit that has zero basis in reality and you have to wonder, ""does this nephew not really watch the games? Is this person just making shit up? Are they purposely lying?"" Because I can't know why you're wrong, only that you are wrong.  Let me tell you how Russell Westbrook was guarded in 2019 and how he'll likely be guarded at the start of this season.   1. Nobody doubles Westbrook  2. They treat him like Draymond behind the arc. They don't sag off as much, because he's a driving threat unlike Draymond, but teams *want* him shoot the 3. He will not help spacing.   3. Go watch his highlights from last season. Like 80% of them are in transition. That's where he is elite. He's still fast, got a good handle, decent finisher and decent vision/passing (but certainly not elite)  Westbrook feels like a desperation move. James and Westbrook are both ball dominant, high usage players who are turn over prone and don't play defense. Rockets are going to be worse this season."
Ah the Russell Westbrook model
Giannis Antetokounmpo 3/1 Stephen Curry 4/1  James Harden 11/2  LeBron James 6/1  Kawhi Leonard 13/2  Anthony Davis 10/1  Joel Embiid 12/1  Paul George 12/1  Russell Westbrook 14/1  Kyrie Irving 16/1  Nikola Jokic 16/1  Karl Anthony Towns 20/1  Damian Lillard 28/1  Jimmy Butler 33/1
I think the current betting odds are a fair representation of the public perception:  -  Player | Odds ---|--- Giannis Antetokounmpo | +300 Stephen Curry | +500 James Harden | +700 Kawhi Leonard | +800 LeBron James | +900 Anthony Davis | +1000 Joel Embiid | +1200 Luka Doncic | +1600 Nikola Jokic | +1600 Karl Anthony-Towns | +2000 Damian Lillard | +2500 Paul George | +2500 Russell Westbrook | +2500 Donovan Mitchell | +3300 Kyrie Irving | +3300
"Chris Paul, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry"
"Kobe Bryant, Draymond Green, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Michael Jordan  This should be tougher. It also has two different potential answers for category, each of which has a different odd-man out."
Cameron Payne and Russell Westbrook are unstoppable together
"LeBron now? Yeah absolutely. LeBron would’ve been a different dude if he’d come up at that time though. Shit, you put PG13 or Westbrook or KD from now today in ‘75 and they win titles at will. That’s why you can’t compare across eras. Imagine Wilt or Russell or Bird or Magic or even Jordan coming up in today’s game with the nutrition and weight room advancements since their time. They’d be totally different players too."
"Russell Westbrook, Beal, Butler, Jrue"
Yeahhhh Russell Westbrook is like this too.
"Except that’s not how that works at all. Just going for the basic “oh it must work or they otherwise wouldn’t do it” is a lazy answer to try to qualifier your position. We’ve seen so many teams tank in the past and that didn’t net them a championship so why do they do it? We see Russell Westbrook shoot 6 threes a game despite being a sub 30% shooter and it’s netted him 3 straight first round exits, but because he does it, it must work right?  Basketball isn’t black and white. Players and teams do things because they *think* they’ll work, by no one can guarantee a thing. Some people also shoot better contested. Like the guy who you claimed didn’t play enough bball, I also shoot better with a hand in my face because it helps me line up my elbow better. Hell, we even see this in nba players with Jr Smith, Marcus Smart, Nick Young, Harden etc.   We can’t deny that with great shot makers, the hand in the face doesn’t bother them. Durant, Bron, Jordan, Kobe, etc. all will drill shots all day with just a hand in their face. So much more goes into defense than just melting it down to that one weird aspect."
"Just wanna say I appreciate you putting Steph, Oscar, and IT over Stockton. Many nephews here legit think Stockton is top 2 or top 3 all time, which is flat out ridiculous.   My gripe with putting Stockton ahead of the likes of CP3 and Nash is his comparably lacking talent. Don't get me wrong, Stockton's game fits the profile of the archetypal point guard: shooting, efficiency, passing, defense, playmaking, health, etc. No weaknesses to pinpoint. But he was never the game changer that CP3, Nash, and all those guys you've listed were.   Many thought CP3 was snubbed of the 2008 MVP (a season in which he led his team to a 56-26 record as a 22 year old, with David West as his all-star teammate), his competition being the likes of prime Kobe, KG, and a young LeBron James, who won MVP the following year. Think about that. Do you think Stockton is talented enough at the game of basketball to legitimately rival those inarguably top 20 players of all time, all in their primes? CP3 at that time was considered the future GOAT point guard, demonstrating an ability to dominate both with his off the charts athleticism, uncanny understanding of the game, and a precocious set of skills. If I'm trying to win a game of basketball, give me this CP3 over any season of Stockton. His decline after multiple injuries wasn't too shabby either: upon being traded to the Clippers, he would finish 3rd, 4th, 7th, 6th and 6th in MVP voting from the 2012 to '16 seasons, also delivering in the postseason (albeit with some memorable team and individual meltdowns) and aptly earning the nickname ""Point God."" You can bring up the longevity and availability arguments, but CP3 has shown enough over a good number of years that he's a top 5 point guard of all time. Also, CP3 wins the accolades argument, with 2 more 1st team all NBA selections, and 7 1st team all-defense selections compared to Stockton's 0. This disproves your claim that Stockton ""had the best defense.""   The ""most assist"" and ""closest to the finals"" arguments are not as important as you think. At the end of the day, a point guard is supposed to make plays and make the right decisions to help his team win, not to rack up assist numbers. Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for 3 consecutive seasons, but never was he considered to be the best player in the NBA. The argument about postseason success is difficult to measure because each player has a different relative amount of talent on their team. In this case, Stockton had Malone, a perennial MVP candidate type of player, which CP3 and Nash never had. David West and Amare Stoudemire (I'm not counting Dirk, bc Nash's prime was after Dallas) were fantastic players, but they were perhaps several tiers down from Malone.   I would take Steve Nash over Stockton as well. In the NBA, great offense beats great defense, and Nash was the epitome of the former. From leading his team to the number 1 offense for [9 years in a row](https://ca.nba.com/news/steve-nash-hall-of-fame-offense-impact-mvp/vy8a7wajue4a1usktriwm9xi7) , winning back to back MVPs (one of them is debatable, but still well deserved), and taking a 29 win team to a 62 win season, his prime speaks for itself. Unlike with CP3, Stockton has a clear advantage on defense when compared to Nash, but I think that gap is not so important when you consider what Nash can do for an offense.   &gt; because stockton could fly under the radar and be the 1B while cp3/nash were 1A?  First of all, Stockton was clearly a ""2"" and not a ""1B"". He is not the same level of player as Karl Malone. And second, we measure a player's worth by their ability to NOT fly under the radar. It's fine if there's no flair a la Tim Duncan, but you have to be able to positively impact the game. Stockton was certainly a huge positive force: his accolades and records speak for themselves. But talent is king, and CP3 and Nash have both shown higher highs in their ability to contribute to winning basketball."
"Did you know...the last time Christiano Felicio played in an NBA game, Russell Westbrook was on the Thunder, Kevin Durant was on the Warriors, and Kyrie Irving was on the Celtics."

"Warriors have made awful signings after giving up so much for Russell. Before Steph went down, they were still playing like shit and (luckily?) with the injuries they won’t take any heat (they’ll also keep one of their picks). Getting Russell and hardcapping themselves means no way to acquire depth. We’ll see how that Draymond contract works out, but I get giving it to him for being essentially a “day 1”. I dunno, I feel like even tho Myers was great for building the initial foundation, warriors would consider Masai if he was on the market.   As for rockets, as great as Daryl was, I’m not buying the Westbrook for CP3 thing being better for them. The controversy from HK, with the assets they’ve given up to even acquire WB are heavy man. I know rockets fans will tell me that their window is now and they don’t even use picks while they have Harden, but hemorrhaging your future like that is uh, brave."
Hello again jackass. Feel free to go through my comment history and find any evidence at all that I give a single fuck about Russell Westbrook or the Rockets. You’re a jackass because making a gesture and saying a word twice (stop lying) is not “begging.” Begging is going up to the scorers table and pleading with them for an extended period of time to give him a rebound.
Russell Westbrook this season
In high school he looked like Russell Westbrook. Now he looks like Shannon Brown.
"Naaah. James Harden, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook and Giannis all deserved it these past few years. Just because he has sustained excellence doesn't mean he was the most excellent that given year. Michael Jordan has 5 MVPs and Jerry Rice didn't lead the NFL in receiving more often than he did. He's one of the greatest. Why do people get offended when other people are getting shine other than Lebron? It's ridiculous. That's how you get backlash. Hell, just seeing this already makes me feel a certain way and I don't want to because James is great but damn."
"Yes. If it wasn't, Russell Westbrook would have 3."
"Right, but historically you need to be critical of players that put up big stats on bad teams. Guys like Kevin Love, Tyreke Evans, Russell Westbrook, etc.  I'm not saying he's a bad player or anything, just that your stats get inflated when the rest of your team sucks."

Does james harden and Russell westbrook have more than that?
"&gt;Luka Doncic finished the month averaging 32.4 PPG, 10.3 RPG &amp; 10.4 APG.   He is the 3rd player in NBA history to average a 30-point triple-double for a calendar month (min. 5 games).   He joins Russell Westbrook (2x) and Oscar Robertson (8x)."
Russell Westbrook?
"It's not likely but it has to be possible. My thought is a pointguard that combines Russell Westbrook/ Steve Nash/ Marcus Smart. Basically, take the scoring and efficiency of Steve Nash, then add the rebounding/ athleticism of a Westbrook and the defensive impact of a Smart.  If this player was on a dominant 60+ win team with numbers that look something like 18 points, 9 rebounds, 12.5 assists, 2.5 steals, 1 block with low turnovers, 50/40/90 shootings splits and elite advanced stats I think he'd be in the running. Especially if the team went into the season with limited expectations."
"Nope. Kyrie is a better one on one in an isolated world universe. As a piece to win more basketball games Kemba is a better fit in any team ever. Kyrie is an awful, beyond awful defensive player and a complete ""suck the soul out of every teammate on offense"" cancer. Russell Westbrook is the similar type just 100x the physicality and 100x less skill."
"Jordan got swept twice by the Celtics, who went to the Finals both times, winning one and losing to the Lakers. This was in the midst of both teams dominating their respective conferences and winning titles with two players in their primes. If someone wanted to scold Jordan for not winning against the Celtics as an 8 or 7th seed, in his 2nd and 3rd years, that's their prerogative, but they would be stupid to do so.  Jordan lost 3 times in a row to the Pistons before breaking through and winning every time he played a full season from then on. People tend to view persistence more favorably rather than ripping your jersey off while throwing a tantrum and then stacking the deck in your favor while proclaiming ""not one, not two, not three...""  who knew?  Russell Westbrook puts up amazing, triple double focused statlines too, nobody will ever confuse him for being a winner and leader of men. Lebron is basically Westbrook in a linebacker sized body with a lifetime of media anointment as the best player who ever lived, those who can look past these smokescreens know what they're looking at."
I think Russell Westbrook and Patrick Beverley should fight on the undercard of the Logan Paul vs. KSI Trilogy fight.
"The funny thing is Marcus does fill up a stat sheet.  He's ranked #43 by avg in 9-cat fantasy, which is better than Simmons, Horford, DeRozan, Porzingis, Russell, Middleton, Draymond, Westbrook, LouWill, LaVine, Tatum, Wiggins, and many other more prolific scorers."
"Kyrie, Harden, KD, Lebron, Cousins  Honorable Mentions - Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, Chris Paul"
"Yeah I agree, but the big haters of these players are typically pretty angry/unhappy people, and when people “circlejerk” them in positive way they don’t like it, and start to really stew in all that anger, and then unleash it all at one time the next time they get a chance.   Starts to really start a shitslinging angry war of alternating circlejerking and antijerking between the two sides because each time the other side come backs harder in response to the other side coming back harder, until it’s absolutely out of control  Best example I can think of is Russell Westbrook’s MVP year. The two sides of Harden or Westbrook would go crazy every time the other one had and the other side built off that, and it just kinda kept going back and forth and escalating to a fever pitch by the end of the year."

And the Rockets with Russell Westbrook
"I'm sorry man but you're out of your mind if you think Russell Westbrook is or ever has been a better player than Kevin Durant. If you're talking about greatness and importance to the team, yes, you could say someone like Russ is the greatest Thunder to ever play. But Kevin Durant is absolutely the best player to ever play for the Sonics/Thunder. Russ did not carry them to ""a decade of playoffs"" lol. He had a amazing statistical season after KD left and met a first round exit. Then Paul George came along to help carry the load, and they still met first round exits.  Russ is not my favorite player by any means, but I can acknowledge that he is an all time great and will revered by OKC for a long time to come. That being said, he is not and has never been better than Kevin Durant."
"KD wasn’t and won’t be the best player to wear a thunder jersey. ( yes I’m from Oklahoma and I also have no hate to KD for leaving and still like watching him play) but, Russell Westbrook is best player to play for OKC and carried the team to a decade in the playoffs without kd or harden. Also avg triple double for 3 seasons. Collision deserved the first okc retirement for his community work and his play on court. He is also on okc staff currently"
[Russell Westbrook](https://youtu.be/iyLHuVwJUkc)
&gt; Maybe Simmoms doesn't shoot because he sucks at shooting and maybe he sucks at shooting because he hasn't put in enough work.     Right but guys like Marcus Smart and Russell Westbrook have always sucked at shooting but the fact that they're even willing to shoot is much more effective than standing in the dunker spot.
"James Harden is #1 by a very wide margin. Here are others that can be arranged in any order:  * Russell Westbrook * Chris Paul * Joel Embiid * Paul George * Pat Beverly  I'm surprised people aren't as upset with Paul George considering how he signed with OKC for multiple years, tells Westbrook he's sticking with OKC at his party or whatever it was in the offseason, then forces a trade to the Clippers after only one season in OKC."
Remove Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard and put in Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid  and that's your top 5 most hated
"I want to see James Harden, Russell Westbrook, CP3, and Jimmy Butler all on the same team.   They'd all try to murder each other."

"A lot of people in the 60s thought he was the GOAT.  Regardless he was an unbelievable offensive force.  Those Royal teams were 1st in offense almost every year in the 60s basically due to Oscar.  Oscar was top 3 in TS%, top 5 in scoring, and top 2 in assists.  He basically was prime Russell Westbrook, and prime Steph Curry fused together in terms of offensive impact."

"Man, I'm one of his supporters and I cannot stop thinking about the shove. This is so above Russell. I hate it when my favorite committing such a  cheap foul. Be better next time, Westbrook."
smh people trying to defend THUG russell westbrook for attacking CLASSY GYM RAT luka doncic
The coach took Paul George and Russell Westbrook and managed two first round exits.  Expecting him to come up with something new just because personnel changed is giving him too much credit.
"Bruh how dumb are you? You said the okc schemes were built to get Westbrook a triple double. Then when I reminded you Adams still plays like that even without Russell there, you quickly changed your tune to be the coach’s fault. Ok.. maybe you just don’t know how to speak clearly and meant that the playstyle benefits Westbrook but wasn’t necessarily designed to get him his numbers. Well whether it’s the coach’s decision or Steven Adams’ to constantly box out, fact of the matter is Clint Capela is a much better rebounder.   Would you agree it’s easier to get rebounds when your center averages 9 boards versus 15 boards? Would you also agree that Westbrook would probably be averaging 9 or 10 rebounds if he didn’t have the 2nd best rebounder in the league on his team and if he had any average rebounding center instead? I love this ‘Hurr Durr, look at his numbers. SEE?!?’ argument, with no context. Dude is still averaging more boards than any other point guard in the league and he’s doing it with his center averaging 15 boards a game."
"Your first point is so off already, I could hardly read the rest.  Ben Simmons is nowhere near the athletic freak Russell Westbrook is. Is he even a top tier ""freak athlete"" in the league??? I mean he's 6'10"", has to play PG and defends it, and has no jumpshot, not even a pull-up. He's not exactly wowing peiplet with quickness &amp; hops."
Oh you mean like Russell Westbrook?
As long as we get a lottery pick and nobody not named Russell Westbrook averages a triple double I’ll be happy.
"There's a big difference between ""just a decent point guard"" and ""going to take you over the top."" Russell Westbrook, for example, sits in that category. I'm not saying Conley is Westbrook, I'm saying there's a lot of room for good but not great PGs."
*Russell Westbrook has left the chat.*
the russell westbrook experience
Russell Westbrook vs. Efficiency
You know what's truly scary? Imagine Russell Westbrook in a Thunder jersey
This is one of those comments that people reference later on the season that I always I think are  made up.   “Russell Westbrook 35/11/12 tonight”  /u/randomguy24- “Remember when people in this sub said that FVV was the better player and Westbrook shouldn’t be in the league”   Me: “who tf actually said that?”  Now I know
Russell Westbrook shooting 23% for the season. Oh good heavens that is even worse than I thought it would be. And he's starting to chuck even more now that Harden is getting defended more aggressively.   What an absolute disaster. And this is just his first year in Houston as he continues to age and his game declines.
Russell Westbrook is also one of the worst players of all time.
&gt;The number 1 defensive guard is Russell Westbrook  I sleep 😴  &gt;The number 5 defensive wing is Moe Harkless  𝓡𝓮𝓪𝓵 𝓢𝓱𝓲𝓽 👌😂👌😂👌😂
"I'm sorry I just don't agree at all. Being the clear cut best player on  the winningest team can be part of the narrative. Being on a stacked squad or repeating takes away the glitz of that storyline.   Derrick Rose, Lebron James, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Giannis...all of these guys had a story that people wanted to buy into over the other players."
Lmaooooo your stat really has James Harden and Russell Westbrook as the two best defenders in the league. That tells you how useful your stat is.
"probably because of shit like this to where if you like actually watched him then you would see that he wasn't contesting shots because he was too worried about grabbing the rebound.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2017/04/05/russell-westbrooks-triple-double-domination-is-not-as-impressive-as-it-seems/  &gt; Westbrook contests 3.6 shots per game, the lowest rate of any player averaging at least 30 minutes per night. The players he guards attempt eight field goals per game, per Synergy Sports, which means they take more than half of their shots without any sort of defensive effort on Westbrook’s part despite him being the closest defender. Even his attempts to contest shots does little good: Opponents have a better field goal percentage on shots he defends (48.6 percent) than on all of their other field goal attempts"
Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double for 3 consecutive seasons  Luka Doncic has been in the league for 88 games  Let's hold our horses a bit
"&gt; Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, and Nate Archibald  scrubs"
Thanks! I’ll take a look at some of those at a more sociable hour when I get a chance. Just watched the Patrick Beverley v Russell Westbrook beef on SBNation to get a feel for it and that was pretty good and informative. Appreciate the shout.
"No, we have to massively overreact every time a player does anything good or bad, otherwise it’s not /r/nba anymore. In other news: Russell Westbrook is the worst player in NBA history."
"What does that have anything to do with what I said?  Last year, the guards could shoot. This year, they have russell westbrook.  As long as westbrook is on the floor, he's going to be a liability and harden is going to get doubled.  Gordon coming back doesn't do anything about westbrook being a complete liability."
"I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"

SCARY Russell Westbrook pushes NICE and HARD WORKER Luka!!
when was the last time u watched russell westbrook play basketball  or eric gordon  lol
fuck russell westbrook
Harden's usage was higher than Russell as well. He had almost double the amount of turnovers than Westbrook too.
Russell Westbrook missed two huge fastbreak layups against the Clips and now he's missed a couple open ones today. He needs to get the buckets he should be getting
Watching Russell Westbrook is exactly how I feel when watching Eric Bledsoe.
"James Harden will not start the 4th Q. His first rest since the first quarter. Another stint for the Russell Westbrook led second-unit, but with House and Capela alongside him."
"I haven't seen too much of Russell Westbrook this season, but the small amount of games I've seen him play he appears to really struggling finish around the rim, which was one of the things he was really good at.   He looks like a liability out there."
"Russell ""stuck between two minds"" Westbrook lol"
&gt; kinda Russell Westbrook levels of good.  this means something different to everyone in r/nba
Imagine being scared of Russell Westbrook in the playoffs.
"There has never been a better basketball player with a worse basketball IQ  than Russell Westbrook. Incredible player and athlete, but just makes so many boneheaded decisions."
Yeah kemba wasn’t a lock with Russell Westbrook  and Stephen Curry taking up 2 spots while also not playing as good as Beal is currently.
"I don't think he's that similar to Westbrook. He's more skilled, I don't think Russ has the finesse to make a shot like this. Russell has more power in his step though."
"Because Chris Paul is a winner and Russell Westbrook is not.   One of these guys runs a team, the other one only cares about his teammates when they’re filling up his assist column."
Russell Westbrook has the potential to be a good shooter but he cant shoot
"who’s the biggest thunder killer, kcp, andrew wiggins or russell westbrook?"
"im going to keep saying this people, RUSSELL WESTBROOK DOES NOT PLAY WINNING BASKETBALL"
"I know. Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double for the last 3 years, in the modern day nba. If that’s washed up, then everyone else is washed up"
"Karl ""Russell Westbrook"" Anthony Towns...that was such a bad shit lmao"
Russell Westbrook is the single most overrated player in basketball
"he's legit throwing pinpoint lobs. his vision is absolutely insane. If you havent already, i'd recommend checking out the piece KOC wrote that mentions bam. [Here it is ](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/11/22/20977125/russell-westbrook-pascal-siakam-ben-simmons-coward)"
"They are a very different team this year. They used to have Russell Westbrook (he’s on the rockets now) and Now they are in a rebuild. They have Chris Paul who is one of the best point guards ever but he’s getting old and declining a bit now. I don’t know how much you know about the players but they drafted Keving Durant, Russel Westbrook, and James Harden. All three are phenomenal players. They chose to trade Harden (which turned out to be a terrible idea) and Kevin Durant left to join the warriors (which is why a lot of people hate him on here).  If you have any specific questions about the team or any other teams/player or just about basketball in general I’d be happy to answer you."
Did Russell Westbrook get erased from the timeline
"[Here is the story from when that happened:](https://www.sbnation.com/2019/3/12/18261550/russell-westbrook-jazz-fan-video-story-utah)  &gt; Westbrook didn’t take any questions after the game. Instead, he addressed his altercation with the pair of Jazz fans. He said one told him to “get on your knees like you’re used to,” then said his wife repeated the same statement."
"[Yep:](https://www.sbnation.com/2019/3/12/18261550/russell-westbrook-jazz-fan-video-story-utah)  &gt; Westbrook] didn’t take any questions after the game. Instead, he addressed his altercation with the pair of Jazz fans. He said one told him to “get on your knees like you’re used to,” then said his wife repeated the same statement."
Just to be clear you are saying that kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook aren't in the same caliber as Pau Gasol? You realize he wasnt drafted a rocket right? like how long have you been watching basketball?
"But was he wrong? Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for the second season in a row. To get it, the last game he needed something like 12 rebounds. He got something like 18. That's just not normal. He purposefully went for it."
"Well yeah, he was kind of playing with Russell Westbrook, who took a bunch of pressure off of him. Again, KD is the best scorer of the last decade, there’s really no debating that, but Harden this season is also incredible right now. "
"&gt;There is not much you can do after someone mimes the act of rocking your little infant self to sleep. The sole recourse is to put your head down, get through life, and eventually grow old enough to where you can comfortably start a family of your own. At that point, you will learn the responsibility that comes with having a child. Getting it to sleep is but one chore. You also have to feed, clothe, teach, and guide it through this complicated and often scary world. Only then will you truly understand the work that goes into child-rearing.

Russell “rock the “this is your fault” baby” Westbrook is underrated when it comes to petty trashtalk 
"Steven Adams, Russell Westbrook, Draymond Green, Zaza Pachulia."
"You know what I want to see? Big man volleyball.  &amp;#x200B;  Let's get Nurkic, Jokic, Gobert, Adams, AD, Giannis, Embiid, Hassan Whiteside (for the blocks), JaVale, Myles Turner, Serge Ibaka, Jarrett Allen, Drummond or Blake, and KAT and get some 6v6 volleyball going (with a couple of subs for the inevitable injury).  &amp;#x200B;  Maybe throw in a couple of liberos (I nominate De'Aaron Fox and Russell Westbrook) just so we don't have really tall dudes diving everywhere."

Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook 
"Wait, not Russell Westbrook?"
"Oh I agree with that, but the point that his contemporaries still considered Russell the better player.   A modern Comp would be Westbrook and Steph. In thirty years kids who didn’t watch will ask why Steph was considered better when Russ was averaging triple doubles.   Just like Wilt and Bill both players are great but ones on a loaded winning team and another is individually doing crazy things to stat sheets. "
Then the Kings actually would be pretty close to having the next Russell Westbrook and Durant.

"Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure. Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play. That white dude is a man by the name of Luca Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luca Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luca Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luca does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luca Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero"

The game that really made people sit up and take notice that he is **superstar** material was Game 4 of the NBA finals, where Russ put up 43 points against Lebron James and the Heat.

"Russell ""I don't dunk anymore but I'll lay it up on your ass"" Westbrook :/"
"He's played on a lot of good teams. He's played with some great players and he is part of the problem when they're in their toughest games. Yes, durant is a great point since he pushed a better player off of the team. George is better at scoring than him. It is odd that Oladipo also happens to get a lot better when he is away from Russell.    He's a selfish great player that plays himself out of great games. He's also a stat stuffer. Those are facts about Westbrook. People need to just accept it. "
&gt;Tha hell? 😂 So *defense* outplayed russell Westbrook AND Paul George in a series?  Why are you asking as if defense wasn't the reason OKC lost? The games OKC won were the games Gobert played the least. Mitchell outplayed OKC *because* of Gobert's defense.
"As Russell Westbrook finished his warmup for the Warriors game, GS Small Forward Kevin Durant was on the sideline watching and waiting. When Durant saw Westbrook finish, he started walking towards him. Russ saw Durant and sped up, running away to the Thunder locker room as Durant yelled “Hardest road! This has been tough!” with his rings out."
"Tha hell? 😂 So *defense* outplayed russell Westbrook AND Paul George in a series? Defense don’t  get buckets   Also ‘volume shooter’ is a lazy term and a red flag for a casual fan. Unless you’re Lebron, KD, or Steph, almost EVERYBODY is a ‘volume shooter’. Names Harden is shooting about 43%. Is he just a volume shooter? Bad take "
"Chris Paul is easily Top 50, Russell Westbrook should be there as well"

Muh triple double!! Then the playofffs comes and Russell westbrook sucks
"Nooo I’m obviously talking about percentages bc Russell Westbrook has the worst percentage for a high volume shooter so I chose him as the example. And I started this conversation so you can’t tell me what I meant lol. You’re trying to make this about shot form, which Westbrook’s is superior to Lonzo’s, but Lonzo shoots 10% better so it doesn’t even matter. "
Trae is 6’2. That’s one inch shorter than guards like Damian Lillard Steph Curry Russell Westbrook and taller than guys like CP3 and Kyrie Irving. Trae has been the 3rd best rookie this season I don’t get why you’re so negative. Luka is farther along in his development so of course he looks better now. For all we know this could be his ceiling and you’re using words like fleeced. Fuck outta here. Give me another year of Trae and let me see what we do with that pick before we talk about fleeced.

Ask Russell Westbrook 
-Russell Westbrook
Well Russell Westbrook isn’t really a “3PT shooter” like those other guys
Stat stuffer isn't a bad thing lol. You need to spend less time around people who hate Russell Westbrook.
"I think people on this thread are confusing (at least with how I define it) passing and creation or playmaking. Lonzo isn't the best pick and roll player, not because he can't make the passes, but because he's a miserable scoring threat. He doesn't get the assists of De'Aaron Fox or Russell Westbrook because he cannot collapse the defense, not because he's a worse passer.  Lonzo is a transcendent passer, but he lacks the connecting skills as a scorer for his passing to shine through consistently. Even then, he makes great quick reads and hit ahead passes that very few others can make."
"k listen up you little shit  I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
Dawg let’s go inside the mind of a Russell Westbrook - *drrrrrrrrrrrrrrp*  “Dawg I gotta do this shit. I put da team on my fuckin back doe.”
"Traditional PG (That means no LeBron, Doncic, Simmons) I would want right now and would trust to best a starting caliber PG:  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Damian Lillard  Kemba Walker   Kyle Lowry   Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook  Mike Conley  John Wall  &amp;nbsp;   Jamal Murray  De'Aaron Fox  Eric Bledsoe  Goran Dragic  Spencer Dinwinddie   Lou Williams  D'Angelo Russell  Ricky Rubio  Reggie Jackson   Jeremy Lin  &amp;nbsp;  Terry Rozier  George Hill  Derrick Rose  Darren Collison   Lonzo Ball  Patty Mills  Tyus Jones  Jeff Teague   Rajon Rondo  &amp;nbsp;  Guys that're playing well but are still proving themselves: SGA, Van Vleet, Payton, Tomas Satoransky, CoJo // Mudiay, Kris Dunn, Derrick White &amp; Dennis Smith Jr. (Less Proven)  The rest of the PGs imo are just about the same level, and are more a  better of fit, and they're hundreds of guys in about the same level such as Shane Larkin and now Brad Wanamaker on the Celtics.   "
The OG Russell Westbrook
That Russell Westbrook is the worst PG of all time
"top player tiers  1: lebron  2: steph curry, kevin durant  3: james harden, kawhi leonard, anthony davis, giannis antetokounmpo   4: nikola jokic, joel embiid, paul george, kyrie irving, russell westbrook"
Russell Westbrook is INSANE
I really do appreciate having Russell Westbrook on my team. He's phenomenal.

" I think these are the locks:   James Harden  Damien Lillard  Paul George  Kevin Durant  Anthony Davis  Steph Curry  Russell Westbrook  LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  &amp;#x200B;  That leaves 3 spots. A FC spot and two Wild Cards. I think it's going to come down to him, KAT, Booker, Doncic (who might make it as a starter), which would remove one of the WC spots from these locks), Conley, Klay, Marc Gasol, Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday, his teammate DeMar, and Tobias Harris.   Just looking at that list, I think he probably has a good shot to make it, especially with how he's been playing as of late. I think KAT, Booker and Klay are his biggest competition, and he has a good case against them. I'd give him \~55% chance of making the team in the West. "

Big fan of this new defensive Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is second to only Lebron when he’s playing smart don’t @ me muh fuckas
Who's Russell Westbrook?
He’s got 20 assists. Who ever said Russell “Triple Double” Westbrook doesn’t pass?
Russell Westbrook just made the smart play. Crazy things happening tonight
Because his name is Russell Westbrook.
Irony?  Westbrook was criticized for not putting his teammates in great positions and for shooting a high volume on low efficiency.   [Compare Harden's numbers this year to Westbrook's in his MVP season.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id1_select=James+Harden&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=hardeja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y2=2017&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players)   Harden is scoring more with far better eFG% and TS%.
OKC's defense should rip apart a team with bad spacing but they do also have Russell Westbrook playing so that should even things out.
"You can point to significant differences between James Harden and his competition in his individual performance. That being said, I don't think you could do that with James Harden and Russell Westbrook when Harden finished second to him, they were very close but Westbrook exceeded the arbitrary trible double line. Really, he had about two more rebounds per game "

Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Paul George  Kevin Durant  Steven Adams  Pretty damn good considering we have only been around for about 10 years
Russell Westbrook has more More FGA than Collins though. Westbrook has been playing Moreyball this whole time and we just didn't see it!
"I mean we're all people. We like and hate things for our own reasons. It's those loud fat guys that, like Chuck said on TNT, sit in their mom's basement all day with cookie crumbs on their stomach that are the exhausting ones. Being a fan of Russell Westbrook, for some reason, is so different than being a fan of Curry or LeBron in my opinion. Idk why lol, but whatever, it's just sports."
I love Russell Westbrook. The dude plays with passion every game. I don't care if he pads rebounds or hi ts% sucks because when he's having a good game there aren't many more players in the league capable of being more entertaining to watch.
"&gt;He said RW has excess of about a half dozen jumpers a game(be it unnecessary 3 or awful pull up long 2s) that are just totally unnecessary and ill advised. There is almost no situation in which OKC is optimizing their offense when he takes those.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23364202/zach-lowe-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba  The thing that stood out to me the most was the [video of him not doing a stepback, but little dribbling backwards](http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/3Q_G6_601_551_2GIF.mp4) into a 3!"
"This is rather remarkable irony. OKC drafted themselves into James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and Serge Ibaka. Then managed to squander it all with 10 years of shitty coaches from Scott Brooks to Billy Donovan. 2016 was OKC's pinnacle of underachievement due to awful coaching."
"Good list... however..   There are only 2 other people on this list this season (Trey Lyles with 128 attempts at 25% (1.5% better) and Stanley Johnson with 140 attempts at 26.4% (2.9% better)).  Russell Westbrook, so far, has 153 attempts (25 more than Trey Lyles and 13 attempts more than Stanley Johnson). He would have to be on a hot streak from 3s to reach those guys.   The most attempts on that list is Antonie Walker with 285 attempts. However, he shot 25.6% that season (2.1% better than Westbrook this season). If Westbrook shoots the same rate he is going right now, he's going to obliterate that attempts at 360 to 390 attempts for the season. At the rate Westbrook is going now.. he'd be lucky to make 100 3s with that many attempts.. (25.6% - 27.7%)   If he did shoot 360 3s attempts (please no), he'd need to make 107 3s to reach his last season's average of 29.8%.   Please... no more 3s from westbrook. "

Russell Westbrook and Brett Favre. Both are former MVPs with irrational confidence to try to make every pass and therefore throw a lot of picks/turnovers but also crazy playmakers.
"Russell ""IDGAF"" Westbrook!"
"No idea but it was weird. ESPN has this in the play by play ""Russell Westbrook steps out of bounds turnover"" but that doesn't really make sense when PG had the ball."
"Westbrook, Russell"
"Lmao a Sixers fan how typical, should have probably checked tonights box score before you left this stupid comment. 19 games in a row Russell Westbrook has beaten your garbage team I don't blame you for being upset."

Can Newton - Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook and Cam Newton
"You watch the game, you don't see Westbrook. You watch Russell Westbrook, you see the whole game - Vicente Del Bosque, probably"
"Someone that paid money to come watch the game but can't watch the game because Russell Westbrook is blocking her view. Call me crazy, but this is most certainly not some outlandish request. Westbrook is a complete asshole. I don't understand why people enjoy that kind of behavior and attitude."
[Serious] Has Russell Westbrook lost a step?
"Jrue Holiday has never been a 20/10 guy. The only guys to do it in the last 20 years are Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Deron Williams, and John Wall. If you actually think that’s Trae’s ceiling, that’s not a great comparison."
Only Russell Westbrook and Lonzo Ball can take advantage of that.
"&gt; A Designated Player coming off his rookie contract may be eligible to earn 30% of the salary cap (rather than the standard 25%) if he passes certain criteria. Through the 2017–18 season, in order to be eligible, the player must be voted to start in two All-Star Games, or be named to an All-NBA Team twice (at any level), or be named MVP. Officially titled the ""5th Year 30% Max Criteria"",[33] it has been dubbed (and is more commonly known as) the ""Derrick Rose Rule"" after the 2011 MVP,[34] due to the fact that when the criteria were introduced, Rose was the only player in the NBA eligible to sign the maximum extension (due to his MVP award).[35]   &gt; The reasoning for the rule is to suitably reward players being extended off of their rookie contract who are considered to be of a higher ""caliber"" than their peers, without restricting them to the lower (25%) salary level.[36] A player may sign a ""5th Year, 30% Max"" contract before the final year of his rookie contract and before fulfilling the criteria needed to receive the 30% salary grade. Should the player fail to fulfill the criteria before the start of his Designated Player contract, he will receive the standard five-year, 25% Designated Player contract. James Harden of the Houston Rockets and Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans had such a clause in their contract extensions, but both failed to meet the criteria.[37] The only player in the NBA who was attempting to qualify for a full 30% contract in 2013–14 was Paul George, who signed a provisional 30%/5 year contract in September 2013. George, who had made the All-NBA third team in 2012–13,[38] qualified by again making the All-NBA third team.[39]  &gt; The 2017 CBA changed the qualification criteria for ""5th Year, 30% Max"" contracts. Players who come off rookie contracts at the end of the 2017–18 season, or later, must meet any of the following criteria to qualify:[40]  &gt; Selection to an All-NBA team (at any level) in the player's fourth season, or in two of the three seasons between his second and fourth seasons.  &gt; Selection as Defensive Player of the Year in the player's fourth season, or in two of the three seasons between his second and fourth seasons.  &gt; Selection as MVP in any season from the player's second onward. These criteria are identical to those for the veteran player extensions introduced in the 2017 CBA. Had these criteria been part of the 2011 CBA, Rose would still have qualified for a 30% contract, as he was in his third NBA season when he was named MVP.  5/30 contracts: 5/30% Contracts The following players have signed 5 year/30% contracts:[33]  Derrick Rose (signed with the Chicago Bulls; was later traded to the New York Knicks during the last year on that deal) until 2017 (qualified by winning the 2011 MVP award) [41] Blake Griffin (signed with the L.A. Clippers; was later traded to the Detroit Pistons in 2018) signed through 2018 (qualified by making the All-NBA second team in 2011–12 and 2012–13) Paul George (signed with Indiana Pacers; since has been traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder) signed until 2019 (qualified by making the All-NBA third team in 2012–13 and 2013–14)[38][39] Karl-Anthony Towns (signed with Minnesota Timberwolves) through 2024 (qualified by making the All-NBA third team in 2017–18)[42]  5/25% contracts: Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers) until 2023 Russell Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder) until 2017 Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans) until 2021 John Wall (Washington Wizards) until 2019[43] James Harden (Houston Rockets) until 2018 Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) until 2020 Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers) until 2021  [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap#%22Derrick_Rose%22_Rule)"
Stopped reading after Russell Westbrook lol
"You can't always improve or develop new skills though, that's a common misconception. Like if someone is a poor shooter, people always just say ""he'll just work on his shot and become a good shooter"" but there's more to that than just work ethic. You have to have some natural aptitude for it as well. Look at Russell Westbrook for instance: his whole game is predicated on his explosive athleticism, and as it is slowly starting to decline it's made him *much* easier to guard because he doesn't have a reliable shot to fall back on. You need to have ""an old man game"" to be successful as an old man (like Vince Carter). If you just rely on your athleticism, then when that goes your career can be over quick (see Allen Iverson or Melo)."
&gt;PG: Russell Westbrook  
Russell Westbrook  You're funny.
"I'm sorry, but I don't see this. Russell Westbrook is probably the fourth or fifth largest star in the league behind LeBron, Curry and Durant. You could probably name another name or so. But Westbrook has been in Oklahoma his entire career. Ask Jordan or Mountain Dew if being in Oklahoma restricts Russ. Spoiler alert: It doesn't. "
PG has Russell Westbrook on his team lol
"deangelo russell, kemba walker, russell westbrook, john wall, kyrie Irving all started as, and some still are, ball dominant and note quite efficient lead guards smh As far as wings, 3 of the best of this entire generation have at various points been deemed ""ball dominant"": Lebron, Harden, to a lesser extent KD    So just a heads up, its no coincidence that the term 'ball dominant' tends to coincide with guys who deserve and demand the ball. Unless you're Steph, Klay, how many stars are NOT ball dominant!? lol  But like i said, i know what fans tend to go for ! Holla at me come playoffs!"
"And Russell Westbrook is one of the worst players in the NBA according to TS%, so many people take one or two stats and use that to justify their opinions. Advanced stats are a great way to have a different perspective, but its not the only way. But, I would agree that Siakam is significantly better than Kuzma. "
"The LA narrative is so fucking overdone.   Kawhi is from LA so he wants to be a Laker!  Klay has LA ties so he wants to be a Laker!  Russell Westbrook went to UCLA so he wants to be a Laker!  Paul George is from LA so he wants to be a Laker!  Anthony Davis wants to win so he wants to be a Laker!  These players don't give a fuck about the city. They're competitors. As long as a team can compete they're happy. Davis wants to leave NOLA because he wants to win, not because he enjoys 80 degree weather and In N Out in LA."
"&gt;Russell Westbrook's 3P% has also improved over the last 12 but it's still horrible so I'm not going to say it lol  Westbrook is giving up much of his game in these last weeks to help his teammates put up those numbers. I think he changed his style to get George and the other Guys going and i hope at least his teammates appreciate it, because u aren't at all."
"You're comparing the best shooter of all-time to Russell Westbrook.   To not acknowledge real life impacting players on the court is silly... And you only read half of it... Russ was in OKC, his family in LA. "
LeBron did the exact same thing.... to another shitty city and franchise. How are you disproving my point?  You’re also refusing to acknowledge the fact that you can’t win a championship with Russell Westbrook as a #1 option.... he’s a 2nd tier superstar..... one of my absolute favorite players in the league but I can be realistic about his ability. 
"MVP winner Russell Westbrook decided to stay long term. Same with MVP candidate Paul George. So, I guess agree to disagree. Also LeBron did the basically the exact same thing, so not a great argument there.  But it’s ok, be sure to tune into some Thunder games this year!"
What has Russell Westbrook ever done to make you think he's capable of adapting the way he shoots the ball
I mean Russell Westbrook is really obviously one of the best offensive players of his generation. Not really sure why it would be controversial. OKC routinely had an elite offense starting 0s and their offense dropped off more without Westbrook than without Durant.
said the same shit last season when harden won MVP and the media acted like russell didnt average a triple double for the 2nd time in a row!! when the first year he averaged a triple double that was the sole reason westbrook won MVP over harden

Now that Russ has averaged it 3 years in a row it doesn't feel like it is crazy.  But for the 55 years that it went unbroken the record seemed impossible **especially** when you consider Oscar did it at a pace that is far higher than that of todays NBA pace.
"&gt; Also, the Supersonics with KEVIN DURANT and RUSSELL WESTBROOK couldn't sell enough tickets to sustain a market in Seattle; how do you think that would go now that the team they'd be getting has no player or prospect on the level of either??  There are so many things wrong with this I don't even know where to begin.  First off, Westbrook never played in Seattle and Durant only played his rookie season.  The move from Seattle to OKC had nothing to do with ticket sales.  An Oklahoma City businessman bought the team with the intention of moving the team to his hometown even though he agreed to a ""good faith"" effort to keep the team in Seattle as part of the sale.  His ""effort"" consisted of demanding a fully taxpayer-funded stadium in a suburb nowhere near downtown, and then illegally demanding that the city let him out of his current lease with the downtown arena to move the team.  "

*Sigh* This convo again. Russ' MVP season was absolutely ridiculous and that's why he won it.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/
"He controls the ball almost all of their plays in today's game which is extremely fast paced which means more possessions and opportunities to get assists and rebound, rules have been changed over the years to hinder defensive capabilities and strengthen offense which leads to much more success on offense, etc. The game is watered down. It's not like triple doubles have much meaning anymore. It's kind of just like whatever in today's league. When I was growing up they were regarded super highly because they were rare and quite a feat to achieve and now it's just whatever for a player to get one ever 2 to 3 games or nearly every game like Westbrook. So yeah, let's not get crazy.   &gt; Are we overlooking the epic greatness of what Russell Westbrook is doing as an individual...?  It's just not that epic in today's game. "
Russell Westbrook. Everyone shits on him like he isn't a star.
"How? There's so much more to being a quality teammate than 1 player's statline. How about Oladipo's statline since leaving OKC? Or Durant's? Or Sabonis'? Or Harden's? Why isn't this tied to Alex Abrines' quality as a teammate? PG is also 28, which is around when guys typically have their career best years anyway.  NONE of that is me undermining Russell Westbrook. I'm just not tryna insert some unrelated circlejerk into an interesting post just to be edgy."
"A good point. I suppose the same ethics for choosing a team would apply to choosing a player. For example, if you rocked a Russell Westbrook flair during his MVP year, you best not be switching to James Harden this year because Russ is having a bad shooting year (still amazing in all other areas)."

Here's an excerpt from an article:      ""Fellow ""founding fathers"" Russell Westbrook and Nick Collison had met with Durant prior to that, having dinner with him. They tried to reinforce how important staying together is, how they are on the verge of something truly special. Westbrook largely led the charge.  The Thunder had hoped they could sway Durant to drop his planned meetings in the Hamptons and agree long term on the spot. They came armed with the idea of chasing big man Al Horford, believing if Durant would commit, they could be on the phone with Horford and his agent at midnight to start lining up a deal. Presti knew the Thunder weren't landing Horford without Durant standing by his side; and he feared the opposite. Durant was unwilling."""

"So it's ""the three point era and Russell westbrook is averaging a triple double"""
Russell Westbrook has done a great thing. He's exposed how overrated triple doubles are.
"The Thunder are 97-23 (.808) when Russell Westbrook records a triple-double. If “stat-padding” helps wins games, then the Thunder sure don’t mind, and neither do I. "
"Over a span of 5 seasons Oscar Robertson averaged a 30 point triple-double while having a TS% that was about 8 or 9% over the league average. One of those seasons he led the league in TS%.  For reference Bird's TS% was about 6 or 7% above the league average at the time.  Oscar Robertson really gets overshadowed by Wilt and Russell, but the numbers Oscar Robertson was putting up were also crazy. As impressive as Westbrook has been, Oscar did it for a lot longer and was also one of the most efficient scorers at the time as well."
I like how to /r/nba triple doubles only matter when someone other than Russell Westbrook gets them. 
"He just wanted to sing praises to Russell because is what players do to each other these days.  The statement is completely ridiculous though. Then why Oladipo didnt show those improvements during the season? Oladipo averaged 13/4/3 with 38%FG in the last month of RS with OKC.  In the PO he averaged 11/5/2 shooting 34% from the field.  Did he watch Russ prepare for the games the whole season but really didnt understood it until he was already in the Pacers or what?  Seriously, that just sounds like you want to give Westbrook credit for making better another player (Pacers' Oladipo) that isnt even in his own team."
"Hey man, I'm a Russell Westbrook fan, I don't give a fuck about shooting percentages. Also, fuck KD."
"&gt; Okay, I'm going to break this down in a very simple statement to go directly around your flawed argument.   So essentially.  ""I'm going to avoid 99% of your argument because I don't have an adequate response.""  &gt; There are 30ish starting point guards in the league right now, regardless of who you *think* ""deserves"" to be a starter.   The following teams are probably good with their PG situation (22 teams),  HOU (Paul), GS (Curry), POR (Lillard), CHA (Kemba), BOS (Kyrie), OKC (Westbrook/Schroder), NO (Jrue), MEM (Conley), BKM (Russell), DEN (Murray), SAC (Fox), PHI (Simmons), ATL (Young), MIL (Bledsoe), TOR (Lowry), UTAH (Rubio), LAL (Lonzo/Rondo), SA (White), WSH (Wall), MIA (Dragic), CLE (Sexton), MIN (Teague).  The following are most likely looking for new options (8 teams),  ORL (DJ), PHX (I don't even know), CHI (Dunn), NY (Mudiay), DAL (DSJ), LAC (SGA), IND (Collison), DET (Jackson).  I'm just going based off how fans probably feel about their starting PG (if they're being realistic).  So 8 teams probably don't feel like they have solid starting PG's.  Are they ""starting""? Yes. Are they what the team wants in that spot? Probably not.  So I guess instead of using the word ""deserves"", you could use the phrase ""desirable situation by the team"".  &gt; Saying what you said is implying directly that you believe all of them are playing better than he is this year. Which is hilarious.   There's tons of PG's that teams can count on to run the point well (which is something Rose just doesn't do well unfortunately, even this year) and can give them 35-40 minutes a night and can play the majority of the season. This is a point I've said a few times now and you have even said yourself that his body can't hold up.  &gt; And btw, I'm not a ""rose fan"" I guess you missed my flair.   So you're only a David Robinson fan? Why are you still watching the NBA?  &amp;#x200B;  Like I said multiple times, Rose is doing a good job being a sixth man where his main focus is on scoring off the bench. You can't count on him to give you 35-40 minutes a night and you can't count on him to run an offense consistently.  I don't get how this is offending you so much? It's not like I'm saying he's playing like garbage this year?"

**Starters**  * James Harden * Steph Curry * Kevin Durant * Lebron James * Paul George  **”Locks”**   * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic * Damian Lillard  You need to pick 4 of these guys to fill out the all star roster  * Rudy Gobert * Karl-Anthony Towns * Russell Westbrook * LaMarcus Aldridge * Mike Conley * Jrue Holiday * Luka Doncic * Danilo Gallinari * Tobias Harris * DeMar DeRozan * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Klay Thompson  I think LMA will get in but a lot of competition.

He's also playing with Russell Westbrook and Paul George 
"Russell Westbrook is severely overrated, people will look back on his career and see him as a checker. There will be discussions if he even deserved him MVP because he was just stat chasing"
"LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard all certainly deserve it over him. Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, Tobias Harris, and Karl Towns all have legitimate arguments over him as well.  Like it or not, team record does matter for being selected to the all star game."
"Russell Westbrook did not win an MVP solely because of his triple double average like people on here often claim. He averaged one for virtually all of the 16/17 season yet Harden was the favourite for the majority of the time. He won because he was percieved as being more clutch than Harden down the stretch of the year and because he was thought to be carrying a garbage team on his back. Whether or not you agree with that is up to you, but the idea that he won purely because of an arbitrary stat line is a falsehood. "

Good stats I'll give you James Harden 5.4 tov Russell Westbrook tov 4.5
&gt;Monta Ellis is better than Russell Westbrook    Oh hell no lmaoooo
All you here about is James Harden I'm going to point out his field goal percentage is .438 Westbrook's is .418. James Harden is a liability on defense Westbrook is rated as the best defender at the guard position. Russell Westbrook is leading NBA in assists and steals he is also averaging a triple double for the third straight season. The Thunder are the 3rd seed and the Rockets are the 5 seed. I need someone to explain how Or why the media is ignoring Russell Westbrook.
"Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure.   Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play. That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luka Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luka Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luka does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luka Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero. "
"&gt;I don’t understand anyone who says Giannis is, like do y’all even watch the games?  Do you?  &gt;Its like Russell Westbrook in 2017 vs James Harden, sure they both were playing well, but Russell was doing it on a way worse team.  Yeah, Harden should have won that. Both the Bucks and those Rockets performed much better than everyone expected and suddenly people act like Harden and Giannis had some superteam carrying them."
"True that. Not a Russell Westbrook hater but the fact is he is ball dominant as all hell. Granted he’s a great player, but you have to build around him. He’s not a player you can just add to your team and have an instant upgrade (why he and Durant never won). "
And lose almost every time. Russell would shut him down in 4th quarters. Wilt was an athletic freak yet was also one of the biggest athletic disappointments in history. Wilt was ten times the stat chaser that Westbrook is and shrank in clutch time. He won just 2 rings in an easier era while having a massive athletic advantage over everyone except Russell who he always fell short to.
"I am going to be rude and say either you don't watch the Thunder often or you have a poor eye for basketball, because to say Russell Westbrook is ""score first"" is absolutely ludicrous. You might as well call Lebron ""score first"". Russell Westbrook consistently initiates offensive possessions looking to create plays, the most clear examples being in PnR sets with Adams as a screener."
The best iso scorers last year:  1. James Harden. 12.2 isolation points per game.  2. Lebron James. 6.1 isolation points per game.  3. Chris Paul – 5.6 isolation points per game.  4. John Wall – 4.9 isolation points per game.  5. Damian Lillard – 4.2 isolation points per game.  6. Russell Westbrook – 4.1 isolation points per game.  7.

Kyrie Irving – 3.7 isolation points per game. 
"Along with AD, KD, Kawhi, Russell Westbrook, Canon Curry, Steph Curry, ma dukes, Dennis Rodman and Buzz Lightyear."
"Bill ""Russell"" Westbrook "
Yo dude I'm a Warriors fan. Russell Westbrook is great. He is a legit superstar.  You are beyond help. 19 straight losses must have caused some unfortunate damage to you.
"Its like saying its possible to put Russ in a team where he learns TP9 loops and excel. In another dimension, Russell Westbrook has done that. But not **THIS** dimensions' Russell Westbrook. "
I look forward to Russell Westbrook going heave ho and chucking up 40 shots in his final playoff game. The Lakers won't do that btw. We want another star. We let go of Larry Nance to get rid of Jordan Clarkson so we could get more cap space. 
"Were those top five finishes because of Russell or because of Durant? And if they were because of Russell, how much of it was because of his passing specifically (note: this distinction can also be raised with Lebron and can *very* clearly be seen with both Curry and Harden)?  I am not necessarily saying Westbrook is a disappointment in that regard, but the best passer in the league usually has an enormous impact on his team’s offence; from what I have seen, Westbrook is not at that level."
"Yup haha, it's very easy to forget how great everyone else is playing too. The final two spots could really go to any of these guys:  |Player|PTS/G|REB/G|AST/G|TS%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Paul George|**26.9**|8.0|4.0|.581| |Damian Lillard|26.2|4.8|6.2|.589| |Kyrie Irving|23.5|4.8|6.9|**.605**| |Russell Westbrook|21.9|**10.8**|**10.7**|.481|  &amp;#x200B;"

Kyrie Irving v Russell Westbrook
"Could Russell Westbrook, Ronnie 2k, and the midget beat the five best players on both teams combined? "
In December he averaged 18ppg on 38.1/29.8/76.5 (47% TS) shooting. That is atrocious. Thats less efficient than Russell Westbrook has been this season. 
"The numbers Giannis are putting up are also insane, albeit not as much as Harden's. But when you factor in that he's the best player and best defender on the league's best team, you have a very compelling case.  The NBA MVP was the first seed of his conference **31 out of 39** times (78%).   In the instances where this wasn't the case, the MVP was on the second seed **5 out of 8** times.  That leaves us 3 instances in 39 years where the MVP was on a worst seed than 2. You have:  * Moses Malone in 1982 (6th seed Houston Rockets)  * Michael Jordan in 1988 (3rd seed Chicago Bulls)  * Russell Westbrook in 2017 (6th seed OKC Thunder)  Harden's case is that the stats he's putting up are on par with what these 3 players were doing."
"pete rose said ""'If Barry Bonds isn't a Hall of Famer, you shouldn't have a Hall of Fame'""  i say, ""if Russell Westbrook is a Hall of Famer, you shouldn't have a Hall of Fame'"""

"People keep focusing on ""the correct way"", but the bigger thing is the killer gene. Harden has never had it in the post season, maybe this year it will change. I don't know if any player in the NBA has it. Changes in reffing might have contributed to this, the game isn't as physical on both ends anymore.   As a competitor I think Westbrook is the closest, but having that gene and consistently demoralizing people in the post season is different than the regular season. Other than LeBron and the Cavs I don't think we have seen a team have someone individually flat out lead in a while now. The Warriors win by committee. LeBron had a drafted Kyrie and a Kevin Love (put what worth you want into him) and I don't think many people were going to line up in free agency to play with him. Same goes with Harden, he is so ball dominant there hasn't really been a big name go the distance with him (Chris Paul isn't the same anymore) so I guess the only duo left that could mimic the older days would be Russell and George. Its just a different time period with a different play style and their is no way to simulate how good current teams would be under the old NBA. The physicality level and shit talking was on another level, and they let them play. The fouls Harden is getting now would never have went in those days. They let them get pretty nasty back then. Then again, people didn't spread the floor like they did today so it would be interesting to see the two styles clash."
"He made a great post that wasn't about individual stats.  *Bruh.*  It talked greatly about how Bill Russell anchored improvements in **team** stats, when Wilt didn't do it to nearly the same degree with the exception of one year, which of course is the year he won the NBA championship in 1967.  OP also talked about how at his peak, Wilt was the better player, so nowhere is there a Celtic bias here. The man said he was a Pistons fan lol and just started to root for good basketball. He also talked about how sometimes stat-padding helps a team win. However, sometimes it doesn't (like Wilt setting statistical goals for himself each season instead of actually just trying to win).  This is essentially the Russell Westbrook vs Steph Curry argument.  Westbrook is more talented in pretty much everything but shooting the ball. HOWEVER, when Steph is on the floor, the **entire** game changes. Your team immediately becomes better, and **every** player is elevated. Westbrook has gaudy stats, and is a stat-padding machine (don't kid yourselves on this one he definitely pads his stats sometimes for better as I already mentioned and sometimes for worse), but he doesn't even come close to elevating the players around him. Steph has essentially turned Klay and Draymond into perennial all-NBA players. He didn't benefit from them. They benefited from him. It's the same with Russell. Those players sure were great, but he didn't benefit from them. He would've been great anywhere. They benefited from him.  But ok *bruh*. Try learning how to read."
Sonics - Gary Payton Thunder - Russell Westbrook Both - Nick Collision
"&gt; but haven't his apologists noticed that pretty much literally everyone defending him is a fan of the team he's on?   not true at all  &gt; Rockets fans seem the least willing to criticize their franchise player.   we criticize him enough, but delving in the absurd points such as 1) Harden would not be a superstar if doesn't get fouls, 2) all Harden does is flop 3) criticizing him during legit basketball plays where is actually fouled 4) he is unwatchable is something we don't do because it is absurd.   A good example. A video posted the other day claiming Harden ""lunged"" into the defender. He shot a legit three pointer with the defender going under him. EVERY player that is in a close game down the stretch would go for the four point play. Paul George did it against us a week ago and Russell Westbrook did it yesterday. Where are the videos with 1000 comments claiming they are ruining the game? Sorry, a lot of the stuff people complain about are legit fouls. A lot of the stuff he does to sell contact are things every player does, except you don't have neckbeards posting those videos every game."
Russell Westbrook
It’s also worth pointing out that the thunder are 3rd in the west and Russell Westbrook is leading the league in assists per game.  There’s a lot more to the game then puttin the ball in the hoop.
"Wait, his dad was Russell Westbrook Jr.?  That makes him Russell Westbrook III, Russ The Third"
"this will never be a true statement because Russell Westbrook can actually play defense. yes, Westbrook will pull a LeBron and not give any effort on D a lot of the time, but a flip can be switched, something Damian Lillard can't do. Westbrook is still the better player and if the Thunder play the Blazers in the playoffs it will be plainly obvious."
Russell Westbrook is not the all-time Sonics scoring leader. I watched all those games and he didn’t score that many.
Russell Westbrook has his first high volume high efficiency game in a while and PG decides to have his worst game of the season lmao  
It was nice to see THAT Russell Westbrook again
Russell Westbrook you are so fun to watch man.

Man that’s huge pickup for Paul George and Russell Westbrook! 💪😎
"Anthony Davis, Paul George, and Russell Westbrook are playing on national TV and New Orleans fans can't even fill up the arena halfway. "
"That take on Russell Westbrook from the forum was harsh, but to be honest, at the time it made sense and seems reasonable. There were good reasons behind that assessment, and that just shows how much we don't know about players' development. At the draft, teams are basically trying to project a ceiling for a player from a point where the player hasn't even shown or mastered their fundamental skill sets yet TBH. Basically, so much can change and the draft, no matter how much scouting you do, can still be a crapshoot because players can change so much.   Drafting is still an area that's ripe for finding competitive advantages because teams have some sort of mind kindness over players they have watched and listened to and coveted for a whole season.  It's fascinating.   Anyway, credit to Westbrook, he's come a very long way. He's worked hard and he's now one of the best in the league. "

"Disagree hard with over Kemba since Kemba is better in just about every category except shooting percentages and that’s still really close, and considering Kembas higher usage rate and defensive attention he gets it’s understandable. Westbrook I can see because of his inefficiency offensively but at the end of the day averaging a triple double is surreal and Russell has a better VORP and higher BPM than both Klay and Kemba. Plus Russell’s rebounding% is 16.3 which is godly for a guard and an absurd 47.3 assist %. "
Russell Westbrook drafted 4th overall to the Seattle SuperSonics 
Russell Westbrook wasn’t no Sonic in my eyes. Fuck you howard
"The first 3 draft grades I came across from 2008 praised the move, and the fourth was more skeptical but still kind of liked it.  I just don't remember many people questioning it as a reach, and my initial search at least backs that up.  Positive  &gt;Another brilliant draft from Sam Presti and Rich Cho. Westbrook was thought to be in play all over the top-10 leading up to the draft; picking him at No. 4 was considered no small risk. As it turns out, he's clearly one of the three best players from the draft, and many would take him No. 2. To land Ibaka at No. 24 is pure frosting. And hey, who remembered that there was a Hardin on this team before there was a Harden?  Positive  &gt;The Sonics GM Sam Presti is surrounding Kevin Durant with some great defenders. Russell Westbrook is one of the most athletic players in the draft, just ask Cal or Oregon. He won Pac-10 defensive player of the year and it should translate into good defense in the league. It will take him a year or two to learn the point guard position but he will be solid. Has a chance to be a Gilbert Arenas type with less scoring. Ibaka from the Congo is only 18 years old and when he finally makes it to Oklahoma City he will be a beast. I wouldn't be surprised if he blocks 3 shots a game soon. D.J. White is a horse with a decent jump shot and should bring a spark off the bench. Hardin is a project but will bring a defensive presence right away.  Positive  &gt;The team without a home had a solid draft adding one potential star in the backcourt (Westbrook) and some solid frontcourt potential. Gm Sam Presti did a solid job to resist the temptation to add Brook Lopez and take a player with considerably more upside at the fourth pick in Russell Westbrook. It's decisions like this that define a GM, and Presti made an excellent one. Ibaka is a solid gamble for the future who likely won't see NBA action for 3-4 years. DJ White, while on the small side (reportedly measuered 6'6.25 without shoes) has an enormous wingspan 7'3 and great leaping ability making him a Jason Maxiell type of player. Hardin is a tremendous athlete at his size with limited drive and skill.  Skeptical  &gt;I love Westbrook (5) and believe he has the skill set to eventually be a great point guard, but I know Jerryd Bayless does have the offensive skills to be a great point guard.  Bayless works extremely well without the ball and would have been the perfect point guard for a system built around Kevin Durant.  While not a defender like Westbrook, Bayless has enough athleticism and desire to be well above average.  Westbrook will be a great player, regardless, because of his skills defensively, but if he doesn't become a great point guard, for the sake of argument, then they will be stuck with an energy 6th man.  There is a slight chance that Westbrook ends up being a better player than Bayless, but I don't like that risk/reward equation.  "
Also he doesn't have anyone near as good as Russell Westbrook on his team 
"[“Athletic and explosive combo guard with the length to make up for his lack of height … Attacks the basket with a lethal first step and crossover ability … Can handle the rock well and gets into the lane effortlessly … Finishes well at the rim and is unafraid to go up in traffic … Huge wingspan allows him to play much bigger than his 6-3 height … Gets good lift on his jumpshot and has a quick release … Solid passer with unselfishness, always looks for the open man … Has an excellent mid-range game … A gym rat, really works hard to improve Has a great attitude, extremely coach-able … Has the potential to be a bigtime scorer when given the chance … Really excels defensively and has a chance to develop into a great defender … His anticipation for steals and his on ball defensive ability are special Solid passer who shows the ability to play the point guard position …”](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/russell-westbrook)"
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook was named Pac-10 defensive player of the year as a sophomore. Teams saw an elite defensive player with amazing quickness and athleticism who had a great work ethic. The only two serious knocks on him were his outside shot and relative lack of experience.

had no idea that was THE russell westbrook i knew back when i was car shopping in the IE area..
HELP!!  &amp;#x200B;  I dont use this sub very often but the other day i was stumbled upon a thread about Russell Westbrook and how he is leading the league in assists and what not. Anyone know where i can get that thread or is it gone? i swear it was a popular thread i thought it would be easy to find.

"&gt; Weaver flashes back to Khelcey Barrs, Westbrook’s high school teammate and best friend, who died during a pickup game in 2004 and was later found to have an enlarged heart. When Weaver scouted Westbrook four years later, he came across a piece of personal information that froze him. “Do you know that after the boy died, Russell would go over to his grandmother’s house and do his chores?”  I fucking love Russ even more now"

"All three do seem deserving at this moment, but that’s the beauty of basketball. After the All-Star break one will emerge above the rest.    This is my own crazy theory, but imagine Russell Westbrook has a triple-doubles in every single game now down the line. Will he enter the MVP talks like he did when he averaged one or will it just take away from PG’s MVP votes?   Averaging one and get one every game in a streak much like Hardens current streak is a different and more impactful thing in a historical scale.   It’s been a great basketball year so far and I’m excited for this MVP race to heat up and the east playoff seeding slaughterhouse to start. "

"&gt;	Uhhhh because I’m a diehard laker fan and have watched every single game since 2003? I remember it vividly. Our backcourt was Nash and Kobe and when they asked Kobe why he was guarding all the point guards at this stage in his career he said “Its either the old guy or the really old guy” there was literally no one else on the team that could do it.  Lol okay man, let’s go with your made up stuff. You say he guarded Russell Westbrook the **entire game**?  Here are his numbers against the lakers:  33 points and 8 assists.   27 points, 7 rebounds, 10 assists  37 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists  So how much was he actually guarding them?

"&gt; Russell has the same usage as last year, is more efficient than last year, gets fewer turnovers, has better WS/48, BPM, and VORP compared to last year.   False. He averaged 14 FG attempts per game last season. 17.7 FG attempts per game this season. Huge difference. He's also averaging 4 more minutes, yet still less than 30 minutes per game. What's funny is that he's averaging the LEAST free throw attempts per game (2.2) in his career.  &gt; Russell is a good player.  He's not a max-level player, which should be a franchise-caliber player. He's inefficient. A lot of scrubs can put up 20 PPG if you let them jack up 17.7 FG per game. Meanwhile, Dinwiddie needs only 12.2 FG to get to 17.2 PPG. LeVert needs 14.1 FG to get to 17.1 PPG. Russell is streaky and inconsistent and still a notorious bad finisher (his ugly floater is an eyesore). If you ever watched him play, he's simply not a smooth player, terrible athleticism and slow-footed. He'll never be more than an instant offense-type off the bench for a contender.  &gt; Oh also, guess what, he's 22. He still has room to improve, and has shown that he is capable of improving as well.  Almost no career is linear, so his age is irrelevant. Brandon Jennings, Ty Lawson, Michael Beasley, Jabari Parker, Andrew Wiggins, and Michael Carter-Williams were padding similar or better stats around the same age. Doesn't make them good players.  &gt; Randle had a quiet market b/c there weren't that many teams with cap space and a lot of money to spend. Randle proved his worth.  He's okay on that short-term contract, but he's neither a rim protector or a stretch 4, so he'll always be a hard sell in this era. There's a lack of defensive stats. His upside is basically David Lee and Lee spent most of his career padding stats for bad teams and getting overpaid until finally Kerr phased him out in favor of Draymond Green and the rest is history.  &gt; Wizards couldn't afford to lose OPJ and the market forced them to max OPJ and hand out the large contract to Wall, b/c otherwise they lose their best recent core.  They didn't have to max Otto Porter because he would've been a restricted FA. Let him hit the open market and see which dumb teams with cap space wanted to max him and then consider matching the offer sheet. Maybe he would've found out the hard way like Noel and Randle.  That's like saying Sonics/Thunder should've given Jeff Green the max to keep him, Durant, and Westbrook together as their ""core."" Gimme a break. Guys like Porter are a dime a dozen and always expendable."

"No. I was pretty happy for Cleveland fans to experience a championship in their lifetime. While I was rooting for the Warriors in the 2016 Finals, I definitely felt happy for LeBron, as I saw a level of joy in his celebration that exceeded those in his previous championships. We got to see a spectacular performance from Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love got to vindicate himself after being a scapegoat for so long, and numerous Cavalier role players who were subjected to unfair criticism (which often happens given the intense media scrutiny on a LeBron team) got to relish in the glory for a bit. Plus we got some great J.R. Smith moments.  More importantly, given how much I hate Clay Bennett, I was very happy to see Kevin Durant leave, and I think he would have been much more likely to leave the Thunder if the Warriors left, as I don't think he was likely to have left for another free agency destination. (As a side note, I now live in Seattle, but the Sonics had already left before I decided to move there, and my distaste of Bennett and all similar owners would have been independent of my residence.) I also think that the Durant/Westbrook pairing was not particularly well-suited for championship success and relied on their individual talents. By leaving, Durant optimized his chances for championships (perhaps too easily) and Westbrook got the opportunity to exhibit his individual brilliance. While I am not fond of his style of play (it is reckless, ball-dominant, and inefficient), but certainly has its merits (stat-stuffing non-stop hustle from one of the most athletic and relentless competitors the game has ever seen). Fans who enjoy that playstyle get to see Russell Westbrook fully unleashed."

"Philip Rivers, Mike Trout, Russell Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook. Seeing that Thunder team win and possibly having Roberson back would be amazing
"I understand the point of your post, but there are some other subtleties that I wanted to address.  Starting with the comparison most favorable to Westbrook, his rebounding statistics are more impressive than Oscar's. The pace in the 1960s was significantly higher than the pace in the current NBA (which has now returned to a 30-year high), with less emphasis on shot selection meaning much more opportunities for rebounds. Oscar Robertson was a good rebounder for his position, but not a spectacular outlier in that regard, and would be less noted generations later if not for our fixation with round numbers and triple double. As a comparison, during that same period in which Oscar Robertson averaged a triple double over a five-year span with rebounding season averages of 10.1, 12.5, 10.4, 9.9, and 9.0, his contemporary, the slightly more senior Elgin Baylor (who entered the league two years earlier) was averaging 19.8, 18.6, 14.3, 12.0, and 12.8. Granted, Baylor was a forward noted for his leaping ability, but both are listed at 6'5"" and noted for being superstar players not exclusive for their rebounding abilities alone.  As far as the other statistics, Oscar Robertson's statistics totals are much more impressive as you noted above. Despite the higher pace of play back then, assist totals are higher today because assists are an inherently a subjective stat that have been inflated by scorekeepers over the years. Of note, there was a pretty amusing primary account on APBR (the best resource for high-level discussion basketball discussion on the Internet) of how a jaded scorekeeper decided to aware 23 assists to Nick Van Exel for shits and giggles: unfortunately, that post looks to be gone, but there is a [Deadspin article](https://deadspin.com/an-assist-for-nick-van-exel-how-an-nba-scorekeeper-coo-30967240) referring to it still available. The lower assist totals are evident in both the lower team averages league-wide in the 1960s, as well as in the much lower averages among league leaders, as the OP has noted (partly due to less emphasis on ball-dominant individual offensive play).  Finally, as OP mentioned, Robertson was tremendously efficient. In fact, his TS% are higher than Westbrook's despite the fact that changes to the style and the rules of the game have dramatically increased offensive efficiency leaguewide, with perimeter players benefiting to a disproportionate extent.  Statistically, I think Russell Westbrook's triple doubles are more impressive in the sense that I think Westbrook would be as likely to average a triple double in the 1960s or accumulate more total triple doubles than Oscar Robertson would today. But as an overall player, there is also no question that Oscar Robertson better (and I do not think it is particularly close)."

"All Russell cares about are triple doubles to over shadow the fact he can’t shoot. 24% from three, 65 % at the line and a 45% FG rate. Paul George is easily the better player on that team and plays way better defense and offense. Last night PG even said Russel asked him for an assist to get the triple double. Russ doesn’t care about winning. He shot 5/19 last night. So how is he a good player for avg a triple double? He isn’t. A good player helps his team win. The nba media is stupid if you think russel Westbrook is impacting his team to win. Only Paul George deserves any credit for these wins they are getting. "
"So I know it'll be impossible to have an honest discussion about this here (would be an intesteding questions for r/nbadiscussion though), but, is it really so crazy to think Ben has been better than Westbrook this season?

Ben is scoring about 4 points a game less with a EFG% 12% higher than Westrbook and TS% 11% higher. Gap in rebounds and assists is only 1 and 2 per 36 on 1 less turnover. Ben has an ORTG 12 points higher and DRTG only 6 points higher. Ben has more WS, though Russ has higher BPM. VORP for Russ is .3 higher. "

Yes efficiency isn't there but he's still doing something no other player in the league is doing"
Every day is also Russell Westbrook Day. 
"defense, Kyrie has made strides but neither one of them are close to the level of Westbrook. Playmaking, sure Westbrook sometimes looks like hes chasing assists but that point is overused, he may not be a flashy passer but his speed and overall 100mph game creates a ton of space for those around him. Rebounding is the same, sure it sometimes looks like hes stat chasing but theres no argument there hes the best rebounding guard we have in todays NBA. So yea, you can knock Westbrook for his shooting, its been atrocious but his overall impact on the game, IMO, holds greater value than Kyrie or Dame, who are both fantastic players in their own right. The whole hating on Russell thing has gotten a little out of control "

"So that’s 21/70. Less than 30%. 3/70 series were won by a team with a bigger deficit in net rating than the Raptors currently have to us, and two of them were LeBron Cavs teams. The other was when Russell Westbrook got injured the series prior.  Obviously we *can* lose. Nobody’s saying we’ll walk through the East with ease. But when only 3 teams in the last decade have been as superior to their opposition and lost anyway, and there are very obvious and impactful reasons for that, concerns about our future performance seem pretty unfounded.  You’re either responding to a take that just doesn’t exist or you’re completely misunderstanding how rare it is for a team to be this good in the regular season and not make a deep playoff run. Either way, even your stats show that we should indeed be heavy favourites."
"Why is it stupid to judge a player on if they're a winner? That's the point of sports.  If the point was to put up good stats, then Russell Westbrook would be considered the greatest basketball player of all time.  We celebrate the best winners because they put up amazing stats and win on top of it.  Kyrie is not a winner. He stunk in Cleveland before LeBron came, and the Celtics have gone to the ECF without him, and now they'll not go to the ECF with him."

In what world does Russell Westbrook have to protect himself from a fan? What a thug.
&gt; Russell Westbrook does things no other PG in the history of basketball could do.  Like what?
Yes he does. And Russell Westbrook does things no other PG in the history of basketball could do. Doesn't mean either of them has a shot at top five all time. 
"Here you go. I'd really recommend subscribing though, it was less than $50 for the year and they have good articles almost everday.  HOUSTON​ —​ Trae Young’s​ perspective​ on basketball changed in one night​ in​ November 2016. As with​ almost every Oklahoma City​ Thunder home​​ game since the team’s relocation from Seattle, Young and his father, Ray, were sitting in Section 121, Row X, Seats 3-4. Chris Paul and the Los Angeles Clippers had come to town, which meant another opportunity for Trae to meet one of his favorite players in the league.  Young was a senior at Norman North High School and one of the top recruits in the country. He had first met Paul when he was 7 years old during Paul’s rookie year, 2005-06, when the New Orleans Hornets had temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City because of Hurricane Katrina’s devastation.  But it was that night during Young’s senior year of high school, as the two talked inside the tunnel of Chesapeake Energy Arena, that Paul made his biggest impression on the young player.  Paul challenged Young to discover his intrinsic motivation for playing the game. Was it because he wanted fame or fortune? Was it because he wanted to provide for his family? Paul told Young that once he found the reason, his sense of motivation would transform.  For Young, the answer rested with his grandfather, to whom he was close before the older man passed away. His grandfather always told Trae that he was going to make it to the NBA one day. Shortly after that conversation with Paul, Trae went to his grandfather’s grave and placed a bracelet on the tombstone. Engraved on the bracelet was this phrase: “What is your why?”  “Ever since then, I started carrying myself differently and started thinking about the game differently,” Young said. “I realized that night that I don’t play for myself. I play for others.”  The relationship between Young and Paul has grown so strong over the years that the Hawks rookie point guard still turns to the Rockets superstar for advice. In high school, he would text and call Paul for tips on how he should handle his recruitment. During his year at Oklahoma, he would ask Paul how he should handle the overwhelming fame brought his way and the constant dissection of every play by fans and media around the country. Now that Young is in the NBA, it’s Paul who has told him that the fandom he held for Paul, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook had to stop. It’s fine to recognize and respect their games, but it shouldn’t go further than that, Paul told him.   Chris Paul, left, has shared lessons learned with Trae Young. (Courtesy of Ray Young) That hasn’t been an issue for Young during his rookie season. He’s always had that mindset, and it’s something he’s picked up from Paul and Westbrook when he was growing up in Oklahoma and going to Hornets and Thunder games.  “Whenever I play against you, we’re not friends anymore. We’re enemies,” Young said. “We’re competing against each other, and that’s how I look at it. We could be friends and talk afterwards, but once we’re on the court, none of that matters to me. I only care about winning and taking care of business.”  Young dropped a career-high 36 points and eight 3-pointers Monday night against Paul and the Rockets. A few hours before the game, his father reminded him not to get caught up in the moment of playing against one of his mentors, that Paul is the type of player who might throw an elbow in your chest and try to get into your head. The only time Young lets the realization of going up against his idols get to him is during warm-ups. Young said he looks across the court before games and soaks up the moment. After introductions, however, the feelings of awe are over.  After the Rockets beat the Hawks on Monday night, Houston head coach Mike D’Antoni went up to Paul and said, “Man, he can play.” Paul laughed and said, “Yeah, I already knew that.” Young has been to several of Paul’s camps through the years, and the Houston guard knew Young was going to be a problem when he got to the league.  “I knew that right away because he’s ultra-competitive,” Paul told The Athletic. “He’s fun to watch because he’s so skilled. I think that’s what people may miss when watching him. His handles, man. He can come off a ball screen, and he can stop and whip it to the other side of the court with his left hand.  “It ain’t maybe four or five guys in the entire NBA that can do that, and he does it efficiently. He’s only going to get better and better.”   Embedded video  Jackson Frank @jackfrank_jjf  This left-handed bullet from Trae Young is nutty  517 1:29 AM - Feb 26, 2019 86 people are talking about this Twitter Ads info and privacy Paul watches games around the league every night. He has watched several Hawks games because of his relationship with Young, as well as with John Collins, who shares a bond because both went to Wake Forest, and head coach Lloyd Pierce. Before the game, Paul went over to the Hawks’ bench and dapped Pierce up. After the game, Paul hugged Young and told him to keep going and stay patient.  Paul said the reason he takes pride in mentoring Young is because of the rookie’s desire to continually get better and because Young makes it a point to stay in touch. Paul said some players ask for advice, and that’s it. Even now, when Young sees Paul have a good night on the floor, he’ll send quick “good game, bro” texts. Even for someone of Paul’s stature, that means something.  “Even now, when I’m watching games, I keep in touch with him,” Paul said. “If someone keeps in touch with you, you’re going to want to keep in touch with them. I’m always willing to help someone who wants the help.”  Paul has heard the criticism about Young’s game since the rookie was in high school and playing AAU basketball, which Paul is heavily involved in. Young has always felt like he had something to prove because of his height. Watching Paul in person during his rookie year gave Young the confidence that a small point guard could make it in the NBA. Paul still counsels Young to use those doubts as fuel.  “You hear some of the visiting commentators talk about the deep threes he takes when they don’t go in, and they’ll be like, ‘Oh, who does he think he is? Why is he pulling up from that deep?'” Paul said. “He’s been doing that since he’s been playing AAU. He’s more than capable of making those shots. When he was in college, I told him that the NBA is going to be easier than college because the court is so open. When he can handle the ball like that, he’s a handful.  “I couldn’t shoot it like that when I came into the league — hell, I still can’t shoot like that right now. I used to talk to him all of the time about defense because when you’re a young guy in this league, one of the biggest things you have to do is learn how to defend. Once he keeps working on that, he’s going to be fine.”   Trae Young, second from right, worked out with Chris Paul, right, and James Harden, left, this past summer. (Courtesy of Ray Young) Seven hours before Young’s stellar night against Paul and the Rockets, he sat on one of the courtside chairs inside the Toyota Center and talked about his bond with Paul and what he has learned from the Houston guard through the years. He talked about the alpha mentality the two share, the belief that he is better than the point guard he’s going up against that night.  He also talked about the Rookie of the Year race with Luka Doncic, the player he’ll forever be linked to because of the draft-night trade between Atlanta and Dallas. Young smiled when asked about the consensus from the media that the race is already over and the award is essentially waiting for Doncic. Young proceeded to have his best game of the season on the same night Doncic finished with a triple-double against Paul’s former team, the Clippers.  “I don’t think the race is over,” Young said. “At the same time, that’s not really my main focus. But I don’t think the Rookie of the Year race is over just yet. You see guys come out all of the time super hot and get all of the hype and deservedly so. Luka has had a terrific year so far. But there’s been multiple times where there’s been co-winners, or it’s been flipped at the end just like last year with Donovan (Mitchell) and Ben (Simmons).”  Even if Young doesn’t win the award, Paul believes he is going to have a long career in the league because of his work ethic and his success in the pick-and-roll game. Paul said the pick-and-roll is “what the NBA is about, for the most part,” and Young’s court vision and the ability to make something happen every time he’s on the offensive end of the floor separate him from many players around the league. The court is just more open for guards who can handle the ball the way Young does.  As for Young, he’s going to continue to ask Paul for advice whenever he can because he’s reminded every time they talk that an undersized point guard can excel in the league.  “He saw this short point guard from Wake Forest out on the floor doing work,” said Young’s father, Ray. “You have to be able to believe that you can do it, too. I can preach to him until I’m blue in the face that he’s good enough and can make it, but until you see it like Trae saw it with Chris, that’s when he really believed it could happen for him, too.”  Said Young: “The way Chris carries himself, the way he gives back and the way he is with younger players is the same way I want to be when I get older.”"

"Bill dominated his era and is the greatest defender of ALL TIME. In 50 years the players that Lebron faced will look like weaklings also. That is why I rate players based on dominance in their ERA. Russell totally dominated his era, frankly Lebron has not. A ton of other Super Stars have won rings during Lebron's prime: Curry, Duncan, KD, Dirk, Kawhi, KG, Pierce, Kobe, ect.  During Russell's prime NO ONE ELSE WON.   Lebron has not dominated scoring. He only won 1 scoring title and ZERO assists titles.  He is a great combination of scoring and assists because he dominated the BALL. Like I said Westbrook put up 32/10/10 and Harden is at 36/7/8 when given the same ball domination as Lebron.  Lebron's assist stats are more about how much he holds the ball. His rebounds is about him playing forward.  Most forwards who are 6'9"" can easily grab 7 rebounds a game."
He handled it like we expect Russell Westbrook to do so.

"I'll raise my thoughts on another issue in this whole ordeal. I went to a McDonald's a few months ago near my job which is at an affluent part of NY. There was a man with his son who was berating the employees and said questionable racial statement such as don't these workers even understand English and they hire just about anyone towards latino based workers. They were honestly doing their best to fix the situation and handle the customers during this dinner rush. I walked to the guy and told him to relax and stop being an asshole to these hard working people. Be an example to your son. Not sure why he remained quiet after talking to him if he was in the right he should have continued to berate these workers. Apparently, the people behind me told me after he left he raised a fist towards me when I was talking with him and were surprised I didn't react accordingly. I happen to be an amateur boxer which probably would have not been a smart decision on his end.   I don't want to group all rich parents as being poor parents but there is a reason why rich kids are out of control. They see inaction by their parents and lack of boundaries in the Russell Westbrook incident. When they do spend time with their kids, they are not being a good example. I did go to an affluent white high school in the suburbs( I am latino who attended based on exam scores) and some relatives of mine are affluent now. Just seeing how some kids act without thinking of the consequences is frightening. Growing up in harlem and NYC, I knew if I wronged someone I could get jumped or at the minimal get into a fight so I minded my own business. I also recognized making poor decisions can lead to legal issues. The things I heard or saw my peers do while growing up and it being swept under the rug opened my eyes to the advantages of rich vs poor aside from the obvious. This kid and his parents see this as a joke or an overreaction on russ. A very similar response I saw through out high school of ""boys will be boys""."
Russell Westbrook is itching to fight someone (sigh) but I bet my savings account that dude does not know how to throw hands or grapple.
"Getting defensive a little much, aren’t we? I called you out for making a weak point about ticket tack foul calls, and you call me a bitch boy and an idiot. Russell Westbrook-esque temper tantrum."
"That was rude, but the guy didn't touch Westbrook.  And Westbrook says  &gt; you can’t react and do the things that we need to do to protect ourselves.  Yet WB pushed the guy away, and I'm sure the guy got in more trouble than Russell did. "

I wouldn't exactly say that means the kid has no idea how to act in public. Russell Westbrook being a foot from your face is not an everyday situation. "
"Oof. This is a tough conversation for me to read because my lifelong dream has always been to get courtside dap from my favorite player after a big play.

"These aren’t really grown men though, these are young millennials who are 24, 22, and 20 years old, who are sensitive to criticism, especially when it comes from somebody that they probably all looked up to before he was traded here, and they probably (unjustifiably) believe the constant criticism isn’t warranted because of their success without him last year.   I respect your thoughts on this, but really, I don’t think you know what you’re talking about since you haven’t followed this team as close as Celtic fans like myself have, this season has been a complete 180 in terms of team chemistry, and everything changed once Kyrie got injured last year.   Nobody has told me why Kyrie, the “leader” of the team wasn’t supporting his team in Game 7 of the ECF last year. You think those guys aren’t aware of that? You also think they’re not aware of the noise of Kyrie’s free agency and that he might leave, so why is he in a position to lecture them, especially since this dude is dumb enough to think that the Earth is flat but pretends he’s some super intellectual? You also think they’re not aware of the noise that they might be traded for Anthony Davis?   Players aren’t robots man.   This team is a perfect example of not everything working out like it would on paper, because on paper this team has 60+ win talent, so much so that almost everybody including the most cautious analysts, predicted them to be right around that # and they are going to fall woefully short.   Obviously Kyrie isn’t solely to blame, the entire team, coaching staff, and organization shares blame for this failed season, but Kyrie certainly hasn’t helped matters with his public comments this year and that’s something that literally everybody except you recognizes.   I would kill for Kyrie to be a true leader like Russell Westbrook is, when has Russ ever thrown any of his teammates under the bus? "
"Is it a shot though if jokic didn’t touch it? That’s the issue.  I know this impossible. But imagine Russell Westbrook is driving on the correct basket. Jokic gets in the way and takes the charge, offensive foul. As Russ is falling he throw the ball and it bounce off the rim alllll the way across the court and into the opposing basket. Does that count? Seems the same to me. And is it a three pointer if it’s your own basket?"
"I think he wanted to pat him, realized he was further away than he thought at first, so ended up having to reach out pretty far which makes it look like a shove. It is just because he is jus an awkward kid, excited that Russell Westbrook is right there and had almost run into him."

"No. First, older Lebron will constantly call younger Lebron kid, pal, lil guy, and scout. Younger Lebron will post some kind of the future is now meme. Older Lebron will go to the team and ask that young be traded for some guys that don’t talk back as much. Young will have already gone behind old’s back and have a trade set up that sends old to the Thunder for everyone on the team except Russ.  Young Bron wins the title. Old Bron gets knocked out in the first of the playoffs and later that night is arrested for the murder of Russell Westbrook."
"It only sort of rewards any form of empty stats. The full equation for OWS is:  MO = (points produced) - 0.92 * (league points per possession) * (offensive possessions)  MP = Marginal points per win reduces to 0.32 * (league points per game) * ((team pace) / (league pace))  MO/MP = OWS  You may be thinking of an older form of the OWS equation used for players in the 70s which does reward TRB, but this equation does not. It is primarily concerned with scoring, assisting, and offensive rebounds, only one of which would particularly lean in Dre's favor.  DWS further uses  MD = (player minutes played / team minutes played) * (team defensive possessions) * (1.08 * (league points per possession) - ((Points allowed * 100/.96 * (FGA − ORb + TO + (.44 * FTA))) / 100))  MPPW = 0.32 * (league points per game) * ((team pace) / (league pace))  DWS = MD/MPPW  Then you simply add DWS + OWS = WS.   So it does reward empty stats to a certain extent, I suppose, but not entirely in ways that help Drummond. So far as I understand, no part of that equation directly rewards DRB, only ORB (which, I do recognize, he is especially good at). Further, I think in general it leans a little hard on assists, if you check through the equation, especially given how points produced works, and that's one of Drummond's weaker points.   &gt;  real-plus minus  I don't know much about RPM, I generally trust basketball reference's BPM, which actually places Drummond even lower, at 24th among Cs on the year. Their BPM since 2014 rates him 24th as well, though both seem very questionable to me.  BPM also rates Plumlee and Noel ahead of Embiid this year, and has Nogueira in 6th place in the NBA since 2014, so I'd be curious to learn more about RPM if you'd be willing to share its advantages over BPM.    Looking at the RPM list actually only really raises further questions, as it places Vucevic ahead of Gobert, Looney ahead of Gasol, Pachulia ahead of Drummond, Baynes ahead of Aldridge, Bertans ahead of Westbrook, Iguodala ahead of Kemba, Plumlee ahead of Adams, Marvin Williams ahead of Doncic, Zaza ahead of Ben Simmons, Birch ahead of Capela, etc.  I'm not a huge fan of either of this as an accurate measurement - any list with Kevon Looney as a more important player on court than Russell Westbrook deserves a second glance. From looking at their equation I understand that the intent was to remove the effect of teammates' from that player's BPM, but I question how effective it was when 4 of the top 40 are Warriors, and all 4 of those have higher RPMs than all stars like Kemba Walker.   Even more telling should probably be last place - Kevin Knox is, by RPM, the worst player in the NBA. That doesn't really make sense, and when you check who else is at the very bottom, you'll notice that the final 10 is just random bench players and the Knicks' third unity - Trier, Ntilikina, and Knox are all right here.  I don't know enough about RPM to fully get into its positives or negatives, though this has been enlightening to remember that bball reference's BPM also doesn't really pass the eye test. Still, with such heavy weighting for mediocre bench Warriors and weighting against some great Knicks, I'd imagine there's some faults in the RPM that I can't recognize, but can identify the results of. Would be curious if you know what is causing this."

"&gt;he is still too small to dominate the league with that style.  How has this narrative still floating around?  Trae Young is 6'2"".

I think he has the talent to pull it off.   Also, someone shooting \~40% from 3 and hitting 10+ 3s per game is such an insanely unrealistic thing. Trae would go down as one of the greatest shooters of all time if he is doing that. That would be 30 (minimum) to 40 ppg on roughly 40% from 3. He would be in the upper echelon of elite shooters at that mark"

"What?  Yes, players tend to shoot better when Russell Westbrook is on the floor with them instead of Dennis Schroeder or whatever other god awful point guard is on the floor.  That was what I said. Russ is good, and attracts a lot of attention, which gives other guys better opportunities to score and get good shots.  That is the point I was making.  This doesn’t prove that Russ is actually efficient; he’s not. The thunder are better with him because he’s way better than the alternative on their roster, not because he actually would be better than any number of other Star point guards in the league. "
"&gt;21-year-old Russell Westbrook was a better passer than Smith??? LOOOOOL.  Smith's assist to turnover ratio in his second season is 4.9 assists to 3 turnovers. Westbrook's was 8 assists to 3 turnovers, so yes, Westbrook was a better passer in his age 21 season. I've watched nearly all of Smith's games as a Maverick. He really struggles with decision making out of the PnR. He also tends to over dribble without purpose and can hold onto the ball too long rather than swing it to create motion within the offense.

21-year-old Russell Westbrook was a better passer than Smith??? LOOOOOL.  He didn't struggle with sharing the ball at NC State. He posted two triple-doubles and played with a subpar cast of characters. His objective was to score as much as possible in order for them to win. 
"I disagree. I think most point guards today are scoring guards. I also think he's growing as a decision maker. Most young PGs struggle with learning the position at the NBA level, and he is no different. Shit, Russell Westbrook is still an awful decision maker who could be considered out of position by point guard purist. "
"That’s probably because most teams are starting to play more like GSW, where you have multiple playmakers and ball handlers. If you look at 2017, James Harden, John Wall and Russell Westbrook all averaged double digit assists. This year Westbrook is the only one, with 11 APG. Teams are starting to realise it’s better to have multiple playmakers and ball handlers to initiate the offence, rather than one. Steph, KD and Draymond might all be near the top in APG but that’s just because of the culture them and Kerr have created. "
It's the Russell Westbrook phenomenon where he normalized the triple double. 
"No way man, how could anyone think that? Next you’re gonna tell me that Russell is the better of the two between DLo and Westbrook"
"I mean advanced defensive stats are trash. Russell Westbrook MVP year he was not a good defender and admitted as much. PG literally worked with him on that the offseason after he got to OKC. But by advanced metrics, his MVP season he was a great defender because most advanced defensive stats factor in rebounding. Currently LBJ is having a good rebounding season as such, DBPM has him as a positive when he has not been.  I mean, would you really rather have LeBron than Draymond for defense? PJ Tucker, Pat Beverley, Marcus Smart, Ibaka, Capela and PG are all lower than him on DBPM. DWS similar.  He is considered the 63rd best defender. James Harden 26th. Advanced defensive stats are not good. Most are box score state generated."

"This season I'd say Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jerami Grant  honourable mention to TFerg and Noel, but they both foul too much and Noel doesn't play enough minutes"
This has nothing to do with the Lakers or Clippers. This is about Russell Westbrook and OKC. He's comfortable. He's sure of the organization. And now he is succeeding because of it. Kawhi was not sure of San Antonio. He felt bad about how the organization handled his injury. Toronto is handling his injury well. Every other day his load is managed. Next year he will likely consummate the Raptor relationship and not pull out. 
Nah make it accurate. Russell Westbrook won him over. When PG re-signed I believe it was Royce Young who wrote a great piece about how strong the relationship between him and Russ was that made it damn near impossible for him to want to leave.

"This really is insane. If I'm not mistaken, at one point weren't all these guys there at the same time: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Reggie Jackson, Serge Ibaka, Steven Adams, Jeff Green, Enes Kanter.   Amazing they never won. "
"Aside from the disastrous Harden trade, Sam Presti dropped the ball by drafting busts in McGary/Huestis/Perry Jones (bad scouting), and trading away multiple first round picks for marginal upgrades in Kanter/Waiters/Schroder/Grant (also one of the reasons why the Pelicans are so bad despite having immense top end talent). Not to mention he hired Scott Brooks (awful coach) and Billy Donovan (utterly mediocre coach). The Thunder might be headed for a first round exit if they're unfortunate enough to fall to 8th seed, and Presti is partly to blame for that.  Kevin Durant wasn't wrong when he publicly admitted on Twitter that Russell Westbrook was the only redeeming thing left about OKC when he left for GS in 2016."

"I'm a Raptors fan but my 2nd favourite team is OKC. 1st game I ever watched on tv was a Raptors vs OKC game, and since then I've just casually enjoyed watching every Raptors or Thunder game I could.

[Joel Embiid: Russell Westbrook ‘Always in His Feelings’](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/joel-embiid-russell-westbrook-always-in-his-feelings/)
"&gt;real boujee  Why did this take me out?! lol. I don't think Russell Westbrook is a problem, he just has a huge chip on their shoulder. Almost all NBA players do."
"Seriously man, especially if you dare to say something that isn't overwhelmingly positive about Russell Westbrook."
"Are they better because Thunder fans on here tell you they are?Or because the media acted like PG is in the MVP discussion?Wait ,I know what it was...RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS ALL DEFENSE FIRST TEAM THIS YEAR!!!Thats it right?"
"I'll certainly give you his last season at Phoenix, but that was, as you said, four years ago. His All-Star last year appearance was utterly undeserved as everybody knows, so that's not an argument.  Just looking at his Miami tenure, what makes you think he's not an average starting point guard? In about four seasons of game time, he's averaging about 17 PPG while hovering around 55-56 TS% (which is pretty much league average by the way). He's not a great rebounder, a mid-tier playmaker and net even on defense at best. So once again, why is he better than average?  Let's look at all the starting PGs in the league. In no order, Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Irving, Lowry, Simmons, Walker, Conley, Paul, Bledsoe and healthy Wall are all undeniably better. These are 11 names already. Probably 12 with Russell. Then you have Holiday, Doncic and Mitchell who are also clearly better while have been only playing the PG position part-time, but especially Jrue is quite obviously best fit at PG. Upcoming talents like Fox, both Murrays and Trae certainly have their cases, too. So if you look at it like that, how many starting PGs are actually clearly worse than Dragic? Not that many.    I can live with people disagreeing and downvoting, but I'd like to hear for once why exactly Dragic is not an average starter."
"League fucked. This reminds me of that Westbrook story i.e. why he plays the way he does. The [article](https://sports.vice.com/en_ca/article/4xzq49/i-believe-that-khelceys-energy-is-inside-russell-the-legacy-of-khelcey-barrs) notes that he lost his best friend while they were young, and since then, WB plays with the force of two players. Sometimes, this shit really is bigger than basketball."
"Kawhi hasn't played in the playoffs since 2017 and in the interim has just concluded his statistically most impressive season yet. By your logic, Kyrie isn't at that level anymore because we haven't seen him in the playoffs since 2017.  Truth is, there are 16 game players and 82 game players.  Guys like Giannis, Ben Simmons, Eric Bledsoe, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, are all 82 game players.  They have great numbers in the regular season, but when you need a consistent killer to make tough shots and win you playoff games, they're can't get it done.  Kawhi has been a 16 game player since at least 2016, and he doesn't lose that designation until he proves he's no longer that player, in the playoffs."
How many times did you listen to Russell Westbrook on a farm before recording this?
"Okay, so let me amend it: LeBron led a star studded roster of **Kyle Korver, JR Smith, Cedi Osman, and Larry Nance** to 4th in their conference. Without LeBron, they would have finished **DEAD LAST**, as you are seeing this year. This isn't hard. The award is based on value, and if moving 11 spots up the conference standings is not value to you, then i cannot help you understand.  Also, in 2017 Russell Westbrook was named MVP. I am giving you the comparison to the MVP that year, meaning that they contributed the same to their respective teams and LeBron's team finished higher in the standings. Therefore, LeBron brought more value to his team."
"Okay, let me ask you a question then: Did Russell Westbrook deserve to win the MVP on the 2016-17 OKC Thunder that finished 6th overall in the Western Conference? Did he bring **value** to his team? Or did LeBron bring more value to a team that without him finished as a lottery team before he arrived? Russ didn't bring as much value as LeBron did, yet he still won the award.  The award was given to Russ because the NBA wanted to market his triple double season, which shouldn't have been enough to give him the MVP since Oscar Robinson did the exact same thing in 1965 and they gave the award to Bill Russell who won the Celtics a championship because he elevated his team to a championship level. Bill Russell won 5 MVPs because he brought VALUE to a team that won TEN championships (but I shouldn't have to tell you that, right?)"

Russell westbrook is the best 3pt shooter of all time
Russell Westbrook is good at getting triple-doubles.
Russell Westbrook always gives it his all 
Russell Westbrook has the most amazing self confidence ever
"There's something really satisfying about watching a player suddenly become wide-open and throw down a dunk, toss up a floater, or drain a 3. Like a Russell Westbrook sort of moment when he stands at the top of the key, gets the first step, takes off running, the defender gets sealed and pasted by an Adams screen, and Westbrook flies in for a dunk. Or when Steph Curry does that big man corner give-and-go for a wide-open corner 3."
Russell Westbrook catches so much shit from old white dudes who have never touched a basketball in OKC. It’s sad that they don’t realize how lucky we are to have a player as transcendent as him to keep the team afloat. 
"Yes, he lost MVP despite better stats because of Defensive Maestros Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry. How dare I not mention defense from those seasons when comparing him to those DPOY candidates. "
"You said PG fell off the MVP conversation but you named both PG and Russell westbrook above Lou williams on your list, though he isn't doing anything much worse than them, but yet its preposterous to name lou in the same sentence.   I don't undermine my team. I love pat bev and hope he remains a life-long clipper, but he has 0 point games and other teams' defenders don't rush to him while he's on the court with lou on offense. In fact, alot of our players are only used for D like sindarious thornwell, luc mbah a moute, and ty wallace. Cousins even stated this season that playing with stars on the warriors has given him his first opportunity to not always be doubled, as he had been on the kings and that this feels easier for him.  Also, Lou's best quarter average is the fourth quarter, while he plays and closes against the first strings of the other teams.  I dont like the idea that MVP means getting a lot of points on a team with other stars to spread out the D and still having a mediocre record. Lou could demand a lot more minutes, and even to start if he wanted to, and it would more PPG which I'm sure you could agree. I would prefer MVP to be someone who scores efficiently, conducive to a better record for that team, and would make a palpable difference if not on that team (clips were 0-5 this season when Lou didn't play, even back when he we had tobias harris for offensive contribution). I don't even think Kawhi should be in the conversation this year having missed (rested) for way too many games this season, and the raptors record not being drastically different without him. "
Fun fact: Saw Frank Madden post on Twitter that Pat Connaughton has more dunks this season than Russell Westbrook and Donovan Mitchell.  Got to looking and Connaughton is averaging more dunks per minute this season than Westbrook has ever even come close to averaging.
"Do you honestly not know this or are you just being deliberately obtuse? In case it's the former, MVP has almost always gone to the best player on the best team. More liberally, it's the best player on one of the top 3 seeds in either conference. You can count on one hand the number of times an MVP has been crowned with a seed below that. Russell Westbrook had to average a triple double for an entire season to get it, and that was a contentious race even still.   Y'all are the 8 seed. Go outside, take a breath of reality. Lou Will does not deserve even a moment of semi-serious consideration for MVP. "

"THUNDER SMALL FORWARD PAUL GEORGE  Interview with The Athletic conducted on the morning of Saturday, March 16  “The fact remains that the past two years, they haven’t been beat when it comes to the real playing time (the playoffs). I know how it is. I’ve been on teams in Indiana where the locker room was portrayed some way, but internally we were like, ‘Man, we’re good.’ So I don’t necessarily play into that (storyline of the Warriors being vulnerable). But of course, every situation — guys go through stuff. That’s just being realistic. But I don’t think they’re vulnerable. The fact of the matter is they’re going for their third run at a chip, and that’s tough. (But) there’s going to be a breaking point where they’re scratching and clawing and trying to get to that (next) level.”  THUNDER RESERVE FORWARD MARKIEFF MORRIS  Interview with The Athletic  conducted on Thursday, March 14  “With an All-Star of (Cousins’) caliber at the five man spot, he’s not an Al Horford (type of) All-Star, he’s a (Joel) Embiid (type of) All-Star — a guy who needs the ball and who plays with the ball, rebounds, passes, shoots, and they have a lot of those guys. Obviously they still have one of the best records in the league, but the invincibility part is not there anymore.  (There’s) not enough basketballs. There’s only one ball. No matter how you see it, it’s never going to be easy. If Steph (Curry) has got it going, Klay (Thompson) might take the backseat.”  On whether Durant’s looming free agency is the kind of thing that could impact the Warriors on the court…  “People are going to stir shit up all the time, (but) it’s more the actions of the player. If the team feels it, and they think he’s giving off an I’m-going-to-leave-this-postseason vibe, then that’s what it is at the end of the day. Teams are going to try to break teams up. For the three, four years where they were unbeatable, everybody was trying to find little things to fuck their team up, but I’m not sure about the vibe that he’s giving off there, you know what I mean? It doesn’t seem — from the outside looking in — that they’re as happy as they were (before). I mean, they’re winning, and winning cures everything, but it’s not.  “We’ve seen Draymond, what he said (to Durant in that Clippers game) and that’s past basketball, you know what I mean? That’s not basketball. That’s not something that goes on in a locker room. That’s deep down inside, when shit like that comes out.”  THUNDER CENTER STEVEN ADAMS  Interview with The Athletic conducted on Sunday, March 17  “They (the Warriors) have a togetherness just as much as anyone else, I think — I would say. So I think it’s definitely going to help (them in the playoffs), but their (drama) is just a bit more public, I think. People just, I guess, caught them (on camera). They did it right there.  “And that’s fine too. I’ve duked it out with Russ (Westbrook) on the court a couple times — just words coming real hot. And it’s a very quick, like — boom, yelling, like a 30-second thing in a timeout, but as soon as you get on the court it’s dap-em-up and (they’re good).’ It’s usually every year, and it’s everyone (on the team).”  THUNDER POINT GUARD RUSSELL “NEXT QUESTION” WESTBROOK  Interview conducted on Thursday, March 14  On the prospect of facing the Warriors…  “Next question.”"
"I don't mind the statement that he has an higher IQ. Are you trying to say westbrook isn't the hardest working player in the league and that he cant defend? he was known as a lockdown defender before he was drafted. if you really think all westbrook gets is uncontested rebounds you don't watch much thunder basketball. Throughout their careers westbrook averages 1.7 ORebs compared to paul's 0.7. Career avg total rebounds Paul - 4.5 Westbrook - 7.0 Westbrook is reckless yes he turns it over more than paul. But to say westbrook isn't a similar passer to paul is silly. Chris plays like a traditional point guard. Russell is his own entity. Saying chris paul plays with more energy because hes a better defender is obviously just bias shit. Paul has been known to be dirty. whine and make scenes during playoffs, and hasn't done shit in the playoffs except get injured when they needed him the most. I think 99% of reddit would agree westbrook plays with the most energy in the league if not the history of the NBA."
"Being more efficient.   The season you’re using for reference, Jason Kidd shot 38% from the field. For comparison, Russell Westbrook is shooting 42% this year and is constantly getting roasted for his terrible efficiency. "
Russell Westbrook is ass
Russell Westbrook averaging a triple double.  I don't get why this guy isn't in the conversation for MVP. It's his third season in a row averaging this.  I know people love to hate him but come on! No one had ever done this!
dude wtf? it’s russell fucking westbrook bro he won mvp 2 years ago. your fuckin dumb
"1st Team: Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Paul George and Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Joel Embiid  3rd Team: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal, LeBron James, Blake Griffin and Rudy Gobert"
"Nope, it was never an accurate narrative to begin with.  The only one I've ever heard that was close to accurate was ""he could be the best PG in the NBA if he developed a jump shot"".  That's a hell of a big IF to have as an NBA point guard don't you think?  And even if that was the case, that would have been for like 1-2 years before Curry came around.       A lot of these players can ""Wow"" us with their athletic ability etc., but one thing has remained constant throughout the history of basketball and that is this...the smartest teams usually win the championship.  Russell Westbrook plays like an idiot, on both sides of the ball.  He can't control his temper/ego, and often times plays out of control.  He's the type of player to get scored on, then immediately huck up a 3 to try and get back at the other guy.  He's immature, and a poor leader.  Just another overrated superstar.  The media wants to push this narrative that he's a team player but he's still take 21 shots a game and making less than 43% while shooting less than 30% from 3.  Same thing with Damian Lillard....the guy shoots less than 40% in the playoffs but I'm supposed to take him serious like he's a real threat at a title?  There's levels to this shit...and Westbrook was never really on that level."
"This subreddit is going to be drooling over this. When all the haters of r/NBA go to sleep at night, they will have wet dreams of Westbrook lowlights. When they are about to go down on a woman (which I doubt happens for many people on this subreddit) they will be thinking about this. When they are in class and at work, the only thing they'll be working is that dirty little fucking mind of theirs watching and day dreaming about Westbrook sucking [at basketball]. That's right you dirty little Russluts, lick all these fucking lowlights right up off the sweaty fucking court.  Feel free to change the Russell name references to a different player and use this as copy pasta. Could be really useful next time Durant or LeBron has a bad game. "
"the injury narrative isnt as strong anymore considering how many supsuperstars play 60-70 games.  I can def see how he would run you the wrong way though, similiar to russell westbrook though.  He's the best at his position, so he kinda gets more leeway "
"Ok, so given the roster we have right now post-trade deadline, and given the fact that KP won't play, how exactly would you expect our team to function? Carlisle's moved up Brunson to a starter PG role a while back. And you say Luka shouldn't have to play hero ball, ok, who will ease the burden on him?  For what it's worth, if you're bringing up OKC - then you also should note that Russell Westbrook has decided to stick around. Talking about KD being ""pushed out"" is nonsense - that was a personal decision, and so it depends on Luka's personality on whether he wants to leave, not about the role he's being asked to play. And Luka's said multiple times the role he wants to play is to have the ball in his hands, so I'm not sure why you think he'd be discomforted by this. "
lol I can't believe people upvoted this trash comment. Curry is and always will be a far better player than Russ if he suddenly starts shooting 20% and is out of the league in two years.   Russell has been on a team with three MVPs at once and currently plays with another all star people are saying is having a MVP year. That would be three MVPs Westbrook could defer to when he has a bad game over his career. Get this nonsense post outta here.
they combine for one russell westbrook

Oh don't worry I've got a boatload more criticism for Magic than I do for LeBron. But honestly just pointing at counting stats is a really lazy way to evaluate how much a player is contributing to winning basketball. Example number 1: Russell Westbrook.
"Lol might as well just say Russell Westbrook has ""good"" efficiency because he's only 6 points below league average"
Russell Westbrook might win or lose a game by himself  Lebron James might make or break entire *seasons*
Russell westbrook from a year or two ago
Russell “Load Management” Westbrook 
"In one of the worst playing nights of his career, Russell Westbrook put up a near triple-double against one of the greatest teams of all time. Unless you think he's the GOAT dresser, this shouldn't really be a question you need to think much about.  Also: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/3892/files/prime_society_klay_thompson_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1552610767"
so should I just pretend that Russell Westbrook isn't basketball IQ challenged? and congratulate him for playing hard out there?
"Who's comparing careers? We're just talking about right now, how good is Russell Westbrook?"
Russell “Eric Cartman” Westbrook
to mock those who hate on russell westbrook for attention and karma? not all that hard to decipher with the /s
"Russell ""Elfrid Payton Lite"" Westbrook*"
"Triple double is a neat accolade, but it’s becoming just that.  Russell Westbrook does not play a winning brand of basketball on the offensive end. Give me cp3."
Russell Westbrook who?!
Jrue Holiday is not a better player than Russell Westbrook lol
Russell Westbrook not even the best Russell in the league right now. 
"russell 'elite playmaker' westbrook, ladies and gentlemen"
Russell Westbrook is singlehandedly winning the game for us.

"Per [Will Guillory of the Athletic](https://twitter.com/WillGuillory/status/1107090429676306432), the 4 other players with 4 triple-doubles in a row are Russell Westbrook, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and James Harden. Quite a crowd!"
Unpopular opinion: i like the nickname for Russell Westbrook as WB
Kevin Durant  Paul George  Stephen Curry  Anthony Davis  DeMar DeRozan  Russell Westbrook  Klay Thompson  Kyrie Irving  LeBron James  James Harden  Andre Drummond  Kawhi Leonard 
My guess:  * Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors) * Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) * Russell Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder) * Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers)  * James Harden (Houston Rockets) * Klay Thompson (Golden State Warriors)  * LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) * Kevin Durant (Golden State Warriors) * Paul George (Oklahoma City Thunder) * Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs)  * Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans) * DeMarcus Cousins (New Orleans Pelicans)
"&gt; I don't understand why it's considered a grave insult to Thunder fans to point that out.  Well, the Thunder are a mediocre team.  Despite 3 consecutive years of Russell Westbrook triple doubles, the team has never broken 50 wins or won a playoff series even though their fans would simultaneously argue that they have a MVP candidate besides Westbrook in Paul George and a borderline All-Star center in Steven Adams.  * If you don't accept that the Thunder's transition offense is good, then it doesn't make sense to funnel all these uncontested rebounds through him.   * If you don't funnel all those uncontested rebounds through him, then he's merely a double-double guy.   * If he's merely a double-double guy, he's really not all that special -- he's basically peak John Wall with worse shooting.  John Wall has made one All-NBA third team in his career.   * If he's not all that special, then you might have to think seriously about the future of a team where your point guard is playing a style of basketball that is empirically suboptimal, and where said point guard is owed 170M over the next 4 years. * Thunder fans don't want to do that.  So here we are, having this same discussion in every comment thread involving Westbrook even though the facts are basically clear as can be. "
"Athletic doesn’t just mean jump highest or run the fastest. You can have good footwork, great touch and balance and that’s athleticism. Not every athlete has to strive to be like Russell Westbrook"

&gt;Russell Westbrook  &gt;amazing efficiency  Pick one
Nah Lynx Titan is the Russell Westbrook of OSRS. amazing efficiency with stats no one can touch.
On a scale from 1-10 how much do you hate Russell Westbrook 
Russell Westbrook is a basketball player.
"Russell ""Bobby Scar"" Westbrook"
"That's a good point. Lebron has also consistently gotten fewer Offensive rebounds than Russell Westbrook, when he is 4-5 inches taller."
"&gt; VORP   http://prntscr.com/n8emps  VORP is literally just redefining BPM. The stats are fundamentally the same.  &gt;You rail against Westbrook for his counting stats, especially when it comes to BPM, but he actually averaged what he did on fewer minutes than Harden, averaging 5 more rebounds and 6 more points per 100 possessions or 3 more rebounds and 4 more points per 36 minutes. He was more productive when he was in and the drop off was greater when he came off the floor.  How is this relevant to anything I said. I said I don't value boxscore counting numbers. When you get credited for uncontested rebounds which russell westbrook led the league in and steals as an indicator of defense these are clearly not trustworthy figures. If you honestly think westbrook was an elite defender in 2016-17, then you're delusional.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYKolm75h8Y&amp;t=1s  &gt;And you completely missed my point about true shooting% and overall offensive officiency. While Harden was in good company, it alone wasn't enough to separate him from other non-bigs. Your whole argument is based on how efficient he   LOL. I love how you need to straw man me over and over. No. That is *not* my argument. *My* argument is that Harden was *far* more efficient than westbrook. This is something that you still have yet to admit that you were completely wrong about. I could care less that guys like lowry, curry and durant were more efficient because they *weren't* in the race.  Imagine needing to bring up an irrelevant player who happens to be the greatest shooter of all time to boost your hilarious defense of westbrook being mvp.  &gt; If you give it to Harden for efficiency, why wouldn't you give it to the more efficient Durant when the gap between him and Harden was similar to the gap between Harden and Westbrook?  Again, you completely changed the argument. *This* is about harden vs westbrook. Not Harden was other efficient scorers. You still haven't addressed the fact that your initial defense was that westbrook was almost as efficient as harden LOL. After I humiliated you, you completely ignored it and brought up other efficient scorers who were not in the race.  &gt;During that season, Westbrook's performance peaked after the all-star break, averaging 32.9/11/11.1 for their playoff push, with shooting splits of 43/35.2/88.8, an offensive rating of 117 and a defensive rating of 104. Harden averaged 28.7/7.8/10.9 with splits of 43.8/33.2/83.6, an offensive rating of 118 and defensive rating of 110. Also, Westbrook led 3 double digit comebacks in the final 2 months, including 2 separate 50 point triple doubles where he hit the game-tying or winning shot in regulation in the span of 2 weeks.  How is this an argument. I'm looking at the full picture.  29.1/8.1/11.2 vs 31.6/10.7/10.4 on far inferior efficiency and defense.  &gt;Westbrook's counting stats were in less playing time per game than Harden.  You don't get credited for minutes you didn't play.  &gt;Westbrook played much better than Harden on defense.  Yes by hunting for rebounds and contesting less threes than all players in the nba over 30 MPG except for whiteside and gobert LOL  &gt;James Harden's offense was efficient, but not transcendent, even when paring down to players with similar stats.  Irrelevant. Harden DESTROYED westbrook in efficiency which is all that matters because no one else was actually in the race.  &gt;Houston had a better record, but there were still better teams with similarly efficient MVP-caliber players.  Once again, the race is between westbrook and harden. IT and lebron won less games in the east on atrocious defense. Curry and durant canceled each other out. The only argument is leonard and I'm actually okay with him winning. That being said, the spurs never struggled with him off the floor because he wasn't the offensive force that harden was. But *once again*. This debate is about westbrook or harden. The fact that you discount efficiency and wins for the mvp race is hilarious just because there are other candidates. That's irrelevant. What matters is that westbrook didn't fit the criteria for MVP.   Now that you've been humiliated on every point again, I'm still waiting on you to address any of my points. It seems that whenever you make an awful argument you just ignore it and fail to acknowledge it. Here's a short list for you to look at.    &gt;Now that I'm out of work and able to spend more than 45 seconds on your spamming responses:  You realize that pretending to have work doesn't justify your hilarious stupidity right? It's not hard to wait to respond when you have time. Feeling the need to respond to my ""spam"" after humiliating you on every shit point you need wouldn't have been needed if you just waited to respond later. Calling someones logic spamming when all you did was post shitty argument after shitty argument is rather ironic.  &gt;His efficiency wasn't that much worse  Your initial defense lmao  &gt;That TS% put Harden behind Durant, Curry, Kyle ""Mike"" Lowry, Chris Paul, LeBron and IT among non-bigs with decent overall stats.  You try to discredit TS% because efficiency no longer fits your narrative by bringing up players not in the race. You did this with wins as well. *I know* you believe that wins and efficiency matter. You're simply desperately trying to find an escape out of this fact because it obviously doesn't favor your argument. Saying that curry had efficiency and wins doesn't change the fact that westbrook didn't have a case over harden.  &gt;If Harden was averaging just 29/10/6.5 this year, would he deserve MVP over Giannis?  Pulling numbers out of your ass in a completely irrelevant year to 2016-17  &gt;Oh, now I get it. An r/nba downvote troll. You actually had me believing someone thought this shit for a while there. Gj staying in character dude. Good times  Resort to calling someone a downvote troll after getting humiliated.   &gt;Dang dude, you're really committed. I'll go ahead and give you an A for effort  Ah yes just respond with nothing but insults.  You continue to prove how poor your debating skills are.  Whenever things don't go your way, you just resort to straw mans, redefine what you meant by what you said earlier, or flat out ignore it. You continue to get humiliated."
"Absolutely, box score doesn’t tell the whole story. Of course. But that’s not what many people are saying in this post, are they? They’re saying mostly that Westbrook doesn’t win and you have to win to be a great player. Even though it’s a team sport, that’s not unfair, but if that’s how you judge then seeing who the great players are isn’t hard because it’s just who wins. So, Harden is winning? Yeah, but Giannis is winning more. MVP debate over. Jordan won? Yeah but Russell won more. No GOAT debate possible.  And people will use box scores to indicate that Wilt is in the conversation for greatest player ever because his raw numbers are ridiculous. 25 rebounds per game for a whole season? Incredible. Try to bring up what his rebounding percentage was and how it’s lower than the best rebounders today or in other eras? They don’t want to hear it.  I’m not trying to make the argument that Westbrook is the best player in the league just because he’s done something no one else has done. But when you’ve done something that people celebrate, or even that they simply praise other players for (“LeBron has to make an all nba team, he averaged 28/8/8” “yeah but on a losing team” “doesn’t matter, look at those numbers!”) but Westbrook gets hate for it? It’s a bunch of hypocritical bullshit. "
"Russell Westbrook could rape/pillage all of OKC to the ground and OKC fans would say ""like what did you expect him to do? The man had zero help and not shooters. and By the way he raped 10 women, killed 14 men, and stole 13 horses so it's not like he wasn't productive lol."""
&gt;How is this comment being upvoted at all? This dude just tried to compare Russell Westbrook to Draymond Green.  Thank you for the long winded explanation as to why he's wrong/incorrect/off-target here. 
You're not going to just tank on a team with Russell Westbrook and Paul George lol 
"Can you please point out, with a direct quote, where at any point in this discussion, including the original post, I made the argument that Russell Westbrook is the greatest teammate of all time? Please. I'm begging you. Find one instance in which I said he's the GTOAT.  I'm asking other people for their opinions. By attempting to undermine my intelligence, you have revealed your own lack thereof, as if you would have read OP, you'd know that I **don't** think he's the GTOAT.  Learn to read."
"How dare you compare me, the great Russell Westbrook, to possibly the greatest point guard to ever play the game!"
"""that's some russell Westbrook."""
"Russ is in my top 3 must watch on tv players. It’s always a treat watching him play and hustle. His athleticism, skill and passion is unmatched. He’s really turned a leaf and grown into the best version of Russell Westbrook. As much as I want the Knicks to get KD I would love if he went to OKC to play with this Russ. "
Didn't even have to watch it to know it'd be Russell Westbrook doing a pass! ⌚
All you motherfuckers hating on Westbrook better not ever quote anyone’s box score stats ever. If it’s all about wins then it’s all about wins and that’s all that matters. And you better all have Bill Russell as the greatest player ever on your lists or you’re fucking hypocrites. And your MVP’s better all be Giannis this year because he’s winning more than anyone else. 
How do you start an offense when Paul George is cold and you are Russell Westbrook? You have no shooters on your team so spacing is terrible and Westbrook simply has to force things a lot of the time 
Congrats to Russell Westbrook for 3-straight triple-double seasons and 3-straight sub 50 win seasons.

He had the most efficient high volume scoring season in league history while playing in a dysfunctional offensive system with a head-coach who literally became a meme for his inability to coach offense, a point guard that took the name of his position literally, and a lineup starting the scattered remains from the corpse of Kendrick Perkins at center. Oh they also traded away their 2nd best scorer and a future MVP that offseason.     Yet OKC somehow actually improved and ended up with the best offense in the league and a top 30 offensive rating all time thanks in large part to Durant, who's +11.2% relative TS ranked as the highest ever for a high-volume scorer(league average 53.5, KD 64.7).  His WSp48 was top 20 all time. His Win Share total was 12th best all time. He became the 7th player in history to join the 50/40/90 club and only the 2nd to do it averaging 25+ ppg(Bird)          Defensively they were also elite(ranked 4th), particularly in the paint as KD developed into a legitimate rim protector and combined with Ibaka to form the best shot blocking duo in the league. OKC ended up blocking the 2nd most shots in regular season history and KD became just the 4th player to ever block 100 shots, have 100 steals, and make 100 3's in a season.   OKC ended the season with the 7th best MOV in NBA History behind only the 92, 96, 97 Bulls, 86, 08 Celtics and 87 Lakers, all 6 of which are widely considered among the best ever. Their SRS, 9.21, ranked 5th highest only behind those Bulls teams and the 08 Celtics.       Durant had an all time great regular season, his team won 60 games, and were ranked by most advanced metrics as one of the top 10-15 regular season teams of all time, which is pretty remarkable when looking at their roster as it was mostly a bunch of specialists and/or role players with major deficiencies in their game.     |Rk||Age|G|MP|FG%|3P%|FT%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PTS/G|TS%| |:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Russell Westbrook|24|82|34.9|.438|.323|.800|5.2|7.4|1.8|0.3|3.3|23.2|.532|   |5|Thabo Sefolosha|28|81|27.5|.481|.419|.826|3.9|1.5|1.3|0.5|0.8|7.6|.617| |4|Serge Ibaka|23|80|31.1|.573|.351|.749|7.7|0.5|0.4|3.0|1.6|13.2|.612|   |5|Kendrick Perkins|28|78|25.1|.457|.000|.611|6.0|1.4|0.6|1.1|1.4|4.2|.479|   |9|Reggie Jackson|22|70|14.2|.458|.231|.839|2.4|1.7|0.4|0.2|0.8|5.3|.531| |4|Kevin Martin|29|77|27.7|.450|.426|.890|2.3|1.4|0.9|0.1|1.3|14.0|.608| |7|Nick Collison|32|81|19.5|.595|.000|.769|4.1|1.5|0.6|0.4|0.9|5.1|.624| |8|Derek Fisher|38|24|14.4|.333|.351|.933|0.9|0.7|0.6|0.0|0.5|4.1|.478|      Durant's season would have won MVP in the vast majority of other NBA seasons, with a handful of exceptions being some peak years by Jordan, LeBron, Shaq, Wilt, Kareem, and maybe a couple by Bird/Magic. It was right on the verge of being an all time great regular season, yet not only did he not win MVP, he didn't get a single 1st place vote.        Note: Keep in mind that raw stats even from the early 2010's aren't easily comparable to today as scoring was far more difficult and the league was far more defensive minded. Pace of play was much slower, which mean reduced scoring/rebounding/assist opportunities and shooting efficiency was substantially lower in comparison with these last 3 years as today's 8 second offense has replaced defensive effort in the regular season.

"I was scrolling through my home feed and for some reason I read Russell Westbrook as Russell Wilson. I spent a solid 2 minutes trying to figure out how Russell Wilson could get a triple double. ""I guess its possible that the seahawks could bring him in to kick a field goal at some point, but the odds that he signs with an nba team and drops a triple double seems much lower than 44.9%. Maybe OP is referring to some type of football triple double? Yards, completions, touchdowns? Nah theres no way you could get double digit touchdowns. And yards would probably be a triple digit number anyway"". This was my actual thought process. "
"Leading your team to an above average offense, not taking 20 shots a game when you shoot like shit, making better decisions.  When people talk about “pure PGs” they talk about the likes of Chris Paul, not Russell fucking Westbrook.  Harden led the league in assists in 2017, should we call him a pure PG too?

"&gt; I'm pretty open-minded to changing my mind in light of new evidence, but I don't think you could convince me that Russell Westbrook is not a great player.  Never said he wasn't. I disputed your point about how having the point guard take the rebound is actually beneficial to fastbreak scoring. I've shown (through the relevant statistic) that the Thunder are one of the very worst at getting fasbreak points efficiently.  It's basketball orthodoxy to have the forwards take the rebound on defense while peremiter players box out outside (or on more aggressive teams, leak forward). Is it not possible that a change of tactics here will actually improve the Thunder's ability to execute fastbreak opportunities?"

[Russell Westbrook sets up Adams for the jam before coming back on the next trip to cut-dribble and spin into the over-the-head no-look pass for a second Adams slam](https://streamable.com/4z806)  
"I don't understand why people think Adams sometimes boxing out for Westbrook to get the board is the bad thing. The Thunder are consistently one of the best rebounding teams in the leagues and this isn't really done for stats, but to kickstart transition offense. WB is often inefficient on offense, but he can get super hot, he makes his teammates better by attacking and drawing multiple defenders on pretty much every play by attacking the rim or sometimes posting up, and making great passes. He's also been shooting better recently. He isn't technically one of the most efficient passers based on AST/TO ratio, but he makes his teammates better and is  a great passer nonetheless. The Thunder win 82% of the time WB gets a triple double, and I think that is the biggest argument against the ""Russell is a selfish stat-padder"" argument. Also, if you don't think his 20-21-20 stat-line while dominating the game the other night in honor of the fallen rapper Nipsey Hussle and his gang the Rolling 60's, is legendary, then I just don't know what to tell you."
Russell Westbrook has beef with every single human being not wearing a Thunder jersey 
Been really gone since the notorious “Russell Westbrook outta his cotton pickin mind” comment.
Oscar Robertson did it for the first time back in 1962. No other player could do it in the next 55 years. And then Russell Westbrook did it in 2017. And then again in 2018. And then again in 2019.
Russell Westbrook is a point guard but would brick everything if he was a shooting guard.

"Steph Curry, James Harden  Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving  Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson  I think all those guys definitely deserve it over him. Mike Conley, Ben Simmons, and Donovan Mitchell have good arguments over him too. I think you're right."
Depends on who else is on the team because you’re asking to pick between Kyle Korver and Russell Westbrook. The first guy would be a great role player. The second guy better play damn good defense.

My Top Picks  Starters..  PG- Russell Westbrook Good Actor in Commercials.. High Energy. Triple Double scenes would be funny.  SG- James Harden. Some underrated commercials. The Beard. The Stepback. You should include him.  Forward- Blake Griffin. Good Actor. Great Personality as in the Dunk Contest.   Forward- Lebron. It's his movie. Can't leave him out or else he'll join The Monstars.  Center- Joel Embiid. Very hilarious guy. The funniest young player in the league.

Maybe but the decision making of Russell Westbrook in the GS series just shows that he doesn’t have the mental aspect in check for a PG that’s trying to compete for a championship. Winning on the highest level isn’t just about putting the ball in the hoop it’s about thinking critically throughout the game

Salute to RUSSELL WESTBROOK a.k.a Mr. Triple double
You're then one making the huge exaggeration.     Player| Uncontested REB per game| Uncontested REB % ---|---|---- Russell Westbrook| 9.0| 83.9 Giannis Antetokounmpo| 8.6| 68.5 Deandre Jordan| 8.6| 65.6 Ben Simmons| 6.4| 72.2 LeBron James| 6.3| 75.3 Luka Doncic| 5.7| 73.5 James Harden| 5.0| 78.7 DeMar DeRozan| 4.9| 81.9 Victor Oladipo| 4.5| 79.8 Jimmy Butler| 3.3| 62.2 Stephen Curry| 4.2| 79.2  Do you see a pattern here? Russell Westbrook is one of the best guard rebounders in the league but his double digit rebounds are clearly inflated by the far higher than average number of uncontested rebounds he is gobbling up. It's OKC's strategy for him to do that. That doesn't make him some rebounding god. Plenty of guards could average high numbers of rebounds if their teams told them to do the same.  
"The Lakers might actually have to trade for someone and not just say that Russell Westbrook is coming in free agency.  Then, PG is coming.  Good lord, they have been after OKC players for a while and trying to get them for free."
"Riiight like there aren't teams that are dumpster fires outside of one or two players? Westbrook pre-PG, LeBron on the Lakers, Booker and Russell could try to put up those numbers on near 40% usage, but they'd be pretty fucking inefficient and hurt their teams.   MacLean's comment was asinine. "

"I guess I'm just frustrated by yours. You brought up Dame being 1st-team All NBA last year, but Westbrook's done it twice.

Russell was 2nd team all nba his 2nd year, Dame was only 3rd.   I just feel like we're comparing apples and oranges, and you're relying on recency bias, whereas I'm looking at their careers as a whole. There's nothing to suggest Westbrook's efficiency won't recover a bit, and it's just pure speculation about which one will last in the league longer.   So I guess here are the arguments I'll make:  Westbrook's peak &gt; Dame's peak  Westbrook's best 5 years at the same age &gt; Dame's best 5 years at the same age  Westbrook's career so far &gt;&gt;&gt; Dame's career so far  And the part I'd need to do more research for is whether or not Westbrook creates more for his team, but from my preliminary observation of the data he has more assists, a higher assist percentage, a higher steal percentage, and better statistics age 22-28 (the entire time Dame's been in the league). "
"What is negative is I think the players have been and still are coddled so much that they can’t take any chirps from the crowd and the Jazz banning those fans only perpetuates the victim mentality that these MULTIMILLIONAIRE ATHLETES have. It’s just ridiculous. Russell Westbrook is a prick, he wants attention yet treats the media like shit, and he just is an angry person filled with hatred who threatened to “fuck up” a fan and his wife. He did it even after his teammates told him to chill out. And he has a track record of being a dick. He did it just because he can. His ego is out of control.   Donovan Mitchell is very young and doesn’t know his ass from a hole in the ground so what he said should not be seen as gospel. "
At least he didn’t go all Russell Westbrook on him.
"Really? Show me where it gets “personal”:  &gt; MEMPHIS, Tenn. – Joey Crawford came sprinting at Kevin Durant, blowing a whistle and waving arms and the bright lights of Chesapeake Arena shining off Crawford’s bald head, and Durant surely must have thought only one thing.  &gt; No sanctuary even at the foul line. Even with the clock stopped, Tony Allen sends a demon to bedevil the NBA’s presumptive most valuable player.  &gt; Allen is inside Durant’s head. Durant is dazed and confused. Hesitant and docile. The Memphis Doberman has turned Durant into mere mortal this Western Conference playoff series. The Thunder is on the brink of elimination, and if Durant doesn’t return to something approaching the Slim Reaper in Game 6 Thursday night, Grim Sleeper is going to be more like it.  &gt; Durant has made just 40 percent of his shots against the Grizzlies. Allen’s been in Durant’s sneakers. Meets him at the bus and tucks him in at night. Then haunts Durant’s dreams.  &gt; Don’t believe it? Durant is so out of sorts, he’s not making hay even when Allen is on the bench charming teammates with his mercurial ways. The last two games, Durant has made just eight of 20 shots with Allen not in the game. Durant is so out of sorts, his foul shooting is mediocre — 28 of 39, a .718 percentage that is below NBA journeyman standards, much less Durant’s own .882 career percentage.  &gt; Durant went to the foul line three times – and made just one of two on all three trips, including a miss after Crawford’s interruption, when the Thunder trailed 100-99 with 27.5 seconds left in overtime, a score that held up at the end. For six years, Durant has shot foul shots on a string. Mister Automatic. Now he’s unreliable.  &gt; All because the mighty Memphis defense, led by Allen, has knocked Durant from his moorings.  &gt; “Obviously we’re trying to make his catches tough, and if we could make it so he never got to touch the ball, I certainly would,” Memphis coach Dave Joerger said. “Our guys did a good job, not just the guys who were guarding him, but the guys who were supporting the guys who were guarding him.”  &gt; Durant was not available for interviews Wednesday but said after the game Tuesday, “I just gotta stay disciplined in my shots and knock them down. Stay aggressive and stay positive.”  &gt; Trouble is, Durant’s aggression and positive attitude come and go. His shoulders have dipped repeatedly during rough stretches of this streetfight. His effort is spotty. His confidence is shaken.  &gt; That’s not appropriate for a 25-year-old superstar. A 21-year-old star? Sure. When Durant made just 35 percent of his shots in that six-game Laker series in 2010, we knew it was growing pains. Knew that Durant was being hounded by Ron Artest, the Tony Allen of yesteryear, a guy who sold out to defense and could stage Les’ Miserables for even the sharpest of shooters.  &gt; But that was four years ago. Allen is a beast, but the Thunder has to get better production from Durant. This is not a team built to take up the slack elsewhere. Sure, a Reggie Jackson 32-point game can fall out of the sky. But count on that too many times, and it’s happy trails for the Thunder.  &gt; “I’ve seen great players have poor playoff games,” said Super Vet Derek Fisher. “That happens, in terms of shot percentages. But what can’t dip down is that undying sense of urgency, every play, every situation is the most important one.”  &gt; Fisher says the Thunder can’t lay this series all on Durant or even Russell Westbrook. But Fisher is wrong. This Thunder team was not built to sustain off days from its stars. This Thunder team is fueled by Durant and Westbrook. One or the other, preferably both, have to play at a high level.  &gt; If both struggle, nothing else matters. The Thunder is cooked.  &gt; This is a historic series in more ways than just the four straight overtimes, which might never be equaled. This series is becoming an historically bad series for the presumptive MVP. And it doesn’t speak well for the Thunder future.  &gt; The Durant and Michael Jordan career ascensions often are compared. For good reason. Not that Durant is or will be the player that Jordan was, but that Durant is progressing, growing, learning and hopefully developing into the champion that Jordan became.  &gt; Except at age 26, his fifth season in the NBA, Jordan led his Bulls to the 1989 Eastern Conference Finals. Durant, at 25, is in his seventh pro season. Chicago ran into the Detroit Pistons, the Bad Boys of recent 30-for-30 fame. Those Pistons were one of the great defensive teams of all time and one of the toughest. They dispatched the Bulls and went on to the NBA title. In 1990, same script. Detroit beat Chicago for the East crown and also won the NBA. In 1991, it was Jordan’s time. The Bulls swept the Pistons, then Chicago won the first of its six NBA titles.  &gt; Three straight Eastern Conference showdowns for Jordan against Joe Dumars and Friends.  &gt; In ’89, Jordan shot 46 percent from the field and averaged 29.7 points. In ’90, 46.7 percent and 32.1 points a game. In ’91, 53.5 percent from the field and 29.8 points a game.  &gt; Jordan, even while paying his championship dues, was the bedeviler. So far in this Memphis series, Durant is the bedeviled.   This is totally fair IMO. That was his mvp season and they were struggling in a series they needed to win. "
Do those problems begin with not being able to spell Russell Westbrook or Blake Griffin correctly?

"Sure, but the concern was “one game isn’t a season” for Russell Westbrook, when, outside of garbage shooting efficiency, Westbrook has had yet another actually historic season. Last night was historic, but it’s becoming so common for him that people dismiss it or think of it as a one-off success."

"So would I but that's kinda the thing we're never gonna get it.   Maybe it's because Berry has done enough legitimately shitty things to him he's just completely done with him.   Maybe it's because RW just thinks ""It's the media their a bunch of nobodies Im not actually going to waste time thinking about or talking about some guy I don't like. Im above that dude anyway"".   Best guess is its somewhere in the middle. Thing Ill say in Berry's credit is he's always been above putting the blame directly on RW with this [many quotes like this in the past: ""could have been from Syracuse for the way he acted,” Tramel said. “[But] that’s not really Russ’s fault, I don’t think.

"I looove Dominique!!! Probably one of the most underrated players in history.  If you were a fan in the late 80's &amp; early 90's you know he was always viewed as a top 5 player in the league. This was just assumed.....and also in a league included prime Jordan, Bird, Magic, Hakeem, Malone, &amp; Barkley. Him &amp; MJ were considered the 2 best wings &amp; overall players, with legit arguments for which player you'd rather have on your team, etc...  His game was incredible. He had the sheer explosive athletic power &amp; speed--and played with a similar kind of attacking &amp; aggressive pressure of--Russell Westbrook, but in a 6'8 frame &amp; with the personality of a basketball nerd/junkie. He beat whoever tried to so him because he was physically &amp; mentally better at basketball than you were. A totally polished basketball player in every way.  I like to think what the game would have been like if he would have been like if he would have played for the Jazz. I think he would've been the biggest star on a super-team that would've spent the late 80's &amp; early 90' making Finals runs &amp; given us multiple epic finals battles between Wilkins &amp; Jordan.  Crazy how instead, he's not even a consensus pick for top 50 player all-time after being arguably the best player in a league with Jordan, Magic &amp; Bird."

"What does point differential mean? Team differential?  Russell Westbrook was assisted 17% of the FGM. By comparison, Devin Booker, you know the guy without a point guard on the worst team in the league, was assisted nearly 30% of his FGM and led the league in assists. I'm all for bagging on him but he's one of the best players in the league."

OKC will never win anything with Russell Westbrook.  These are facts.   PG is learning this the hard way now that he's signed on long term.     The biggest issue is that PG wanted to play for the Lakers but they never made him a realistic offer once it became known that Kawhi Leonard was going to be available the next year.  Sucks for PG but now he's stuck. They need to for Billy Donovan first and then get a coach that can reign in Westbrook.  It's their only chance

"&gt; Last year Dame was swept from the playoffs and was filled with loathing and faced incredible adversity. He could have rolled over and died but instead he humbly worked on his game. He refined it and molded it into him becoming easily the second best point guard in the league with a solid case for being number one. Russell Westbrook has also faced adversity. Once Kevin Durant stabbed him in the back and the heart simultaneously, he had all of the good will in the world. All he did was squander it by refusing to become a true leader and setting up a culture toxicity. It's no surprise he has such ardent defenders in this day and age since he reflects many of the things that's wrong with this society. The selfishness, the rudeness, the lack of emotional control, the big talk without backing it up (does this sound like someone you know? A certain politician perhaps?) etc.- it's all there. When people see him, they see themselves and revel in his loser mentality because losers love company. Winners that play the right way that actually deserve this kind of over the top reverence, like Tim Duncan, are relegated to afterthoughts. I hope this series helps move the NBA (and maybe, just maybe society) into a better place. In a world of Westbrooks, be a Lillard."
"Disagree. Loved what dame did.   Game 1 and 2 the trailblazers shit on the thunder, No Sore winner acts, no showboating Nothing. Game 3, thunder win and PG is dunking at the end for no reason and the rest of the thunder are taunting like crazy. Also before the series Russell has trashtalked Damian in the past and got all in his face and other unnecessary shit  Now after winning and being the better team, the calm but wave goodbye was nice revenge for Dame, he deserves it after the whole thunder were cocky as shit after winning 1 single game but still down in the series. They got that gentlemans sweep. Damian may not always be the better player then westbrook (he is better then him currently) but he will always be the more mature and coolheaded individual out of them"

"Neither of your points are what I'm saying.  Stay within the hypothetical question that was posed:  &gt;Would you rather have DJ Augustin for one more year at 7.5 million or Russell Westbrick for four more years at around 42 million per?  Yes, I would rather have DJ because I'd have money to get a fuller and more well-rounded team together (or at least a player that would be a better use of 35 mil).  To the second bit:  &gt;If you are inferring that Thunder should not have signed Westbrook to the supermax, that’s asinine. Westbrook is the heart of this team, and this team would be pretty much nothing if it wasn’t for his contributions.  Not was I was inferring at all.  Thunder is in a tough spot in that they need to keep the money coming in and Westbrook at this point *is* the Thunder and main attraction so they rolled out the cash cart for him (as they should've).  That and they certainly don't want to be known as the franchise that didn't keep a championship contending team together by not retaining Harden, then Durant and now WB.  Whether or not the Thunder should or shouldn't have re-signed WB is immaterial to the question.  The question wasn't,""WHat was the best option for the Thunder?"" the question was,""Which would you rather have, WB or DJ?""  Although, I would like to counter this:  &gt;and this team would be pretty much nothing if it wasn’t for his contributions.  Team is pretty much nothing *with* his contributions too so I mean..?

We got nothing to trade away, we're over the luxury tax, and we're right in the middle of the pack and our guys are getting older.  I'm looking over at Jamal Murray and Jokic and I'm so jealous.  None of this is Russell Westbrook's fault. He's playing with what he's got. He hates losing, he plays hard, he passes the ball more than ever before. He's just got nothing to work with.  Parl George is obviously a superstar but after that, what? Steven Adams, making 24 million, can't make a damn 8 foot post up shot in the lane when it matters.  Everybody just says Pesti is a great GM because it's like some sort of truth that was spoken into existence, but is he really?  Everyone wanted Durant, he's a great GM because Portland took Oden? He traded Ray Allen for what became Jeff Green while Ray went on to win 2 more chips. He hit on Russ and Harden but then gave James away because he wanted Ibaka more. Russ looks overpaid heading into his 30's. Steven Adams is definitely overpaid. Russ kept PG in town not Pesti.  So is he really a great GM? The Thunder don't have enough to keep up and have nowhere to go and are maxed out."

If either has a good scoring game, their teammates typically struggle, and vice versa, and I think that's telling.  No off ball, cant work together with his sidekick other than just taking turns on offense, poor shot selection (dame literally only looks for tough shots, while russ keeps taking and bricking the open shots the d gives him), both play iso hero ball in the clutch with poorly thought out rushes to the basket or tough deep threes (open ones that he cant hit, in russ's case) that waaay too often result in turnovers or bricks.  No way they're beating a team with a coach that actually has control over his players (not billy donovan).  Thanks for coming to my TED Talk"
"We CAN win a title with Russell Westbrook, but we cannot win a title with Westbrook’s current play style. I do agree that I think it’s time for Billy Donovan to go.   Also, I’m really getting annoyed by the Russell Westbrook hate circlejerk on this subreddit. Bunch of karma whores."
Dry but my heart required cpr couldn't stop laughing at Westbrook getting his head chopped off GOT style. People are forgetting Russell took the first gaming winning shot. IT WAS A LAYUP
"lol no. Enes Kanter was able to look good because it’s russell Westbrook, he cant shoot and kanter dropped to the paint. Let’s see kanter defend harden on a switch, even Chris Paul will murder him. We’d beat Portland in 5"
That Russell Westbrook is anything other than a worse Monta Ellis
"wow you motivated KD and his crew to get the ring? maybe you can chat with Russell Westbrook and his crew next lol #striveforgreatness      i didn't like KD until he left OKC and found better teammates. joined the bandwagon right when he was peaking. as a fan, i just want to watch great basketball, not get caught up in all the butthurt drama"
"Same, I feel a bit like Thanos. Fun isn't something one considers when balancing Russell Westbrook. But this... does put a smile on my face."
"Russell Westbrook invited a few people to his home for dinner on Monday night to watch Game 4 of the first-round series between the Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets.  For several minutes, the Oklahoma City Thunder’s star guard sat quietly on his sofa, chowing down on fried catfish, red beans and rice, and broccoli. And then suddenly, he spoke: “I’m getting a triple-double tomorrow.”"
"I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns. This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd. And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist. I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
"I know you’re used to journalists who are Russell Westbrook fan boys, but I really don’t care if he is critical of your sports team.  It’s not a writers job to tell you how awesome everything is.   How he dare besmirch the name of Oklahoma state cowboy basketball?"
And how is this still relevant?  Especially with today’s spacing.  Russell Westbrook doesn’t have a consistent jumper and is still extremely successful.  MJ would still dominate period.
Youre crazy for that.    R.W:  PPG: 22.8 Reb:8.8 Ast: 10.6 Stl: 1.0 TOV: 4.6 FG: 36% 3P: 32% Net Rating (Off-Def)= (99-111=-12ppg)  Per: 16.3.

TS%: 58.3%  Paul George was clearly the superior player the only thing that i would truly say that he was disappointing of him in the series was his 3PT shot. Other than that there wasnt much more you could ask outta of him. He was the more composed player of the two and seemed like the more mature one even though Russell has 2/3 more years in the league than him.   Westbrook brought his team down by -12ppg in comparison with George at -2ppg.
He has Russell Westbrook on his team. That's the problem
"Yeah in 20 years people will look back and think ""holy shit Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for 3 seasons.""  No one will care about how he treated the media at that point."
This is a backdoor Russell Westbrook post isn't it?
Damian Lillard .000000001  Russell Westbrook 9999999
"Meanwhile, two years previous.  Russell Westbrook may not be great at basketball but he can travel. Through time!"
Westbrook isn't forced into those shots. He's well known for wanting to control the office and not participating in the game off the ball. WB takes bad shots all the time - he took a pull-up 3 on a fast break last night. A Fast Break. With Russell Westbrook. He shot a 3.  He does stuff like that all the time. Russ deserves all the criticism he is getting right now. Very little of it is unfair. He makes bad decisions. He won't operate without the ball. He tries to force it on both ends. And he refuses to acknowledge his bad shooting. He's exciting at his best and a 1st round exit at his worst
"Yeah we were always here, just now our opinion gets upvoted instead of downvoted. The Russel has a low BBIQ takes exist [ever since he took shots away from the best scorer in the game](https://giphy.com/gifs/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-thunder-12OYYarAi8vi8)."
&gt; He is disrespectful with everyone but his family   You call [this](https://sports.yahoo.com/russell-westbrook-keeps-giving-away-sneakers-thunder-games-191827955.html) disrespectful?
"Exactly. They're MUCH better than KD having Roberson, Waiters, younger Adams, Nick fucking Collison, Kyle Singler and the rest of that trash outside of Ibaka and Adams.  &amp;#x200B;  You simply replaced Russell Westbrook with KD and have Dennis at #1 and this OKC is the best team in not only the West, but the NBA--even with Boogie still on the Warriors.  &amp;#x200B;  But you guys are so hellbent on hating KD you won't acknowledge this"
"Russell's mentality is trash, no one should question his talent and ability though  PG is 14/20 and has been clutch the whole season, yet Westbrook thinks chucking it 31 times to try to match Dame is the winning play... this shit goes back to 2012 with KD  Russell Westbrook ain't never getting anywhere if he continues down this path"
"I'm too lazy to format:  * https://twitter.com/molly_knight/status/1120779576320221185  * http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/   The actions he took was playing like trash and then being rude reporters. When they can't write about of his performance and he doesn't give them anything about his personality, what else is there to write about?   Russ has a history of giving non answers, unfortunately for him ""Next Question"" is an amazing catchphrase that ESPN and TNT can take advantage of. And if a player talks and can't back it up, he's going to get clowned, that's how this works. Now that it has made national news there is also more serious discussion on how answers like ""next question"" can be damaging for the league (I prefer the athletic story but it's behind a paywall): https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/04/22/steve-kerr-calls-russell-westbrooks-treatment-media-dangerous-nba/?utm_term=.f92b0fca85d5  Also, call me crazy, but I think it's not hard for players to be respectful to the media. Russ doesn't act like that just towards Tramel, he acts like that to people like Molly Knight who wanted to write something that would benefit his brand."
"Easily. KD with PG at 2 and Grant at 4 without Russell Westbrook is the best defensive team in the league and he doesn't have to worry about chucker like Westbrook squandering things like Russ did at the end of the game last night. (I still don't understand why he drove against their best perimeter defender in Aminu like that and forced up that layup)  &amp;#x200B;  They've essentially replaced him with PG from that 2016 team (instead they have a better back-up PG in Shroeder' a better shooter at the #2 in Ferguson, unlike Roberson who if you remember refused to shoot the ball with the shot clock winding down at the end of Game 7 which got KD heated; a more dynamic #4 in Grant than Ibaka; and although Kanter was great for them, he was eventually schemed out of the series because Kerr kept exploiting his defense in pick-and-roll situations), and yet they still can't make it past the first round.  &amp;#x200B;  A lot of these guys are LeBron fan boys who are upset that KD ended up ruining his chances of eclipsing MJ (GTFOH with that you're upset that KD going to GS meant that your team had no chance to win, as if if you rooted for any team other than GS, Cavs, Rockets and the Spurs you had any chance of even winning the title regardless of if KD stayed in OKC), but it definitely adds to his legacy. That's THREE straight years of this guy not progressing pass the first."
Russell Westbrook looks like the type of guy who returns his tapes to Blockbuster without rewinding them.
"Because Russell Westbrook III got a triple double and Billy Donovan didn't put up any stats? Like do you not see the three double-digit numbers on Russ' stat sheet? Like it's clear Donovan is telling Russ ""hey keep shooting that stupid ass pull-up long 2 you rarely make and wasting possessions, that's exactly what a point guard is supposed to do."""
"Yeah you also live with going home in the first round again, and the cancer that is Russell Westbrook too. Let him triple double you right out of the playoffs again. Bet you’re glad you took that contract to stay in OKC."
Imagine having to pay Russell Westbrook ~42 million for the next four seasons for him to chuck his way to four more first round exits.
"You could also frame tha In one year playing with Russell Westbrook, Oladipo became an All NBA Leve gaurd. Oladipo gave Russ a lot of credit for helping him improve and make the jump to that next level"
&gt;Props to not making major overreactions to the small postseason sample sizes  &gt;Excludes Russell Westbrook from the list
"My boy Russell Westbrook, just last year we were considering changing r/nba to r/russellwestbrook and now we're here."
"I mean he celebrated his ass off during his one good game, he just hasn't played well enough to warrant celebrating in any other game. He definitely comes from the Westbrook school of celebrating though, just doesnt get as offended as Russell does when it happens to him."
"He's been quiet cause he has played like ass for every game besides 3, and in that one game he celebrated more than half the shots he made. He for sure comes from the Russell Westbrook school of thought when it comes to celebrating.  That being said he is a much better sport compared to Russell when he is losing. When he is winning though he really cant contain himself at all and will pull a celebration out for every single shot he makes. His lows arent quite as low as Westbrooks, but his highs certainly are just as high."
"&gt;After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years.

That’s he played better than Russell Westbrook in the playoffs and seems likely to be a better team player
Let me tell you about a guy name Mr. Russell Westbrook
"probably most entertaining PG.  though Jason Williams comes to mind - he did it differently.  other positions though, Kemp, Jordan.  its tough.  most explosive PG?  he's what comes to mind, even over Westbrook(Russell has a inch or few in height on Rose I presume)"
why is his name Brodie? how do you get Brodie from Russell or Westbrook?
"I brought up the windmill and the celebration after because that's the one thing I've seen Raptors fans bring up the most. The airplane and the crowd hype motion came literally right after the dunk.  No offense, but it just seems weird. What got you to respect Embiid all this time if something like this is what changes your opinion? Embiid has been ""King of Shit Mountain"" for a long time now.  Dunking on Donovan Mitchell, staring him down, and then drawing the shove and the tech? Waving bye to Russell Westbrook after he fouled out? Asking ""whose man is this"" and pointing to Willis Reed? The list goes on and on and on."
"Russell Westbrook is awful defensively, he made Dame look like a superstar. They had to switch Russ off him cause he kept getting burned."
"Russell Westbrook has the better career, but if even the biggest Russ Stan in the world should Dame is the better player now. They literally had five games to prove who was superior and it wasn’t even close.(Thunder fan btw)"
Here's a top 10 since you lot are too cowardly to put a real opinion.  Curry  Harden  Lillard  Westbrook  Kemba  Simmons  Russell  Conley  He might squeeze in ahead of Paul and Murray.
"Really? He might not have a top-10 contarct in the laegue, but are there actually 10 point guards who you could swap him for and improve the team?  Curry, Lillard sure. Chris Paul, probably (I'm into CP3), Kyrie probably. Jrue if he's a PG (but he's really not). Conley and Walker have arguments but I wouldn't take that swap for this team (maybe other teams would prefer them). Westbrook? Maybe, but the fit isn't amazing. Bledsoe? That's pushing it. Rubio, Jackson, Simmons, Russell? No, no, no, no. Beverly, Smart, Rubio, Collison, Murray? Pass on all of them.  Honestly, there are only 4 (5 if you count Jrue) PGs who are better than him. 3 who are arguable (*maybe* 4). But he's at worst the 10th best PG in the league, and really I think he's 5th."
"These guys are all better: Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Westbrook, Kemba, Harden, Paul, Simmons, (Conley cause i'm a homer)   He'd be on par with Murray, Russell, Bledsoe, Holiday."
I mean Lebron has kicked it with Drake on numerous occasions. People are built differently and can dedicate head space to different things lol.   Oh and here's WB dancing at a Drake concert https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/10/19/russell-westbrook-drake-concert-los-angeles-migos-tour/
"This marks the second knee surgery in the last year for Russell Westbrook, along with the finger surgery. It also means that in addition to the knee and elbow surgery PG had last summer, here a year later he's had both shoulders operated on. That's in addition to the 3-4 knee surgeries that Andre Roberson has had in the last 18 months. What the hell is going on down there in OKC?"
Imagine if Harden and KD were on the same team.... and Russell Westbrook took more shots than either of them.  ;-)
Young tweets on Reddit get me every damn time.  Young Russell Westbrook....  I'll learn one day.
"Placing KD in a situation where he went from having Westbrook and Roberson to provide spacing for him to Steph and Klay was always going to improve his efficiency. Just like if he went to the Blazers and had Dame/McCollum, or the Nets with Russell/Levert.  The issue in OKC was always the fact that they did a poor job of addressing the poor spacing that they had for KD (this didn't impact Russ as severely because KD was his sole floor spacer).  You place KD on the Rockets or the Bucks and he'll put up his numbers, probably even more so since he'll have the ball in his hands more and the court will be spaced 1 thru 4/5 (in the Bucks case), and not just 1 thru 2, as Iguodala and Draymond still clog up the lane there in GS."
Now I know why Russell Westbrook doesn't talk to reporters.

I would rather have Kemba than Russell Westbrook right now
"Playoffs % before injury 70.1 TS% (63.4 TS% in Game 1), after injury 49.0 TS% (basically Russell Westbrook). I don't think you can blame it 100% obviously but it still looks [pretty swollen as of pre game 4.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D559HWLX4AcgEwW.jpg)"
"Id say this place doesnt actually flip that much. Its just that when you have a “Russell Westbrook Bad” like thread, all the westbrook haters crawl out of the woodworks and throw their upvotes  Every individual thread is like its own echo chamber sometimes"
"Flawed logic. You can get that many assists &amp; still ball-stop by only looking for plays you get assist credited for, rather than the ""hockey assist/extra pass"" etc. Russell Westbrook is a prime example of this."
This happened with the OKC series too.  It was all about what should be done for Russell Westbrook now instead of shifting the conversation to how successful the Trail Blazers were.  I think big market or small the media just has their favorites.
John Wall is the alcoholic version of Russell Westbrook

D’Angelo Russell Westbrook
"You realize that that Lakers team had better shooting than KD had in OKC? He was out there with Roberson, Dion Waiters and Russell Westbrook, and yet people still make it seem like he was supposed to the favorite to the win NBA title that season."
The issue with this is that he isn’t a primary/second scoring option anymore which honestly is better for his game. At the âme time a lot of the US media hasn’t been watching the raptors and thus keep judging Lowry’s stat lines as if he should be a similar scorer as Damian pillars or Russell Westbrook. As a raptors fan even though he’s getting paid 30 mil I’m glad that the organization and coaching staffs have put him in a position to succeed. A lot of teams would feel obligated to continue force feeding their highest paid players.
"being more efficient than your oppenent wins games, if you leave russell westbrook wide open he's liable to miss easy shots, you dont even need to defend him, do the same thing to kyle korver and your team's going to have a rough night  you obviously need to have a wide variety of skills on both sides of the ball  the only reason I didnt know why kyle korver doesnt start is because I havent watched basketball in a while.  we could both take an IQ test to see who's smarter, I'll take a random guess, and guess that it's me  the warriors lost because steph curry was inefficient, that illustrates how important field goal percentage is in the nba, having someone shoot like russell westbrook is a liability, and having someone shoot like kyle korver is a giant boon, shooting and making shots is the most important skill in basketball, period, if you dont make shots you have to make up for it in other ways, still, scoring points for your team is the most important skill"
"of course you have to bring more than shooting, but at the end of the day if no one on your team can score you wont win, when paul george didnt put in heroic efforts, the thunder couldnt win, because russell westbrook couldnt score with high enough efficiency to keep up with opposing teams, it's about efficiency, if your shooting percentage, combined with defense is more efficient than the opponent you win, and if your team can't make shots then it's hard to win.  so in the end if korvers defense is really so horrendous to negate .450 3 point shooting, then fine, I haven't watched him play enough, but it would have to be so utterly awful that he just gives up the lane for layups every play  I acknowledge you need both parts of the game, and this thread is a perfect example of why you need both parts."
Russell “All-Defense Team” Westbrook
"I meant purely from the standpoint of the talent level around the respective player. The Thunder had a Prime Russell Westbrook, not to mention Ibaka, Adams, and Kanter. Besides, the Spurs were the #1 defense in large part *because* of Kawhi... Duncan, Parker, and Ginobilli were well beyond their primes by that point.   Bottom line: the 2016 Thunder beating the 2016 Spurs does not even constitute evidence that KD is better than Kawhi Leonard **right now**."
This has been the narrative almost the entire season. It never made sense to me given how limited his offensive skills are. He plays great on defense but to me he's a tall version of Russell Westbrook. Whenever I heard someone say he is the best player in the league I thought that was pretty disrespectful to guys like Durant and Lebron.
Unless your name is Russell Westbrook.
Kobe wasn't inefficient. Russell Westbrook is an example of a player that is inefficient.

"Harden is only sometimes ""unstoppable"" because of how often he is rewarded for foul hunting. We see what happens to him every year when he doesnt get the bullshit calls...he starts looking much more like Russell Westbrook and is quite stoppable.   Giannis is unstoppable because he is actually unstoppable even when he doesnt get calls,sunless you knock him to the floor. His impact is like young Shaq but even more dangerous. He gets to the basket with only one step in half court and either dunks or lays it up over the defender with his incredible wingspan."
"Giannis on who's more dismissive, him or OKC's Russell Westbrook. ""Δεν συγκρίνω τον εαυτό μου με κανέναν."" Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of Gregg Popovich. ""Θα σας επιτρέψω να ερμηνεύσετε αυτό που θέλετε,"" Giannis said."
"I don’t agree with that. Okc has done what since kd left? And an ept franchise does not trade away James harden like they did and Russell Westbrook was never held accountable there. Kd leaving okc was not the problem, it was where he went. His former teammate Westbrook will never win a ring so he was right."

Klay has an argument as arguably the best two way  Shooting guard. Although only really starting to be considered around 2014.  On the that note you have CP3 as probably the best Two way Point Guard.  Then you have Kyrie, and Jimmy G Buckets (although he only really started to blossom around the middle of the decade.)  And then there will be some that might consider Kobe (Championships), and DRose (MVP). Although I think they are out due to Missed time.  There is a possible argument, but Dame is more in the 6-7 range personally."
If I had to bet on anyone being faithful it would be Russell Westbrook.
"this is absolutely ridiculous. Donovan is an esteemed NCAA coach, only of the only coaches to ever 2peat in the national championship, and he played a huge role in getting the Thunder past that monster 67 win Spurs team in 2016. he's been a better than average coach through this tenure in OKC and it's clear to anybody who's seen them play that Russell Westbrook is the x factor between all of the coaches that have cycled through"

Will Russell Westbrook be the all time leader in turnovers?
"1-10 seems pretty good.. 11-25 is a bit off.. I would put Beal and Towns closer to top 15 over CP3 and Gobert.. also Irving and Embiid over Butler easily..   If I were to rank the top 35 players I would go...  1 Kevin Durant  2 LeBron James  3 Giannis Antetokounmpo  4 Kawhi Leonard  5 Stephen Curry  6 James Harden  7 Anthony Davis  8 Damian Lillard  9 Nikola Jokic  10 Joel Embiid  11 Paul George  12 Kyrie Irving  13 Karl-Anthony Towns  14 Jimmy Butler  15 Blake Griffin  16 Klay Thompson  17 Bradley Beal  18 Rudy Gobert  19 Russell Westbrook   20 Kemba Walker  21 Devin Booker  22 Victor Oladipo  23 LaMarcus Aldridge  24 Donovan Mitchell  25 Ben Simmons  26 Al Horford  27 DeMar DeRozan  28 Luka Doncic  29 Jrue Holiday  30 Mike Conley  31 D'Angelo Russell  32 Pascal Siakam  33 CJ McCollum  34 Tobias Harris  35 Chris Paul  &amp;#x200B;  Mentions..

He asked why the thunder collapsed when Russell Westbrook wasn’t on the court. I think the thunder had like a 7 point lead when Westbrook checked out and then the Rockets immediately took the lead
Imagine if this happened to Russell Westbrook
I wouldn’t say stay in OKC. Regardless of how close he and Russell Westbrook were it had to be frustrating with how much Russ demands the ball to be in his hands. Kd is probably the best in the world at creating his own shot and with Russ at PG he was limited on what he could do. He thrives at GSW because they all bring it up the floor and do their own thing and are very unselfish about it.
Shots fired at Russell Westbrook
"Slight Disclaimer: My list FAVOURS playoff performances (although that's not ALL that matters, it's worth more to my PERSONAL rankings than regular season)  1) LeBron James  2) Kawhi Leonard  3) Kevin Durant  4) James Harden  5) Steph Curry  6) Giannis Antetokounmpo  7) Joel Embiid  8) Anthony Davis  9) Damian Lillard  10) Nikola Jokic  Honorable Mentions: Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker"
"no, no ring of Kevin Durant's will ever be valid - UNLESS he wins on a team with Russell Westbrook BUT Westbrook ~MUST~ lead the team in FGA"
"Wait, what?   In 2013, KD actually led the league in scoring, Melo just played less games. KD scored more points.   In 2016, Russ really took a step forward, plus we had Serge taking more shots, and Dion Waiters taking more shots.   KD won't win another scoring title ever if he stays in Golden State. But I assume this post is just to take a shot at Russ (with the ""higher b-ball iq"" quip).   It should be noted, that Kevin Durant won *all* of his scoring titles with Russ. It also goes to note, that Russell Westbrook to Kevin Durant was the most assisted bucket in the nba *for years*.   so basically: fuck off with this shit."
"LeBron James, Joel Embiid, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, John Wall and Damian Lillard in that order."
See Russell Westbrook
"He had his best year overall finishing at the rim in the regular season. I suspect that his struggles in the Portland series stem from Kanter playing ridiculously far back near the rim, preventing Westbrook from blowing by him. Russell also had a few hear scratching blown layups in the series though."
"James Harden 2019 playoffs: eFG% - 46%, TS% - 54%  Russell Westbrook 2019 playoffs: eFG% - 41%, TS% - 47%"
The Russell Westbrook approach
Russell Westbrook is far more popular/famous. He's also black.  Joke about Enes Kanter and Internal Turkish Relations won't generate as much buzz.
Ya'll deserve this for ganging up on that poor homeless man Russell Westbrook
1. Bill Laimbeer  2. Bruce Bowen  3. Javariss Crittenton  4. Russell Westbrook  5. Jokic?  He's MAYBE in the top 5 most lovable players in NBA history
Things more successful than Russell Westbrook.
How do you not feel a 200lb man land on your foot?  Notice how he went at the spurs even back in his maverick days elbowing patty and holding kawhi in an arm bar basically while dragging him around.  Did u even watch the video I tagged u in?  Same year he knocks Russell Westbrook down with hands to the face. He had a dirty ass season and career.   That play on kawhi was deliberate. You don’t have someone that big land on you and not notice.
"Off the top of my head, the top 4 are concrete and the 5th spot has some room. Off the bat, I would have John Wall 5th with Kyrie/Lowry being his main competition.  Steph, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard,  John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley  If you consider James Harden a point guard that's a seperate conversation, and Wall doesn't crack the top 5. John Wall can be considered top 5 for sure, he has been an absolute force. But this decade has been the best for point guards in NBA history and there is tough competition when looking an overall body of work.  Looking up the stats; he has the:  * 3rd most assists this decade * 4th most steals  And those are the 2 significant categories where he places top 5.  **WS**:  1. Chris Paul 2. Steph Curry 3. Westbrook 4. Lowry 5. Lillard 6. Conley 7. Kyrie 8. George Hill 9. Kemba 10. Dragic  John Wall is 15th amongst guards in this category. I understand that this is a cumulative stat and he has missed some time, (24th in games played, 8th in games started amongst all guards over the past decade), but when looking at **WS/48**:  1. Paul 1. Curry 1. Westbrook 1. Lowry 1. Lillard 1. Irving 1. Conley 1. IT 1. George Hill 1. Chauncey  John Wall ranks 35th in this category. That's pretty bad. Honestly, filtering different advanced stats doesn't help his case too much. I think this is mainly a case of stats being flawed and not telling the whole story, Wall is a defensive menace and a winning basketball player. Hope he starts right back where he stopped."
"""What's a pass?"" - Russell Westbrook"
"That's partly the Wizards fault, athletic bad shooting point guards dont win championships, see Derek Rose &amp; Russell Westbrook.   &amp;#x200B;  And at $35mil+ a year there's no excuse for not being contenders every year. If you demanded that much cash you better be able to carry a team since you won't be able to pay for help."
Russell westbrook joins the warriors. That’s it
KD leaving Russell Westbrook will be one of the greatest career decisions in NBA history
"Based on his post history, he’s obsessed with Russell Westbrook"

Boston’s getting that Russell Westbrook treatment from the rim.
imagine if Russell Westbrook handled things with such class...
"Russell Westbrook literally got me into the NBA in his MVP season. I started watching around November before all the triple double hype started, and watching his insane amount of energy every night was awesome. That Denver game winner will be forever burned in my mind.  He's rough around the edges sometimes, but almost no one is more fun to watch on a nightly basis."
Russell Westbrook is good at basketball
"Fortunately for this fan , he made a direct racist comment and was given the chance to apologize.   Thank God he didn’t make a less direct racist comment to Russell Westbrook while intoxicated or else he would have been banned for life! Phew!"

Skip Pass: LeBron James. Second honors to Russell Westbrook  Best change in pace and setting defenders off rhythm: Kyrie Irving  Creating space for a jumper: Curry and Harden
"A lot of people think he’s not that athletic. If you watch him for a bit you’ll know he is. But he doesn’t use it all the time in a way a younger Russell Westbrook or John Wall did, so people equate that to not being athletic. I’ve gotten into debates with people on here, and even in our team subreddit, about whether Lonzo is athletic or not."
Not everyone can be clutch like Russell Westbrook.
That version is still faster than PGs not named Russell Westbrook or De'Aaron Fox
"jokic not even top 5. lbj first then cp3 then harden and westbrook then its a tossup. ive seen some pretty dimes from a lot of elite players like trae young, dangelo russell, simmons, lowry. id put wall as ky 5th but hes not playing so"
Russell Westbrook is 30 years old. The player he is is the player he is. There is no coach that is magically going to come in and save the day
"Giannis just showed in this series that at this point in his development, he's basically a 7' Russell Westbrook. Their skill sets and weaknesses are about as similar as a 7' PF and a 6'-3"" PG could possibly be.   He may have better decision making than Westbrook already, but until he improves his outside shot (and I think he will), he won't be able to carry his team to the next level."
And you people wonder why Russell Westbrook has issues with the media
Defending Russell Westbrook is not even close to the same skillset as defending Steph Curry.  Valentino Rossi is the greatest motorcycle racer in the world. That doesn't mean he can drive Formula 1. Michael Schumacher also can't win a superbike championship.
"""Giannis is basically a taller Russell Westbrook"""
"Imagine if Russell Westbrook did this, everyone would absolutely shit on him"
"&gt; ""The Warriors have a tradition of pairing rookies with a veteran. Jeremy Tyler, also a first-round hopeful who fell to the second round the year before, wound up as Green s vet.  &gt; With his lifestyle, you would ve never guessed Tyler was on a cheap salary and barely clinging to a roster spot. He introduced Green and the other youngsters to the lavishness of being an NBA player.  &gt; Then came summer league. Not even a month removed from the draft, Green and Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezeli highlighted some all-out practices in Las Vegas. In the midst of a heated session, Tyler called what Green thought was a weak foul.  &gt; Green went off.  &gt; He told Tyler it wasn t a foul. He told Tyler he was soft. He told Tyler he d never get respect in this league. And then he denounced him.  &gt; He dropped him as his vet, Barnes said, still smiling at the years-old incident. He said Jeremy couldn t be his vet anymore. ""   Ah yes, the seasoned 1 year vet who never got playing time, who didn't work hard, who set a bad example for all the rookies on the team. Draymond stood up to him and made it clear he wasn't about that. That same article you linked talked about how Draymond respected Mo Speights:  ""Monday against Oklahoma City, Green jumped on Speights for poor help defense. Then he spent the entire time during Russell Westbrook s free throws motivating Speights. Even though Speights had subbed out and was on the bench, Green was still jawing, trying to get Speights to get his head in the game. ""  Like I said, *that's* who Draymond is."
They need to make a Sequel with Russell Westbrook and Paul George.
"I will never give russell westbrook credit for his rebounds or volume of points. Does it matter if he's producing more points if he's shooting inefficiently from everywhere on the court to do it? He can't even make FTs. Does it matter if he's producing more rebounds if his bigs are boxing out other dudes to let him rebound the ball? The stats are misleading in those cases. Does it matter if he's producing more assists if OKC ranks 23rd in the league in assisted baskets and GSW ranks #1? But how does that logic work, nobody on the warriors have as many assists as WB, they're all inferior ball distributors...huh  WB is the best fit for the situation he is in now, as a ball dominant guard with the license to chuck at will. He would NOT win more games with curry and KD as teammates, he's a terrible shooter from everywhere, and he's not a better distributor than draymond or steph, so why have him bring the ball up?"
John Wall is a middle class man’s Russell Westbrook.
Are Kemba Walker and Russell Westbrook THAT much worse than Klay?
Saying Westbrook and great defender in the same sentence is absolute horse-shit. The amount of times he gets lost on defense and cant stay on his man is insurmountable. Ive watched him every year and he hasn’t changed much since 2012 on his defense. Theres a reason he had to switch off of Dame the whole series and Dame guarded him. Russell might be one of the worst guards in terms of off-ball defense.
"oh dear, westbrook over anybody is hard to swallow after watching him get exposed in that blazer series. The blazers were daring him to shoot and he still kept bricking. You could literally pinpoint when the thunder started losing games because that happened to be the exact moment russell started shooting again"
"- GSW wins on KD's game 7 buzzer beater that bounces around the rim 12 times before falling in so I never have to see Kawhi's shot again   - Jimmy Butler uses his $19.8M player option to opt in for 2019-20 and then signs a 5/75 deal and tells everyone he's committed to winning in Philly and doesn't care about a max contract   - Kawhi also signs a 5/75 deal with the Sixers because he misses working with Brett Brown and also just wants to win   - Joel Embiid gets cut and shows up to training camp healthier than he's ever been at 280lbs of pure muscle with a Russell Westbrook portrait tattoo on his arm   - Ben Simmons spends all summer in the gym reconstructing his shot and immediately shoots 75% from everywhere for the rest of his 35-year NBA career   - Elton Brand uses the MLE to sign KD   - JJ Redick re-signs for 2/10 and the Sixers provide him with a private helicopter chauffeur to take him to and from his home in Brooklyn   - Jared Dudley accepts an unpaid internship in the Sixers mailroom   - Pat Riley accepts an offer to be an assistant coach under Brett Brown   - Steph Curry demands a trade to the Sixers    If you think about it, it's really a win-win for anybody who likes basketball"
"Just copying an pasting my reply from before to add on because I love talking about jumpshot mechanics. OP knows what the fuck he's talking about fam.  &amp;#x200B;   It’s so funny because I notice that Kawhi’s jumpshot at college is like in the middle of between Lonzo and KD’s range of “slingshots,” where as we know who is good with it and who isn’t. I’ve personally have only done my jump shooting learning based on Pro Shot and lots of research of my own and am a teacher, so I’m always critical of my kids’ jumpshots outside and trying to help them clean it up for when they get older haha. But as you said with the explosion of his knees, he suffered with his “jump” in his jump like Russell Westbrook does now, too much jump and waiting on his way down to release. Curry is so damn amazing because it’s such a small jump, but incredible spring due to his one way release and letting go right as he hits the apex of his jump.   &amp;#x200B;  You rarely see a player jump on a jumpshot and land in the same place they started their jumpshot. From what I learned from Pro Shot is the “sweep and sway.” When the shooting shoulder, hip and shooting feet at an angle not pointed at the basket. are faced the basket rather than them being squared to the basket with 10 toes facing the basket. You don’t see guys shooting with head leaning in closer to the basket than their feet, it’s always the feet and it works the way up to the head being furthest. When doing this, the shoulders aren’t stiff and it allows for more range, a better arc on shot release, etc.   I noticed that current Kawhi’s jumper is still a bit stiff in the sense that it looks like he’s still only jumping straight up and not much, but hey he’s doing a hell of a job with his game at this point of career, and man those curls off to the midrange J are so automatic, he looks like Kobe out there. I actually dont know much about Chip and will definitely do more studying on him, thank you."
"For comparison, 1st team All-NBA players that the Warriors faced in the Western Playoffs during their 5 year run:  * 2015 - Anthony Davis, James Harden * 2016 - Russell Westbrook * 2017 - Kawhi Leonard (for 1 half) * 2018 - Anthony Davis, James Harden * 2019 - James Harden"
"Problem with that is, D’Antoni didn’t make Nash or Harden better shooters. He just encouraged the team to space the floor more.   Dantoni system wouldn’t work in Houston because having Russell shoot a ton of 3s is a recipe to lose games. Aside from being in the paint, Russell best shot is the mid-range pull-up, a shot dantoni disposes unless you’re can hit it consistently (and let’s be honest, Westbrook isn’t exactly a dead-eye shooter form there either).   D’Antoni would literally be one of the worst coaching options for Westbrook and the thunder."
"Dude holy crap, this is one of the best things I’ve ever read on this sub. Who have you studied from and where because you clearly know what you’re talking about. It’s so funny because I notice that Kawhi’s jumpshot at college is like in the middle of between Lonzo and KD’s range of “slingshots,” where as we know who is good with it and who isn’t.

Curry is so damn amazing because it’s such a small jump, but incredible spring due to his one way release and letting go right as he hits the apex of his jump. The whole point with his butt sticking out as well, the body should be leaning in a sense where the feet should come furthest out first to the head and shoulders being the part that’s back more, body should be at an obtuse angle  with the line of the court being the back, head being end of line being back. This is so that the shoulders can relax more and there’s more arc on the release of the ball. I noticed that current Kawhi’s jumper is still a bit stiff in the sense that it looks like he’s still only jumping straight up and not much, but hey he’s doing a hell of a job with his game at this point of career, and man those curls off to the midrange J are so automatic,  he looks like Kobe out there.

"&gt;LeBron, (Russell) Westbrook, they’re devastating on the ball, but you don’t worry about them too much off the ball.  Did Miami LeBron never existed? In 2013 LeBron led the league in 3p catch &amp; shoot % and he was also top 5 in alley oop finishes."
"&gt; Because the superstars on the opposition wouldn’t be so obsessed with padding their individual stats as they would with winning as a team.   KD was 2nd team all-nba this year.  Paul George, the man who replaced KD as OKC's small forward, was first team all-nba this year.    Russell Westbrook and Paul George won a whopping 1 playoff game this season.  They got dumped out of the playoffs in 5 games by the blazers, the same blazers team the warriors just swept.    Russell Westbrook is a stat-padding ball-hog.  He will never be Steph Curry, and doesn't belong in the same conversation with Steph."

I mean if you're gonna make a thread saying Donovan Mitchell was drafted by the Nuggets. I don't see how it's any different from saying Russell Westbrook was drafted by the Sonics.
"Wait, the Thunder drafted Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, *and* James Harden?"
I was honestly expecting an upvoted self post regarding Russell Westbrook
"They're not lazy, they just immediately jump on other stats to cover up for Lebron's failures.   If that due were Russell Westbrook he would be getting roasted daily."
"Respond when were facing adversity? Man i couldnt wait til we faced the celtics in the playoffs just to shut you up. You can clearly see now that Kawhi is better than a less athletic russell westbrook you ran out as your ""top 10 player"""
"Except one could argue, as this article does, that his rebounding helps make our offense better.  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  Expending energy to try and improve your team's performance seems like a thing that a guy would do if he cares most about winning."
Russell Westbrook averages a triple double for three years  and hasn’t been out the first round in three years . That’ll show you how much triple doubles are valued in terms of winning.
Russell Westbrook.... we would have enough bricks to solve the homeless crisis in America
"I know y'all can't escape the anti-westbrook circlejerk to think for even a second, but there is absolutely no argument that klay deserved it over russell"
"He can pass and has a solid IQ that doesn't make him very versatile. (Sorry to say it pls don't hate) KD is versatile. Kawhi, Klay Thompson, LeBron, Russell Westbrook etc. All these guys do more than score in the paint/shoot 3s"
"Damn FUCK the media idiots and their shit narratives. Both Klay and Draymond deserve All-NBA spots. We’ll look back on lists like this and want to puke not seeing some of the best players to EVER do it on an historically great(if not the best) team all-time, not making these lists behind players like Kemba Walker, Kyrie Irving, Rudy Gobert, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, etc. How fucking stupid and lacking perspective can somebody be to mangle their vote so badly???"
"Except his shooting is literally costing his team wins. Since KD left, Russ’ playoff games have consisted of   2017  Game 1: 22 points on 23 shots.   Game 2: 51 points on 43 shots.   Game 4: 35 Points on 28 shots.   2018:  Game 1: 29 points on 25 shots  Game 2: 19 Points in 19 Shots   Game 3: 14 points on 17 shots   Game 5: 45 points on 39 shots   Game 6: 46 points on 43 shots   2019:   Game 2: 14 points on 20 Shots   Game 4: 14 points on 21 shots   Game 5: 29 points on 31 shots.   Russell is the only superstar in the league where these performances have become normal for him. High shots attempts with below average efficiency.   Don’t think the plain numbers do him justice? Over these last three years, Russell boasts an astonishing 49% TS in the playoffs along with 0 offensive win shares (a total of 0.8, 0.06 per 48) and a VORP of 1.3.   For comparison, Harden: 56% TS, 3 offensive win shares (5.1 total, 0.17 per 48) and a VORP of 3.7  Curry: 62% TS, 5.5 offensive win shares (7.9 total,  0.22 per 48) and a VORP of 4.3.   Kyrie: 55% TS, 1.5 offensive win shares (2.4 total, 0.11 per 48) and a VORP of 0.9.   All of which have gotten further in the playoffs than Westbrook. Fact of the matter is, triple double or not, Westbrook’s play style is not conductive with winning basketball and his refusal to acknowledge that makes him a worse player than he would be otherwise."
"This is formatted so poorly, it hurts my eyes. Imma fix it (positions are just for fun)  First team:  PG: Stephen Curry SG: James Harden  SF: Paul George PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo C: Nikola Jokic  Second team: PG: Damian Lillard SG: Kyrie Irving  SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Kevin Durant C: Joel Embiid  Third team:  PG: Russell Westbrook SG: Kemba Walker SF: Lebron James PF: Blake Griffin C: Rudy Gobert"
Well because when people used to get it before they usually ended up winning. There's a reason a Draymond Green triple double is considered much more valuable than Russell Westbrook triple double.
Nothing you said has changed my mind in the slightest.   It's impressive that Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double for 3 straight seasons.  If you're not impressed by that feat then I couldn't care less so idk why you're trying to convince me otherwise.
And Russell Westbrook is lucky to make 3rd Team.
"I hear you, man. Hey you know who inefficient af tho? Russell Westbrook"
"It not a caveat its literally how I wrote my first post. Your reading comprehension isn't my responsibility.   Uhh, yes lol. Westbrook is literally the ultimate example of a player that can only function as a first option type player. He's proven hes not, or at least is no longer, top 5 in that role, so he's basically worthless at this point. If current Kemba Walker or Russell Westbrook are on your team, you're not a contender, end of story."
"Russell Westbrook: Averages triple double, leads league in assists:  Third team?  LeBron James, Averages 27/8/8: Third team?  I don't post those to suggest I disagree with the selections. Only to highlight how lucky we are to be watching a league that is SO deep that performances like those aren't even voted to the second All-NBA team."
"Steph Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook and John Wall got a Supermax so far, Gobert is a defensive monster but he’s not in the same tier as those guys except maaaaaybe wall and that destroyed Washington financially."
It's interesting to me that 1st Team All-NBA player Paul George only managed to win 49 games and get eliminated in the 1st round despite having Russell Westbrook as a sidekick.  Kyrie Irving carried a team of non-stars to 49 wins and the 2nd round and his own fans act like he's the worst player ever.
"Most of these defensive stats include getting rebounds and assist...these stats are useless as a precise way to measure a players defensive capabilities. Russell Westbrook posted the 5th best DBPM and the 4th most defensive winshares in the league this year. In the 2016-2017 NBA season Westbrook posted the 2nd best DBPM that second at 4.7, only behind Draymond's 5.0. According to these stats Westbrook is DPOY worthy."

Russell Westbrook
You thought Russell Westbrook and James Harden were the top 2 players in the league in 2017?
Probably Kuzma. I didn’t make the assertion not to trade for Westbrook because I wanted to discredit or slight him. I made that comment because I don’t think his style of play would transition well into the team due to LeBron already being ball dominant. Russell is ball dominant as well so I believe that would be redundant and more importantly fruitless.
Imagine unironically believing that people will not remember Russell Westbrook averaging a 30 point triple double for the first time in over five decades.
Apparently Russell Westbrook is at the dinner as well
basically take 4 from rebounds add 4 to assists and that is basically a Russell Westbrook stat-line
"What the FUCK?  Curry/Klay/Gallinari/Bertans/Towns is kinda close to fucking LeBron James, Nikola Jokic, and Russell Westbrook paired with Doncic and Holiday?"
Russell Westbrook = Berserk wool sluts
"Why is it ok for Drake to touch a coach? It isn't, and you know it. This entire sub went nuts when a kid in Denver touched Russell Westbrook."
"Man he can cheer all he wants but he gets all in opposing players' faces and they can't do anything because he's Drake. He gets damn near on the court. I need to see Russell Westbrook beat his ass or as least curse him out.  That's the worst of it but it's also annoying to see him in mad recaps of things. I fuck with Drake, but he doesn't need to be there for everything. Every time I see him in a basketball picture [it makes me laugh because like why is dude there](https://static.vibe.com/files/photo_gallery_images/VIBE-Drake-Awkward-Sports-moments-DeMarcus-Cousins-Interview-400x267.jpg)? I'm thankful he wasn't there for the Kawhi game-winner against Philly because he would've made the historical video less cool."
Glossing over the physical difference between Fox and Wall would be like glossing over the physical difference between Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. Wall's use of his body and how he could overpower dudes in transition was a big part of his game.   You can disagree with the Fox/Rondo comparison if you want but if you're trying to sell Fox/Wall as a better comp I sure aint buying. Either just say player comps are useless and a waste of the time but dont be out here pretending like Wall/Fox is suddenly some magically superior thing.
"""Dejounte Murray, Spurs: In his second season, Murray ranked second among point guards in defensive rebounding percentage (22.0), behind the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Russell Westbrook (25.4)."" Whats that supposed to mean?"
"The flaw here is that unless if the team is contending and missing the final part of the team, it would make almost no sense to trade these guys.  And I sort of doubt the teams mid 30s John Wall or Russell Westbrook or late 30s Chris Paul making 40+ million a year are going to be “a piece away”.  The amount of bad salary they would have to take back when they could just let that salary come off the books at year end won’t make it very valuable unless a team was willing to give up a bunch of picks for other terrible, more long term, salaries"
"Hold on, is this what happened to Russell Westbrook and that dude he never answers questions for?"
"Was that the team that had Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka?"
"Basketball iq is vague as shit.    Magic (like lebron, Ben Simmons, cp3) had a knack for seeing things before they happened and having a quick reaction time so that he could make a pass to someone who didn’t even know he was open himself, because somehow he knew the defense was moving in the other direction and that the recipient would be open at the exact moment the pass would be delivered.    I wouldn’t really call that b-ball iq.  It’s just a very innate skill.   For example, Ben Simmons currently is so stupid (or afraid) that he can’t even realize that just attempting shots would put him on another level as a player.   Russell Westbrook also has good passing vision and yet plays like an idiot."
"What would happen if we tried to develop him into a pg? He is an okay playmaker right now but if he some how, with a lot of help from coaching staff and luck, calmed down a little more and developed his game to be a Russell Westbrook lite would it be effective? Or am I as high as I think I am right now?"
Russell Westbrook
No doubt. I think Russell Westbrook is an asshole to the media but I can understand why the media can rub some players the wrong way.
"it has nothing to do with Steph ,it's about Isiah ,and you're the revisionist here ,Isiah is widely considered one of the 7 best players of the 80s which says a lot since it was the most star studded era ,he trails MJ,Moses,Kareem,Larry Bird and Magic but was more impactful during that decade than some legends like Dr J ,Dominique ,James Worthy and so on .. he had 4 consecutive seasons of averaging 20 and 10 which no player has ever done until Russell Westbrook recently,he's also the only player other than John Stockton to average 13.5 assists per game or more ,he was a dominant scorer and playmaker in an era where no one gave that responsibility to a point guard ,during the 80s it was widely considered that if your point guard is your leader in shot attempts that you're a lottery team which is something you fail to mention ,as for Dumars being better than Isiah during their contending years it is simply not true ,when the Pistons reached the conference finals in 1987 Isiah was averaging 24/9 while Dumars was still a sophomore avraging 13ppg and a 3rd option on the team ,the next year when they reached the finals Isiah was averaging 22/9 and Dumars was still at 13ppg ,he only became an important part of the offense after the Dantley/Aguire trade ,isiah was the unquestioned leader and best player on that team ,what he achieved during a rather short career further illustrates to his great ability as a basketball player ,you'd have to watch him to fully understand his abilities and not come up with something such as ""Joe Dumars was better"" ,hell even MJ who hated Isiah's guts admitted in the 90s that he was the hardest player he's ever had to guard ."
Replace Klay Thompson instead of Russell Westbrook on that starting lineup and it makes it a lot easier
"36 more games, when a guy has played further into the playoffs, is better? you think that's worth mentioning over seven seasons? that's 5 games a season....that's an ankle sprain. russell westbrook is not kyrie irving in this convo here. hell nah."
I've read Russell Westbrook should model his play style after Draymond
"Most guys don't have a 7'2"" center who blocks out for you. Well, except Russell Westbrook."

"Except for when your name is Russell Westbrook and its the playoffs, apparently."
"Jeff Teague.  From left to right, it's Damian Lillard, John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba Walker, and Jeff Teague.  Why Teague is in this lineup (as of 2016!) and Curry isn't is anyone's guess."

Last I heard it was Russell Westbrook in a Wholefoods in Portland
"I got lit up by Warriors fans on social media when I said Steph Curry played like shit in the 8 games before game 6 against the Rockets, literally fans talking about how at his worst he was ""russell Westbrook"" like the greatest shooter of all time shooting like one of the worst bulk shooters in NBA history is even slightly a good comparison and then they all went in tirades about how nobody believed in them in the WCF even though Vegas had them as massive favorites over the Blazers. So I'm not surprised when the players grasp at it if many of the fans do as well."
We'll need Russell Westbrook to save us money then

&gt; Westbrook is ten times the player Russell is.  I got so confused reading this until I got it
Westbrook is ten times the player Russell is. I know Russ had a down year and maybe his prime is over now and it's just down hill from there but he's been an amazing player the past decade and I'm not even a fan of his.
Russell Westbrook is rated.
RW= Russell Westbrook?
&gt;coach who will shut down Russell when he’s being an idiot  1. That person does not exist. There are maybe 1 or 2 coaches in the league that *might* have the ability to change Westbrook’s game this late in his career. That’s a big maybe though.   2. When Westbrook decided to stay in OKC after KDs departure it was at that moment that Presti gave the keys to the franchise to Russ. He single handedly kept a small market team relevant by deciding to sign an extension.   3. Donovan is by no means a great coach but he gets WAY too much flak for this team’s personnel issues. And Russell will never change. It doesn’t matter who’s coaching him at this point.
none of them needed to handle anyone like russell westbrook
"lol. Kd was also 8th in jerseys sales this year. Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Joel Embid, Giannis Antentokoumpo, Kyrie Irving, Steph Curry, and Lebron James all sold more jerseys than Kd."
Using TS to indicate he had a good shooting night is disingenuous. He didn't even shoot 50% from the field and his TS was skewed cause be was gifted 14 freethrows.   If you score 47 and your team can't cut it to less than 7 *all game* that's Russell Westbrook level empty stats right there
1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Kawhi Leonard  4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo  7. Anthony Davis  8. Russell Westbrook  9. Joel Embiid  10. Damian Lillard
Russell Westbrook will never win a title with the Thunder ;)
"Jesus, that's pathetic.  Westbrook won his MVP because the media loved him. He's made All NBA teams over better players because the media loved him. He's the second highest paid player in the NBA and basically destroyed the small market superstar stereotype because the media loved him.  Then he was a ridiculous asshole to the media for years and so they turned on him so hard that despite having one of his worst ever seasons and being the fourth best PG at best he still received 1st team All NBA votes.  The media is correctly pointing out some of Westbrook's glaring flaws and suddenly he's a tragic victim of media hate. He is the player who has benefitted the most from media bias, possibly the most of all time. A Russell Westbrook fan complaining about the media should be willing to give back the MVP in trade, otherwise they're hypocritical douchebags."
"He might not have an MVP and I would find it very difficult to put him that high, people forget all time greats, because we haven't seen them play. Bench players are significantly better talent wise than there starters from 40 years ago, but the game has evolved (Omar got got) and greatness is relative to your peers as it's hard to compare eras . The past 10 years of MVPs contain 5 years of Lebron, one for KD, and some awesome guards (Curry, Harden, and Westbrook). If you want to go out on MVP as the barometer for greatness (top 10, From Wikipedia, there are ties; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, Lebron James, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Magic, Bob Petit, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Steve Nash\[who should have 3 IMHO\], Curry. Lebron and Curry are the two who need currently fit the statistical merits to be considered GOAT and Top 10 currently playing. Time might change that. Kawhi is a top 3 player in the league today (arguably the best when THE TORONTO FUCKING RAPTORS are in the finals and he is a major part of that, pinch me please). If you are good enough to be one of the best in the league you have a good chance to go down in history as one of the best. Players have more knowledge on how to stay healthy, diet, train, and strategy not to mention the support staffs within the organization and arena (cleaners to the presidents). In the end only time will tell, but it's subjective so it just means debates with buddies, friends and guys. People under 25 like myself have never even sniffed a championship in Toronto. This city is ready to go off and celly a long awaited championship. I cannot believe that there is a team in my city on the verge of winning, specifically the Raptors (my money was always on the leafs for their money or bluejays cause baseball is baseball). LETS GO RAPTORS!!!"
"He’s great for all the obvious reasons: growing revenue,        increased viewership, and accord and trust between team owners and players (which is unique among major sports).   He has also been able to make the NBA a platform in addition to a sport. NBA stars are bigger than ever because of many of his wise decisions. The league is covered from all angles 12 months a year because he and others figured out how to sell basketball players and culture to people who don’t like or watch or care about basketball. There are people who write about what Westbrook is [wearing](https://www.gq.com/gallery/russell-westbrook-style-look-book) instead of how he is playing. No other sport has figured this out yet.   Even the NFL, despite having much more revenue, has almost no global stars. This is why EA resorted to hiring James Harden and Chris Paul to do [Madden](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chron.com/sports/rockets/amp/Rockets-James-Harden-Chris-Paul-Madden-commercial-12181107.php) football commercials and didn’t use actual NFL players like Cam Newton or Todd Gurley. To highlight this [disparity](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/02/17/the-2018-nba-all-stars-players-who-earn-the-most-from-endorsements/amp/) consider the following, and ask yourself how many people could even recognize Mike Trout or Patrick Mahomes on the street:  &gt; The NBA’s 10 biggest endorsement stars will generate a combined $234 million off the court this year by Forbes’ count. There is a staggering gap between the NBA and the other three major U.S. sports leagues. Football’s 10 biggest endorsers will generate an estimated $90 million, while baseball ($25 million) and hockey ($20 million) aren’t in the same galaxy. European soccer stars are the only reasonable comparison, but the top 10 in soccer will still “only” earn around $135 million.  Why is this important? Because when you can be a B-level star and make $10mm/year endorsing products outside of basketball, you can sign on to having a max salary (which redounds to the lesser players’ benefit)  despite your actual value being higher. You can sign shorter contracts in order that allow for more player movement, more parity, and greater league interest since you know your income is diversified. You can play in smaller markets like OKC and Cleveland without taking a huge economic hit since you know the brand is global, and the money is there if you can sell yourself to the public by using the NBA as a vehicle to do so.   Silver is great because he is able to sell everyone on the idea that more money coming in from multiple streams is best for everyone from ownership on down. He respects the players, the product, and the owners in that general order. He’s not adversarial (like Stern was) and incompetent like Goodell, and he’s not complacent like Manfred.   Silver is great because he gets it, understands trends, and is desirous to go where the market and trends lead him without stubborn resistance.   He revamped the all star game by making a show out of the player picking process. He backs players who want to exercise their free-speech rights. He championed legalized sports gambling in a league where there were recent cases of refs betting on games. He created the replay center in NY to protect the integrity of the game. He revised the lottery odds to discourage tanking. He manages to get varied ownership groups, who bought at wildly different valuations and likely have wildly different goals and aims, to publicly get behind his leadership. And probably most impressively, he managed to get a billionaire to sell his franchise without having to make it a lengthy, expensive legal process. That’s next level Jedi shit.   He’s a realist who recognizes the game is stronger when he can sell the public on these great athletes as people. He empowers people.   And as for why he needs people to actually play when healthy, it’s (again) because he needs to have a consistent product to sell."
Kyle's been better than Russell Westbrook in the playoffs for the past three years.
&gt;for good reason  I'd probably dumb shit like this too if Russell Westbrook was the best player on my team.
"Two years ago, my friends and I were debating whether Russell Westbrook was a top 5 players in the NBA.  I said that not only was he not a top 5 player, but that he wasn't even a top 5 PG.  I mention this, because my friends were with me on this until I said that Kyle Lowry was one of those 5 PGs better than Russell Westbrook, whereupon I got looks of doubt and confusion.    I bring this up now, because I can now definitely say that not only is Kyle Lowry better than Westbrook, but that he's one of the top five leaders in the NBA.  Dude made the right decision almost every time he got the ball, played his butt off on defense, and just straight up balled.  After all he's been through in his career, I can't imagine how great it'll feel if he finally gets a ring."
Part of me thought this was a swipe at the thunder and Russell Westbrook.

You must be kidding Lowry is not close to top 5. I highly rate his defence but he’s nothing special offensively and is definitely not top 5. I honestly wouldn’t say he’s top 10.  1. Steph 2. Dame 3. Kyrie 4. Westbrook 5. Simmons 6. Walker 7. Conley 8. CP3 9. Russell 10. Fox
"Stop what? Reminding you that Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden were all on the same team at one point not that long ago?  Because that's a thing. But not that long before that, OKC didn't have a team. The team was in Seattle. And not that long before that Oklahoma wasn't even a state is was just some land overrun by native Americans and buffalo. And way before that it was a shallow sea teaming with life and dominated by marine reptile predators like tylosaurus."
Did you forget that it's Russell Westbrook day?
Russell Westbrook says hi
Russell Westbrook did it’s just idiots have a short term memory
Currently: Russell Westbrook  All Time: Vince Carter
"Actually:  https://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/2019/04/canzano-damian-lillard-vs-russell-westbrook-battle-is-just-getting-started.html  &gt;“The funny thing is, off the court, me and Russ is real cool,” Lillard said."
but round numbers though. god gave humans 10 fingers to overrate russell westbrook.
https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/02/02/thunder-russell-westbrook-wont-punished-after-shoving-fan/302749002/  I think most people were on Westbrook’s side on this one
"&gt;You guys do know that if Kyle Lowry retaliated his career would most likely be over?   More likely, he'd receive no punishment for shoving Stevens. Just like Westbrook received [no punishment](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/02/02/thunder-russell-westbrook-wont-punished-after-shoving-fan/302749002/) for shoving a fan earlier this year."
For life??? You kidding me? Sell his stake??? Lol.. You know why the 'soft punishment' was handed down to him? Because he's not some regular guy like that jazz fan who hates russell westbrook to the core. Those are the kind of people who shouldnt be close to these players. This dude touched lowry's arm. got thrown out. realized that's stupid. apologized and accepted his punishment. that should be the end of it.
"The Jazz fan was banned for life for his racist comments to Russell Westbrook. Donald Sterling was forced to give up the team due to his racist comments and was banned for life.  This is a minority owner of the team, putting his hands on a player by pushing him and then yelling ""go fuck yourself"" to Kyle multiple times.   Ban him for life and force him to sell his shares in the team.  Now?   He misses being courtside for only a year and continues to profit off the NBA after pushing and then verbally harassing an employee of the league."
[Yes](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2757420-fan-who-approached-russell-westbrook-after-nuggets-win-banned-from-future-games.amp.html)
He was cameron payne to lebron james's russell westbrook during his cavs tenure lol  All i remember him for is the dancing on the sidelines with bron
"Are they overreacting in a bubble? Sure.  But with Russell Westbrook earlier this year and the push to get players more respect from the fans where they're not just looked as object of entertainment you can say or do anything you want to, it's a bad look for a part-owner of a franchise to do this to a player."
"Assuming you’re not just being deliberately ignorant, it’s because the players are subject to the terms of the contract they signed to play within the guidelines of the NBA rulebook. The fans are held to a much different standard and can be kicked out, banned for a season or banned for life depending on the severity of the behaviour. 2 fans at a Jazz game were permanently banned this season after a verbal exchange with Russell Westbrook which included racially charged insults. Pretty sure putting your hands on a player during a game falls squarely in the category of ‘things fans shouldn’t ever do’ along with being racist assholes."
But calling Russell Westbrook “boy” warrants one. See the Utah Jazz about that.
"CJ McCollum, Jeremy Lin, and Jaylen Brown are all incredibly smart which would give them a leg up imo when it comes to coaching.   McCollum is a NBPA VP, Lin got into Harvard on his academics, and Jaylen is also a NBPA VP. I should've also gone with Brogdon but I forgot about him. Other guys who are off the court smart like Javale McGee, Russell Westbrook, and LeBron just didn't come off as the types to be HCs like the other guys."
For a knicks fan you sure post a lot about russell westbrook
"Come on now, this is disrespectful to Russell Westbrook, an MVP-level (and winning) player. Russ has a much higher ceiling, and is 3 years younger. I'll take Russ every single time."
Can I get a tranquilized Russell Westbrook?
My two favourite nba players are Draymond Green and Russell Westbrook
"They came away with bad players because they have trash scouting.   There are All-Stars and solid players taken outside the top 3 in every single draft. I’m not giving these teams a pass because they made a “consensus” pick and it turned out to be wrong  Russell Westbrook was widely considered a reach at #4, the Thunder did their due diligence and felt comfortable taking him there. If I’m another team, instead of complaining about the lotto system maybe I try to hire some guys from the Thunder or find out what their scouts are doing differently from others to gain an advantage."
Let me introduce you to Russell Westbrook
The old Russell Westbrook
That’s a 2016-17 Russell Westbrook statline
Is anyone else surprised to see Russell Westbrook with Celtics flair?
"Allen Iverson, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden agree with you."
"As a Lakers fan I wouldnt try anything for Russell WestBrook, even if we can get him on free I would be against it. I dont want a liability in my team especially with that salary"
"The stat that says Russell Westbrook had the greatest season of all time, and that it's not even close? Really?"
"Kobe always had the green light and loved heat checks.  The closest comparable today would be Russell Westbrook, who has hit 8 three pointers in a game twice despite a career three point shooting average of .308 and an average of 3.6 attempted threes per game.  I could totally believe Westbrook would set a new record of 14 threes in a game someday, even if his career average does not improve."
The Celtics should make Bill a court side super fan and have him down there talking shit to all the players. Can you imagine Bill Burr and Draymond Green or Russell Westbrook getting into it? Bill Burr slinging trash talk at Joel Embiid? I’d pay good money to mic that man up.
"I wouldn't say all , only the guys who were 1-and-dones. Looking at last year's All-Star roster, there are quite a few multi-year college players:   Curry, Harden, Kawhi, PG, Westbrook, Lillard, Klay, Lowry, Oladipo, Middleton  None of those guys were ranked highly enough after HS to jump straight to the NBA. Even without the 1-and-done rule in place they probably still go to college for a few years.   D'Angelo Russell is an interesting borderline example. Most 1-and-dones know going into the season that they're leaving. Russell was expected to stay at Ohio St for a couple years, but he had a ridiculous freshman season and shot up draft boards so he left ASAP."
&gt;Russell Westbrook could play for free and they would still be over the cap  oooof..
I Defend Russell Westbrook daily
"&gt; So he shouldn’t be in the bball hof (which is the easiest hof to get into in major sports) because he put up “empty stats” on mediocre teams? Not every hall of fame player is lucky enough to play on championship teams and great organizations.  No, I'm saying that the HOF should be changed to keep mediocre stars like Melo out.   &gt;Not every hall of fame player is lucky enough to play on championship teams and great organizations.  A great player should be able to do more than get to the playoffs a few times and lose consistently.   &gt;Sure, melo might not have been the best team player  An understatement  &gt; but he was one of the greatest offensive players of his generation  was he tho? he certainly scored a lot, and led his teams nowhere. is russell westbrook one of the best passing point guards in the league? no. same idea here."
"What about when Russell Westbrook was up for his new contract? I heard Laker fans thought he'd come back since he's from the area and played for UCLA. What about Lamarcus Aldridge? Heard you guys highlighted the aspects of LA and celebrity status more than basketball in your pitch. What about the Dwight Howard and 'Stay'?  And PG's contract hit FA last year? He could've come to the Lakers if he wanted, but decided against it."
Russell Westbrook James Harden Kawhi Leonard Giannis Antetokounmpo Anthony Davis
"&gt; I can recall countless road trips looking around the arena in Salt Lake City and being shocked by the faces of hate glaring back from the crowd. Every away building is a hostile environment with passionate fans rooting for the home team and sometimes crossing the line. But in Utah, it’s different. There are abundantly clear racial undertones to the heckling that seem to hover in the arena.  https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/15/russell-westbrook-fan-abuse-utah-jazz-racist"
"Good point, I feel Klay could be higher ranked if he was on a team where he was the leader. However, Anthony Davis, Jokic, Paul George. Kyrie and Kemba were on All-NBA teams. Maybe even Russell Westbrook (despite his hate he can really go off.) Some other guys around his ranking: Draymond Green, Ben Simmons (if not now then soon), Gobert, Jimmy Butler (probably not). DEFINITELY those first three are ahead of him, so there. I'm not hating on Klay, but objectively there is no way he is top 10."
Are you actually going to provide insight as to why you don’t think he can do those things?   Russell Westbrook completely dominates usage.
Trae Young will be a household name like Russell Westbrook very soon. Everything about his game seems to be pointing toward a perennial all star and fan favorite.
Fun fact: Russell Westbrook could play for free and they would still be over the cap
"Westbrook, CP3, and Lowry all fell off in a big way in rankings this year, and most of the time Harden is omitted.  Simmons is usually in the teens range and some people will count him as a Forward.  Also to be clear I'm not talking about ranking assets or potential, I'm talking ""win-now"" rankings.  The freshest one in my memory is the two guys from the Dunc'd On podcast who had Conley at #5 and #6 if I recall correctly.  I think if I had to say what I thought the ""consensus rankings"" was, it's like this:  1.  Curry 2.  Lillard 3.  Kyrie 4.  Jrue Holiday 5.  Kemba Walker 6.  Mike Conley 7.  Russell Westbrook 8.  After this point there's like 12 guys you can mix and match"

Here's his analysis of Vanderbilt's Darius Garland,  Yardbarker's No. 5 draft prospect.   More reports:  No. 4 prospect De'Andre Hunter | No. 5 Jaxson Hayes  DRAFT NIGHT AGE: 19  HEIGHT: 6-2 | WEIGHT: 175 | WINGSPAN:  6-5  2019 RAW NUMBERS (Totals per game)  GP | MIN | PTS | REB | STL | AST | TO   5       27.8    16.2     3.8      0.8    2.6      3.0  His game  A dozen years ago, a 6-foot-2 teenager entering the professional ranks with a score-first mentality would be considered, at best, a combo guard. In today’s NBA, where Damian Lillard, Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook have been catalysts for change at the position, Garland is without a doubt a point guard.  Although his time at Vanderbilt ended after just five games because of a meniscus tear, Garland gave us glimpses of an impressive skill set. He combines an airtight handle with a shifty style that can leave defenders spinning like a top. Also blessed with good first-step quickness, Garland should be difficult to keep out of dangerous areas at the NBA level.  Where Garland can get on the floor won’t matter as much as what he does when he’s there. Garland isn’t anywhere near the class of an above-the-rim finisher like Westbrook. He instead relies on sneaky flips, flicks and extended layups -- tricky shots that require a lot of skill to make consistently. Garland’s finishing leaves something to be desired, but that doesn’t mean he won't improve.  Garland’s main scoring weapon is his jumper. Any stats from just a handful of games should always ring the “small-sample size” alarm bell. In the case of his jump shot, Garland's 2018-19 cameo at the Division I level certainly gives reason for optimism.  &gt; Garland excels as a three-point shooter, knocking down nearly half (47.8 percent) of his 23 attempts last season. Garland also made 55.9 percent of all jumpers -- both catch-and-shoot and off-the-dribble -- that he took in 2018-19. That's an elite mark no matter the level.  &lt; Perhaps most impressively, Garland ranked in the top 1 percent of all college basketball players shooting off the dribble. He posted an absurd return of 1.348 points per possession (PPP) when letting it fly off the bounce. To put that number into perspective, Steph Curry was the best in the NBA at such shots, posting a 2018-19 mark of 1.164 PPP. Again, producing such a mark in just a handful of college games guarantees nothing. It definitely doesn’t mean Garland has a better jump shot than perhaps the best shooter in the world. It mostly hints that Garland could step onto an NBA floor with an elite skill."
We can't all be Russell Westbrook
"No but I believe he took some questionable and uncharacteristic shots.  It also doesn't help that this was a thing looming in the Thunder locker room:  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/07/kevin-durant-draymond-green-warriors-thunder-video  &gt;The report Green is most likely referencing is Adrian Wojnarowski’s podcast in which Woj reported that Russell Westbrook and Thunder teammates were “bothered” by Green’s friendship with Durant, especially during the playoffs series. It should be noted that Woj never said that Durant and Green spoke during the playoffs — he said the two had been in contact “all season long.”  &gt;Regardless of what was reported, Green said he doesn’t care, and he added that false reports don’t anger him, they make him happy.  &gt;“It doesn’t bother me to see a report like that from either side, because at the end of the day, I’m gonna talk to who I want to talk to and when I want to talk to them. But, nonetheless, they were wrong, and that makes me smile.”"
"Everyone is caught up in the three pointer. DeRozan scores about 1.24 points per shot. That’s better than Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook, CJ McCollum, and D’Angelo Russell. That’s just at first glance too. It’s also in the same ballpark as Kemba Walker and Kylie Irving. However, I never see any of these players get as much hate for the shots they take as DeRozan. As I said in an earlier post, Derozan is also top ten in free throw attempts among guards, so he’s at least above average there. The hate is absolutely unwarranted. The man did all this while having career highs in rebounds and assists. DeRozan is also pretty great at limiting his turnovers for the amount of usage he gets.  I get it. He isn’t Curry and he isn’t Durant, but not everyone is, and the hate he gets for not being one of those players is so unnecessary."
*Russell Westbrook has entered the chat*
notice how bronny boy isn't 5 feet behind the line. Russell Westbrook faces a crowded paint too. Congrats on lebron being as good as westbrook.
"Gonna be difficult for him to even find a long term contract right now.  &amp;#x200B;  Orlando truly looks like the only real fit for him to get decent starter money.  &amp;#x200B;  ATL has Young, CHA has Walker, MIA has Dragic, WAS has Wall + whoever starts next year (they cant afford Rubio as it is), CHI will draft Garland, CLE has Sexton, DET has Jackson, MIL has Bledsoe, IND might re-sign Collison, if not MAYBE they get Rubio, TOR has Lowry, BOS has Irving OR Rozier, PHI has Simmons, BKN has Russell, NYK has Smith Jr., MEM will draft Morant, NOP don't have a PG right now so MAYBE they get him, SAS has Murray, HOU has Paul/Harden, DAL has Doncic/Whoever plays offball, PHO drafts White, SAC has Fox, Lakers have Balls, Clippers re-sign Beverly, GSW has Curry, POR has Lillard, DEN has Murray, UTH doesn't want him back, OKC has Westbrook, MIN has Rose/Teague.  Lots of maybes, so he will have to get a little fortunate with where other teams choose to take their PG situations. He might be had as a backup anywhere not named Orlando. Indiana and New Orleans look like decent fallback options. Oladipo and Holiday are very good players with or without the ball."
That’s a Russell Westbrook way of looking at it.
Russell Westbrook likes his PBJ sandwich to be cut at a 45° angle  And it always has to be 45
The Russell Westbrook of commentators
"""Russell Westbrook, NBA MVP of fashion.""  Dude wearing shitty pair of Converse with a bum's dusty sweatshirt and some nylon mesh shorts.  GTFO with all that."
Honestly I wish we could’ve had that Russell Westbrook commercial but with Tim Duncan. Dude had the funniest fashion ever
Why is Russell Westbrook in an MIB movie and not a TMNT one
No shit people would take Bill Russell over Westbrook. I’m talking about people taking Westbrook over Draymond
"Except Russell was better than Draymond, and smart fans would take Russell over Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook wins
I guess this comes up a lot but based on his college career I thought Russell Westbrook would be an NBA journeyman.
Would you rather have Draymond Green or Kemba Walker on your team? Russell was a rich man's Draymond and Wilt was a bigger Russell Westbrook.
To put it in perspective.. guaranteed money  Steph curry  166 million Chris Paul 160 million Russell Westbrook 159 million James harden 153 million
"Russell Westbrook isn't a scoring threat anymore. His athleticism is falling off quickly (he's not as explosive as he used to) and his jump shot is somehow getting worse and worse as well, to the point where defenders literally leave him wide open and he still can't hit the ocean."
Russell Westbrook's 47% TS this year was only 1% below Iverson's legendary playoff run.   Iverson has a career playoff number of 49% TS. In 5 of his 8 playoff runs he has been below 50%. The three where he was above were all first round losses. He has only shot above 40% from the field in 4 playoff runs.   Westbrook isn't an efficient scorer. But he's also not only a scorer. And he's still more efficient than Iverson.
Russell Westbrook on a farm is a dope song
"Yeah this is great analysis agree across the board Was actually surprised to see Tatum do so well in man to man defensive data, eye test wise always considered him decent in that area but his real strength being his rotations and help defense. Smart player on both ends.   I agree his strength is an issue and in particular in that series vs Giannis he just gets bludgeoned anytime he was in his way at all. Was not great.   His versatility is one of his major assets, legit can be asked to be hte primary guy defending 1-4 for stretches of games. I think its matchup specific with him you can see here [even vs a 4 like Siakam when guarding him this year he was fine did pretty well](https://on.nba.com/2N97WQH) but regarding players whom he struggles with I think it''s more those with a physical mindset than necessarily super big guys which kind of gets at what your discussing here.   Paul George is an interesting one, defensive IQ might be there but PG is just so good at getting over screens using his length and moving laterally at his size it's a tough ask. That's the other thing I think with Tatum is when he has issues it can be with guarding 1s: he had some issues chasing Kyle Lowry in the past around and Russell Westbrook is an ex of a type who went by him without alot of resistance with quickness when he had to defend him in the past.   It's kind of crazy we are even talking about Tatum potentially having that kind of defensive ceiling considering what he was considered on that end coming out 2 yrs ago. Even the people high on him were like ""He can be average and a non issue on that end"" him actually being a legitimate defensive asset definitely is a surprise but it is true. I do think because of what I was talking about regarding his help defense he probably is best in the role he's had given teh task of guarding above average scoring types but staying away from the best scorers in the league most nights."
That word is Russell Westbrook.
"Even in context, that doesn't add up with the stuff he has said in numerous other interviews.   The cupcake game happened on February 11, 2017.    From a Lee Jenkins profile on Paul George from July 11, 2017  [https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/11/paul-george-thunder-trade-kevin-durant-lakers-pacers-russell-westbrook](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/11/paul-george-thunder-trade-kevin-durant-lakers-pacers-russell-westbrook)   ""KD was like, 'That place (Oklahoma City) will blow you away.' He told me, 'They can offer what other teams can't in terms of the people and the preparation and the facility, down to the chefs and the meals.' He was pretty high on (the Thunder). He thought it was a first-class organization in every way,"" George said  Some quotes from another interview, from Nov. 16, 2017:   [https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kevin-durant-okc-blue-blood-forever/story?id=51204319](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kevin-durant-okc-blue-blood-forever/story?id=51204319)   After he left, Durant seemed to have an icy relationship with those he left behind, including former teammate Russell Westbrook.  He says he has come around, and that ""me and my family didn't erase those eight years in OKC.""   ""I am OKC. I'm still OKC,"" Durant told Bleacher Report. ""That blue is going to be in my blood forever. That place raised me. I have people there who would take a bullet for me and vice versa. ""   ""I didn't have that perspective at first. I didn't have it when I went back to OKC. I was like, 'F--- all of them,'"" Durant said. ""I didn't have it when they gave my number away. I was, 'F--- all of them.' My best friend works for the team, I told him, 'F--- all y'all. That's f---ed up.' Then I had to get out of my head, tell myself, 'It's not that serious, it is what it is.' ""   ""If I was on my death bed, I guarantee you \[Thunder owner\] Sam Presti and Russell Westbrook would come check on me. So I'm going to look at it that way rather than the other way.""   If he found the treatment from the organization to be so bad after he left why did he say *anything* positive about the organization, for years afterwards? I don't think he's lying but he seems to remember things in a way that justifies however he feels at any given moment."
"Because KD played with the likes of Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Steven Adams, and Enes Kanter in 2016. LeBron was playing with fat Shaq, Antawn Jamison, and Mo Williams in 2010. Do you really not see the difference between those two supporting casts?"
He is a whiny little bitch. Next he is going to accuse Russell Westbrook of man spreading in the locker room and pushing toxic masculinity.   He is going to fucking love new york if he sucks and doesn't fully recover from his injury. Oh yeah. Will go well. Are there still 7 daily news papers in New York?   Then Durant will leave for Philthydelphia to be around less toxic fans.
Yet Russell Westbrook is beloved there and always will be.
"How could you say this on Russell Westbrook day, which is everyday in okc city. Russell Westbrook also happens to be black."
"Derrick Rose absolutely was not a top 10 point guard (Curry, Lillard, Irving, Westbrook, Walker, Simmons, Lowry, Conley, Paul, Russell, Fox, Young, Murray, Bledsoe all had better seasons) but definitely showed he still has a lot to offer. At the end of the day though he’s a very poor defender, an improved yet inconsistent outside shooter, and is still unfortunately injury prone (he’s only played 76 games over the past two seasons). Those are three things teams value a lot from their rotation players. It isn’t 2011 anymore. There’s a reason why he has only played one playoff series since 2015. Don’t get me wrong, I love Derrick Rose. You were right in saying he is smarter and more skilful than ever before and still has the quickness to blow by defenders but teams like having a backup point guard who can play defence, hit threes on a consistent basis, and don’t struggle injury-wise. Hopefully, he can carve out a solid role in Detroit similarly to Minnesota and cap off what is potentially a Hall of Fame career (given guys like Calvin Murphy, Bill Walton, and Jamaal Wilkes are in the Hall, I believe D-Rose will scrape in)."
"Be more pedantic.  Lamar Odom is really comparable to Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kanter, and Roberson."
"He went from Oklahoma, super reliant on O&amp;G, to Houston, even more reliant on O&amp;G. Is Russell Westbrook causing climate change?"
"Unbelievable that Kwame Brown, Smush Parker, Luke Walton, Sasha Vujacic wasn’t enough help for that bum.  KD *only* had Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Steven Adams, Andre Roberson, and Kanter.  **Kobe was soft, KD would have led that 2005-06 Lakers roster to a championship**"
"I feel like ""great"" should be reserved for the top 10 at the position.  Ergo, to be a great Point Guard, he would have to be one of the 10 best PGs in the league.  Guys I'd take ahead of Rubio, in no order:  1. Steph Curry * De'aaron Fox * Damian Lillard * Mike Conley * Jamal Murray * Dejounte Murray * Russell Westbrook * Jrue Holiday (although, could argue he's not a PG) * Kyrie Irving * Kemba Walker * Malcom Brogdon (same as Holiday) * Kyle Lowry  That doesn't even include the newer guys like Trae Young and Ja Morant, who are definitely going to improve and could be better than Rubio in the very near future.  I went to 12 guys just in case people wanted to argue against Holiday and Brogdon being PGs, so I would still have 10."
"Those aren’t even the best players, don’t know what thought process leads someone to name Russell Westbrook and not Giannis, Embiid, AD, or the guy who outplayed Westbrook on his own team last year. Or use Westbrook as an example of why a guy who outplayed him both in the regular season and directly in the playoffs isn’t a superstar."
"it's not just about quality, it's about fit. How many players in the NBA would win a title playing next to Russell Westbrook. Lebron and that's it? Who else besides Lebron?"
All Ninja-Style Bands team :  PG: Rajon Rondo  SG: Russell Westbrook  SF: Carmelo Anthony  PF: Julious Randle  C: Marcin Gortat
"Because if you don’t establish some set of regulations, there will always be someone pushing it farther and farther.   At the end of the day, players are employees of the NBA. Russell Westbrook can wear a velvet traffic cone from his car to the locker room but once you’re on the clock representing your company, there’s always going to be some restrictions."

Chris Paul and Blake Griffin as Spurs. Pretty much those Clippers teams under Popovich  Russell Westbrook playing for Spoelstra
"This is sound support for it.  They’re very hard to nab but I can see if beyond being grabbed if they hit a players eye while they’re in the air or gets untied and falls on the ground causing a player to slip on it, those could be potential scenarios that pushed them to the decision.  Although if taking a risk based view, the odds are very low of those things happening but maybe they have quantifiable support.  Who knows.  They just look cool and are way more comfortable than headbands.  I was just looking forward to seeing head tie x hair braids Russell Westbrook this season."
Or maybe the other way around... we should take context into matter when discussing Russell Westbrook  He gets far too much hate :(
"Deion wasn't exceedingly tall, also center halves generally tend to be on the taller end. Imagine guys like Odell Beckham, or Russell Westbrook. Explosive athletes that aren't size reliant. The fact is our top athletes have many many more opportunities than soccer, and choose as such. Across the world the rest of the top tier athletes play soccer almost full stop."
Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka."
"Jokic doesn’t take shots at the rim or shots on drives (the best way to get fouled) at anywhere near the level Giannis or Embiid do, especially Giannis who does it at least twice as much on both counts while also being a lot better at it.  There’s no comparison to be made here, far and away the main reason he doesn’t get the calls they do is that he doesn’t play the same way he does. May as well be asking why John Stockton or Steve Nash never got as many calls as Russell Westbrook."
"&gt;all the top guards such as Curry, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Damian Lillard and many more find themselves in May and June basketball all the time.    Kemba Walker, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal would all like a conversation with OP"
"Actually Westbrook *is* also recovering from surgery, as [he had surgery on his hand and on his right knee back in May](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/05/07/okc-thunder-russell-westbrook-injury-update-surgery-finger-knee-offseason/) when PG had his shoulder surgeries. That knee surgery marked the 6th such surgery he's had on that knee since 2013."
"&gt;One of the easiest stars, not players.  I'm about to name fifteen 2015 all-stars easier to stop than Stephen Curry and I want you to point out which is actually harder to stop -   Marc Gasol  D Wade  Carmelo Anthony  John Wall  Kyle Lowry  Paul Millsap  Al Horford  Chris Bosh  Jimmy Butler  Klay Thompson  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  DeMarcus Cousins  Blake Griffin  &gt;And Iggy shot better than Curry for the series(10 less points of course) had a much better assist to turnover ratio and guarded LeBron better than anyone ever has.  Do you think that had something to do with Iguodala being open on most of his looks and not being pressured as a ball handler? How many double teams did Iguodala have to pass out of? How difficult were his field goals when 88% of them were assisted compared to 36% for Curry?  &gt;Curry only played well in the second half of games once Delly was in a coma because he was asked to to play starter minutes and run the offense when LeBron wasn't even though he had only been a back up defensive specialist at that point in his career.  That's a nice narrative you've crafted there. If you think Curry played like shit in the 2015 finals, your evaluation of basketball cannot be taken seriously. At all. That's how bad of a take this is."
Giving Russell Westbrook space to drive to the rim is a terrible idea  That’s 2 every possession

Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook fully deserved to won’t the 2017 MVP. I get that Harden was the more efficient player and had more team success, and triple doubles are truly an arbitrary stat, but a couple points go overlooked.  1. Those who say Westbrook stat padded are indeed correct, he definitely chased rebounds and very occasionally an assist, when the game had already been decided. But two counters to that: one, he was still easily the best rebounding guard in the NBA, take off a couple rebounds a game and the dude’s still 6’3” averaging over eight boards a game while carrying his team; two, fans from the *opposing* team would come to games holding up signs and root for Westbrook to get a triple double and break Oscar Robertson’s record — if your a player who walks into an arena and sees fans, from both your team and the opposing team, come to see you get a triple double and your a rebound or two short, of course your gonna give a little extra to grab that rebound. This is just common sense.  2. Russell Westbrook was otherworldly clutch that year. I don’t know the number off the top of my head but his clutch-time rating was absurd that year. I’ll be the first to admit that Russ is by no means a clutch player, but for whatever reason, in 2017 he was the most clutch player I have ever seen, maybe after Kobe. It seemed like once a week, Russ would carry OKC back from a double digit fourth quarter deficit and will his team to wins. There’s not stat for “willing your team” to a win, but if you watched OKC basketball that year, you would know that nobody was quite doing what Russ was doing that year.  I know you can show me advanced stats, efficiency numbers, and point to wins to tell me Harden deserved MVP, but nothing replaces watching the games. I watched the games, and that was the best MVP season I’ve seen in a while. Harden was outstanding and close to flawless that year, but, though he is flawed, Westbrook had an irreplicable year with his insanely clutch play, carrying a young team with a lot of new faces,  and putting up monster numbers."
"This isn’t soccer, where people care about the World Cup. Americans don’t care about FIBA. Paul George (1st team all nba) , James Harden(1), Steph Curry(1), Kevin Durant(2), Kawhi Leonard (2), Damian Lillard (2), Kyrie Irving (2), Blake Griffin (3), LeBron James(3), and Russell Westbrook (3) are not participating. Kemba Walker(3) is the only American All-NBA player participating. That’s 1/11 and he’s arguably the worst of them.   Americans somewhat care about the Olympics. They can sometimes get around 50% participation from the top players."
That Russell Westbrook is good
"Cam Payne is a young, dynamic point guard with a wicked jumpshot who learned under one of the best point guards in the last decade, Russell Westbrook. He’s also a fantastic locker room presence known to be able to lighten the mood of any situation with his energy. A fabulous young man for sure"
A.J. Slaughter with his Russell Westbrook percentages. Nice.
The statistics argument is tired. Russell Westbrook and James Harden have had far better stats than Lebron for the past 3-4 season. Would anyone consider either of those two as the better player?
"99% of people here have no idea how good he actually was so he gets forgotten. Personally I have no idea how to rank a guy like him. Same with Wilt and Russell, it’s all reputation and Westbrook breaking his unbreakable record definitely didnt help."
Dame also refuted that Russell Westbrook is not the best player in the NBA and his triple double stats are derived from athleticism and heart.
"Russell Westbrook is only 6'3"" and we all know he can dunk."
2010 was a good example of this as well:  Kevin Durant  Derrick Rose  Russell Westbrook  Andre Iguadala  Steph Curry  Kevin Love  Those guys were all decidedly better in the next season
"Because people realized ""averaging a triple double"" doesn't necessarily mean anything concrete in contributing to winning basketball as shown by how terrible russell Westbrook was this season. After all its just an arbitrary stat."
"Russell Westbrook, I honestly can’t even tell you if he’s overrated or underrated"
"Before leading the league in minutes every year caught up with him/caused him to pace himself, AI really was a generational athlete.  He was like a skinnier Russell Westbrook.  His Georgetown highlights are nuts. Really was something in the water in the Hampton Roads area at that time."
Russell Westbrook played 67 games lmao..  that wasn't willing a team to the playoffs.    What Russ did 2 years later was willing a team to the playoffs. How can you carry a roster to the playoffs that proved it could make it without you
"You’re misunderstanding me, I’m not saying team B would lose, I’m saying team B has absolutely horrendous shooting. Two guys on the entire team who shoot above league average, one of whom only shoots on corner catch and shoot threes, and only two more who can shoot at league average on any kind of volume, is awful. You couldn’t name a single team in the league worse than that.  It worked for the Rockets because a) Chris Paul is a *significantly* better shooter than Russell Westbrook and b) Harden shot like 12 threes a game and hit them pretty well, which Giannis absolutely won’t do."
"Ah yes Russell Westbrook, famous for caring about shot efficiency numbers"
Don't let Russell Westbrook hear this
"This year, being hounded by one of the best perimeter defenders in the league and as the only scoring option on his team, but last year, he outdueled Russell Westbrook as a rookie and sent the Thunder home."
larry a mutiple time champion. russell westbrook not a champion. narrative changes when you.  also 80s basketball was alot more inefficient plus alot more physical.
"He doesn't bend his knees when he shoots jump shots, which robs him of balance. It's basically BOING then FLICK.  His footwork is imprecise, and his feet are usually too close together when he jumps. So he sways in the wind, re-adjusting with every bump and angle, BUT with no power because the energy from jumping essentially stops at his knees. He relies on his wrists and forearms to do all the heavy lifting AND fine-tuning. This hurts repeatability, and ultimately reduces shot arc due to fatigue.  Westbrook's release isn't awful and his elbows are usually tucked, and he undoubtedly wants to be a better shooter (if only to stop having to hear about it). With a little tinkering (wider base, bent knees, looser shoulders, maybe starting the shooting motion earlier), he could shoot a respectable 37-38% on at least open 3s. And if Russell Westbrook becomes a real 3-threat, his Saturn 5 launches toward the rim will be that much easier for him. I'm rooting for you, Russ!"
russell westbrook.
The Russell Westbrook double clutch reverse back in those early OKC years. The dude is 6’3 but dunking like hes 6’10 lol
Russell Westbrook is another with a clear two motion jump shot. I’ve noticed that there’s a lot more variability with a two motion jump shot than with one. Way less consistent particularly in late game where there’s less hop in the legs

"Shoutout to u/yoshi122 for original link  Interviewer (I): After free agency began, you've talked about the difficulties you faced, can you tell us more about how you felt?  Jeremy Lin (JL): During my whole basketball career, especially the nine years in the NBA, I feel that 80 to 90 percent of it has been low points or periods of difficulty. I know my personality - I've never been afraid to dream big since I was a kid, and I've never been afraid to chase big dreams. If I have my mind set on something I'll just work hard to go for it. Basketball-wise, what I've always wanted is to become the player I feel that I can be. Although the nine years in the NBA was hard, but I'm very grateful and fulfilled. Yet I also know that I have not become the player I know that I can be.  I: You've talked a lot about how your motivation is not money or status but to achieve your potential/become the player you know you can. So what is the highest level you feel you're able to reach? To play in the NBA or to be a superstar or to be a starter on a contending team etc?  JL: Sometimes I don't really have a clear or specific answer to that. But vaguely/generally speaking, I've always felt I can be a very good NBA starting point guard. My strengths are: I'm a good leader, I can control the game, I can make my teammates better - these have been my strengths since I was a kid. I still feel I'm able to be a starting NBA point guard on a playoff team. When it comes to aiming for stats/numbers, being a star, or winning a championship, I can't say for sure. But at the end of the day I just want a chance. I'm not on the level of Steph Curry or Russell Westbrook, but I'm not a end of the bench player , not the 12th to 15th man on a roster. I could maybe be among a team's top three options.   I: Besides sadness and regret, do you also feel that you've been treated unfairly? Do you feel any bitterness?  JL: It depends on your point of view. From a young age, playing ball in the USA as an Asian, I've always been treated unfairly. I've long since understood how it is, and gotten used to it. Ever since I was a kid, whenever I played well, people wouldn't say 'he played well' as much as 'his opponent was weak'...  I: At what age did this start?  JL: Age didn't matter. It happened from start to finish/all the time. So from one point of view I can say that it's unfair, and be unhappy about why I played well before the draft/during the combine but still didn't get drafted. But I feel that at the end of the day, I did have a chance to play in the league, I had control over my own performance. If I didn't perform well, it wouldn't matter if I was treated fairly or not. Life is not fair anyway. As for my situation right now, it is what it is. I'm still focusing on myself, preparing myself to be the best I can be, and to try to be positive every day, to have an more grateful outlook/attitude on things."
"You could make this argument about most star PG's in the league, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, Kyrie, Kemba, etc, etc. The leagues evolved to the point where the ""point guard"" position doesn't really mean anything anymore, depending on the offense the team runs.  Especially with the warriors, the layout is wing players, ball handlers, and screeners. The game is so much more fluid now than it was in the 90's this constant need to compare players based on position isn't fair."
"Jordan is better than Lebron because X (usually never lost in Finals, better scorer, more “clutch”, etc...)  Lebron is a cancer to his team (this has never made sense as the man literally went to 8 consecutive Finals with 2 separate teams who both faded into obscurity once he left)   Russell Westbrook sucks (again, literally a top 10 player every single year)"

"In no specific order;   Curry, Irving, Westbrook, Paul, Lillard, Walker, Lowry, Murray, Wall, Simmons  Not including Harden because even though he obviously plays PG he won’t this upcoming season probably.  Russell, Holiday are up there too."
"He's a really poor man's Russell Westbrook.  Similar potential skill set, physical build...but the issue is with the way NBA is going emphasizing shooting on the perimeter, it's gonna be tough for him unless he is the primary ball handler.  He won't be with Barrett so he's gotta develop a shot and be able to play off-ball."
Nobody picks on Chris Paul defensively. He was the Clippers best defender on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in the 2014 playoffs. Chris Paul was a better post defender then Magic as well. You clearly haven’t watched Chris Paul play and you’re judging defensively ability on height.
Yet Russell Westbrook won mvp with a shitty team.
"When you say not to give you Zach Lowe's thoughts, do you mean don't provide any stats or analysis for why Westbrook's contract is worse? Because Zach Lowe lays it out pretty concretely in the video I linked to above (did you even bother to watch it?).   You say Westbrook isn't as injury prone, but are you aware that Westbrook has had six separate knee surgeries on his right knee in the last 6 years? If so, does that not concern you going forward as Westbrook continues into his mid-30s? Just look at how drastically his play fell off last season if you think all those knee surgeries aren't having an effect on a player who's overall effectiveness has always been predicated on his explosive athleticism.   For years people have been worried about what Westbrook's game will look like as his athleticism begins to wane, because he has literally nothing else to offer since his jumpshot is the worst in the league (among players who took 3+ jumpers per game last year). Oops sorry, there I go using Zach Lowe's pesky stats again.  Chris Paul's game has started to decline drastically as well, but at least Paul has his jump shot to fall back on, and can still use his knowledge of running an offense to play productive basketball. What is Westbrook going to contribute this year either as an off ball player next to Harden, or by taking the ball out of the hands of the game's best iso player simply to cater to his declining skills?  Finally the biggest reason CP3's contract isn't as bad as Westbrook's is because it's shorter. Look at their contracts side by side and factor in how good each player was this past season and you tell me which one is worse:  [Chris Paul](https://i.imgur.com/h3FYCdt.png)  [Russell Westbrook](https://i.imgur.com/1hfBDmR.png)  Finally, even if you think you can make the argument that Chris Paul has the worse contract, is it really *so* much worse that it was worth it to give up two 1st round picks to swap it for Westbrook's? *That* is why I think the Lakers getting nothing for Zubac is preferable than giving up two 1st round picks to take on the 2nd worst contract in the league."

"The amount of times you’ve deflected is much more astounding. You could literally be Kellyanne Conway with the amount of times you’ve avoided arguments.  My only point is, Russell Westbrook is an all-star but is severely underrated because he doesn’t shoot efficiently like other guards in the league. No he’s not a great shooter, but he plays with the most hustle he’s a solid playmaker, and he’s always a team first guy. You calling him garbage shows you have no clue about basketball and just watch ESPN when you can."
Yeah. His playing style was [not a good match for the thunder’s offensive scheme. ](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21847919/how-carmelo-anthony-was-freezing-russell-westbrook-paul-george-thunder-offense-iso-melo-nba)  Is that a serious argument as to why he shouldn’t be on a roster? Because he negatively contributed to a team over a 10 game span?
"This is a literal google search for ""steph makes teammates better,"" the first result is literally a reddit thread of someone asking how much better Steph makes his teammates.  You're only proving my point, which is that you don't have one.   Here's an actual thing:  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/"
Harden for sure . Russell is a 2 guard in a PG body and James is the opposite even tho the scoring says otherwise. I used to say they should start Harden at point and move Westbrook to the 2 in OKC.
If I was just way better at basketball and ripped at my current height I'd basically be a less athletic Russell Westbrook

"Westbrooks top speed his MVP season at 28 years old was 21.6 mph, lebron for comparison was 20mph at the same age in probably his best ever season (2013).   Westbrooks highest jumping reach in the study was measured at 11 feet 6 inches, lebrons highest standing reach was 8 feet and 10 inches, and when coupled with his 44 inch vertical jump his highest reach would be 12 feet 6 inches. A foot higher, but lebron james is 5 inches taller and has a wingspan greater by 4.5 inches (7'0.025"" vs 6'7.75""). So lebron out jumps westbrook by just about 2.5 inches.   For durability, Westbrook never missed a single game until his 6th year. He has had 7 seasons of 80 games or more, and an 8th season of the full 66 game season during the lockout year. Lebron has rested since miami, but before that he still never played all 82 and in total has 3 80 game seasons in a 5 year longer career.   Lebron is stronger id say but explosiveness is very comparable. Honestly when you compare their pure athleticism, westbrook is very close to lebrons level and not more than a notch below  https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2013/05/28/espns-sports-science-proves-lebron-is-amazing-even-in-ways-that-dont-make-sense  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12588495/no-3-russell-westbrook  https://www.stack.com/a/lebron-james-sports-science"

"I see your point but you just keep confusing my point and conflating several things.. You even agreed with my point because we're talking about other work ethic and other players and you acknowledge it wasn't great, just that he was successful.  I do not disagree you. He was very successful and I don't know about Kobe's claim that his work ethic could carry him farther than four rings and 3fmvps.  Give DeAndre Jordans Shaq skillset he's a good player, not an NBA great. He doesn't have shaqs' intangibles nor his competitive drive let alone his physical attributes.  But we'll agree to disagree even though we agree?  I think you just don't like me saying he's not a hard worker even though you acknowledge it yourself. Maybe because you perceive as a slight. It's not.   I'm also saying some people just downplay talent. Like talent is even and yeah, everyone's talented. Kyler singler is just as talented as Russell Westbrook talent wise just because they're all in the NBA   Skill nor talent are on all equal level playing fields just because you're in the NBA. There are more skillful players than Shaq, they're just not as unstoppable. Jokic is not more dominant  than Shaq because he's a better passing, better shooter, high bbiq and so forth.  I"

"I'm Steph's height (maybe a smidgen taller) and my running vertical topped out around 35 inches. I feel like I can relate to a lot of his dunking approach.   First, like me, it appears Curry has a wingspan that comes close to equaling his height, like a normal human. That means dunking for us is literally like a normal 6-foot-3 person trying to dunk. Russell Westbrook, by comparison, has a 6-foot-8 wingspan, so while he may be 6-foot-3 in height, his proportions are more akin to someone several inches taller, which makes a significant difference when it comes to sniffing out dunking opportunities.   Second, on account of having a non-40-inch vertical and normal proportions, those bounce dunks and 360's in the layup line require fresh legs and close-to-max explosion. But once that game gets going, assuming he's running as hard all night as he should be, attaining max explosion often isn't in the cards. For me, I sometimes needed just the right circumstances to get a dunking opportunity in-game - usually with an open lane and usually at a time when I wasn't gassed from busting my tail super hard defensively for four consecutive possessions without a stoppage. If there was any doubt as to whether I'd be able to get up to dunk or not, I'd usually play it safe and lay it in if something was on the line.   Lastly, dunk style and hand size. Folks who can palm the ball like Kawhi (or even Brent Barry) barely need to clear the top of the rim to throw down. It's almost a little wrist flick at that point. Not to mention, palmers can easily abort the dunk attempt and turn it into a fingerroll no problem. Guys like Steph, meanwhile, need to be able to turn the ball over once they're up there, which means committing to the dunk attempt prior to takeoff and being certain you'll be able to get up higher than the palming folk in order to literally throw it down. Basically, non-palm rim grazers are full body endeavors and any disruption can kill the attempt (reach hand, the slightest change in direction).   In the NBA, all those circumstances do not frequently align, leading Curry to settle for the sure thing more times than not."

"I remember reading back then that analysis of Love's game showed that he was hunting rebounds, which did get him a lot of rebounds butt also meant that he was not in proper defensive positions on many possessions leading to easy opponent baskets, so overall a net negative. He was sort of the Russell Westbrook of power forwards, great numbers on the stat sheet but perhaps not helping his team to win."

Russell Westbrook is another one of the greatest athletes the league has ever seen. That doesn’t make him a top five player ever. That’s ridiculous.

"I'd rather face the 2018 Celtics with no Kyrie or Hayward than the 2018 Rockets with James Harden, Chris Paul and a great supporting cast.  I'd rather face the 2017 Celtics with Isaiah Thomas  than the 2017 Spurs with Kawhi Leonard and Gregg Popovich.  I'd rather face the 2016 Celtics with Isaiah Thomas than the 2016 OKC Thunder with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.  Like I said, he's always been a great player but he most likely loses when he faces a great team with higher team IQ."

KD won nothing with Russell Westbrook. He won’t win with Kyrie either. Simple reason:  there’s only one ball.   KD won at GSW because of the selfless attitudes-of Steph and Klay et al. It’s that simple.

Today's schemes revolve around team D and adjustments. Does having individual capabilities help with that? Sure. Is that more valuable than a young borderline all-star guard who is still developing? Hell no. Middleton is an example of ""old head mentality"". That ""If he can't at lockdown he's trash"" nonsense has been disproven time and time again. Look who the top PGs in the game happen to be:  1) Steph Curry (arguably the second best point guard in history already)  2) Dame Lillard  3) Kyrie Irving  4) Russell Westbrook  5) Kemba Walker  Notice a trend: They're all (statically speaking anyway) net negative defenders. D'Lo is a fringe top 10 guard already at 23. I'd take his contract over Midfleton's all day, everyday."
You're a Sonics fan who wants to take credit for Russell Westbrook? LOL.
Imagine a Russell Westbrook and curry backcourt lmao
Do you think Russell Westbrook is past his prime?
"this made me laugh harder than it should, then i saw your tag of ""OKC Russell Westbrook"" and laughed even harder."
"Although I question Stephen A Smith insider info I don't question his basketball knowledge.   He said KDs game isn't predicated on his Athleticism like Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, etc. His game is predicated on his jumpers. He may not play the level he was projected to but he'll still be solid. Golden State was offering him the max $200 mil. as well."
"Russell ""We're not shooting"" Westbrook"
Let's remember what matt Barnes said to Durant. The only player preventing you from winning the championship KD is your own teammate Russell Westbrook
Russell  .. ... WESTBROOK
Russell Westbrook: .......... WWHAT?
Russell Westbrook
"This just isn't true. Steph has not had to guard Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, even Kyrie for an entire series in the post season. His defense has been adequate since he's been appointed the lesser of defensive responsibilities always. Klay has always guarded the best opposing back court player now what?"
What? Ever heard of Russell Westbrook? He’s kind of a ball dominating point guard who has bad iq. No way he can conexist with CP3 who is a ball dominating point guard who has good iq
Is it bad that things are so convoluted right now that I just forgot the Thunder existed? Russell Westbrook and Paul George didn't even register in my mind as a legit contender.
Golden State about to develop Russell into Russell Westbrook
Is Russell Westbrook going to get traded to the Lakers to play with LeBron and AD?
Deangelo Russell Westbrook
The Warriors will just develop Russell into Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is beside himself
"Dude, you’re not getting the point (or you are and you’re just trying to deflect) We are tuning in to see Russell Westbrook dunk, not watch Joe Lacob eat crab cakes in his suite. Yes, the business side of everything is difficult to execute, but the product is what we are here for. If all the players defected, we would have a bunch of suits with their dicks in their hands."
"What the hell? Damian Lillard, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Nikola Jokic, DeMar Derozan aren’t superstars? Not to mention solid star CJ McCollum????? Okay...."
"Russell Westbrook is poor IQ, he gets triple doubles but it's in a way that's bad for his team. That's why he can never go far in the playoffs because he does too much but not intelligently even though he plays with superstars now and historically"
"Have you heard of the 3 point line?  Do you know russell westbrook is a terrible SHOOTER while Kevin Durant is, you know, one of the best.  Do you know the difference between scorers and shooters?  Are you secretly Sam Presti?"
"Despite the salty Nets fans asking to be reminded about this in the next 1-3 years, this is a reasonable assessment based on historical data.  We've seen KD play with a shoot first G before, where they take turns in going 1vs5, and Kyrie is not as good as Westbrook.  We've seen Kyrie pout about not being no 1 on the team. We've seen Kyrie pout even when he was (in theory) no 1 on the team.   KD is 31 and will probably miss a full season or most of it. Kyrie will have to carry the team, and I think he'll do worse than D'Angelo Russell. And if he does, he'll probably be frustrated again, be moody, and ruin the lockerroom. By the time KD comes back, it might be too late.  And if Kyrie kinda holds the fort and then KD comes back and they start winning and KD gets lots of praise, I can see Kyrie getting sour.   Oh, and DeAndre is washed."
That child’s name. Russell Westbrook
“48 inch vertical” lol I don’t even trust vertical measurements today much less from 50 years ago. Unless you want to believe Doug McDermott can jump higher than Russell Westbrook
Mans shooting like Russell Westbrook
"Hmm...well let's see, I think these guys are better(not in any order):  Jordan, Kobe, LeBron, Durant, CP3, Harden, Westbrook, Wade, Duncan, Moses Malone, Karl Malone, Stockton, Hakeem, Shaq, Isiah Thomas, Kareem, Wilt, Bill Russell, Dirk, Magic, Bird, Robinson, West, Dr J, Robertson, Iverson, Baylor, Gervin, Wilkins, Havlicek, Cousy  And I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys.....but no, Nash isn't top 25."
"&gt; thinking scoring titles are the ultimate determinant of who's better on offense  russell westbrook did this twice. is westbrook better offensive than kawhi?   if you say no, you're fucked. if you say yes, you're even more fucked by virtue of looking dumb as shit"
LeBron led the league in jersey sales with the Cavaliers for years. Curry and Durant are consistently near the top. Russell Westbrook has been top 5 for years. Kawhi with the Spurs was top 5. In fact for years before LeBron came to the Lakers they had no top 10 selling jersey. Something doesn't compute.
"""NBA players I've talked with so far:  Russell Westbrook &amp; Paul George."""
"Russell Westbrook dropping a 47 point quadruple double with turnovers against the Warriors in KDs return to OKC. Yeah they got their asses handed to them by KD but I’ve been a fan of OKC, Westbrook and the NBA since then. The atmosphere was straight up bonkers I never thought Americans outside of college sports could get so rowdy as a European"
Okay but what about someone like Russell Westbrook. Dude tries so hard to average a triple double and gets bumped out of the first round multiple times. Plus people were talking like OKC would be a super team.
"[No, it's not](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/russell-westbrook-6141/)"
Only because it’s Russell Westbrook
But then if we go check out vorp doesn't Russell Westbrook have the best season of all time?
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook becomes a full time fashion designer/model  Jerami Grant decides to live among the crab people  Paul George becomes a fisherman  Steven Adams becomes a stunt double for Jason Momoa  Raymond Felton chases his dream of being a spokesperson for McDonald’s
Russell Westbrook: full-time fashion mogul  Paul George: fisherman
That's purely cause of Russell Westbrook
He plays like he’s Russell Westbrook with half the talent and he wants $20 million/year. No thanks.
watch the video - it's great - but here are a couple:  Lerbon: The Man Who Takes Six Steps  Davis: The Bushy-Browed Man  George: Pickled Peppers  Westbrook: Ninja Turtle  Kobe: The King Who Strikes Iron  Howard: Magical Beast  Zach Randolph: Mashed Tofu  JaVale: Cringe God  Duncan: The Stone Buddha  Ginobli: The Devil's Blade  KG: King of the Wolves  Russell: Lord of the Rings  Shaq: O'Fatty  Barkley: Flying Pig

"It's crazy to think, but the 2007 UCLA Bruins had Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Luc Mbah a Moute, a whole bunch of Eurostars....  And yet Darren Collison was the Starting Captain who ran the offense.  Dude had so much potential. He had ths highest 3pt% and assist/turnover ration just a year ago in the league. Even if he was on the decline, he had a few years of role playing left."
Lol if MJ played today he'd basically be a worse version of Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook has two scoring titles. LMAO The blind hate is real
Russell Westbrook
Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook
Yes. I've written about it a ton. Here's my second story ever on The Ringer:  https://www.theringer.com/2016/8/24/16077506/oklahoma-city-thunder-russell-westbrook-road-map-256100e72769
"Fox has elite quickness and speed to legitimately push the tempo on every single play..think Russell Westbrook. The only ""problem"" with Fox is that he's not really aggressive in looking for his shot. His aggressiveness and 3pt shooting are the only things that give you pauses. On the other hand, Bagley demands for the ball on every possession. To a fault, he tries to score too much, but he's got the confidence like Kobe.   Build around the all-around better player, or the better scorer? With all of this being said, both players fit perfectly with eachother lol. I just wanted to see with KOC thinks."
"Do you think a mental toll has been taken on the young core of the Celtics after getting tossed into trade rumors seemingly every ither week for their entire careers? i cab't think of a single GM besides Ainge that either wants to try and get the best deal possible by being proactive even when there's no realistic chance of appealing teams with lowball offers, but surely this has to backfire somehow on the players?  is Ainge a lowballer? I only ask because he seems to get involved in every trade rumor. if trade rumors were jump shots, Ainge would be Russell Westbrook."
And it was Curry's year this year?  Dude missed almost 15 games this year and still got more votes then KD. Or how on earth do you put Embiid over KD this year?  Then last year we had Russell Westbrook and AD getting more votes then KD.  Then in 2017 we had friken John Wall with more votes then KD.
Westbrook 0 Wade 3 Kobe 8 Garnett 5 Russell 6
"Maybe because  those stats like rebounds and he's 6'11, which no other ""guard"" is.    Crazy that the only other guard that did that was Russell Westbrook, known for his rebounding (and who is also an awful defender. Did you watch the playoffs?)  Any kind of impact stat - DRPM, DPIPM, DRAPM - thinks he's average at best."
"No he doesn't? His DBPM is 2.6. That's not even top 20.    But even if that were true - which again, it's not - it woudnt matter, because DBPM is by far the worst and most meaningless of defensive stats.   Anyone who gets both assists and rebounds will rank as a good defender.   I mean, who could forget about the defensive prowess of Mason Plumlee, Nikola Jokic, and Russell Westbrook, 3 of your top 7 defensive players in the league."

"It’s upvoted because Westbrook is bad. That’s pretty much all it boils down to. And you can’t look before his MVP season because KD was the reason for all prior success. Speaking of his MVP season, that’s pretty much invalid too.  Life is much better when you stop reading these idiots’ takes, realize Westbrook is a Hall of Fame lock and mostly celebrated in the league as a high caliber player.  Sure, Russell Westbrook doesn’t equate to “winning basketball”. At the end of the season, only one team gets that distinction. And it sure as fuck isn’t the team this Jazz fan is rooting for."
"Ok, who in the league **now** is stopping Russell Westbrook?  Terrible argument, GTFO."
Bro...you think Stockton is stopping Russell Westbrook??? Get the fuck out of here. Stockton would take charges and that's about it. Damn sure not locking that man down.
"Lol it's a fucking discussion forum you Westbrook stan.   If you actually bothered to read, I said I would say Westbrook has the better career but you are too busy blindly defending Russell it's crazy.  I am admittedly not a fan of Westbrook but I can't deny how good he still is. Same goes for CP3, if you actually see my comments about him, I think he's probably the biggest bitch in the league, but doesn't change the fact he's still easily a top 10 PG of all time.  Just because I don't think Westbrook ""easily"" has the best career, I'm trolling LOL. Good logic there."

"Russell Westbrook. You are already starting to see it, some thread earlier today saying his 20-20-20 game wasn't that impressive."
I’m picturing him throwing leeches into the fire.  “The usurper Russell Westbrook”  “The usurper Kevin Durant”  “The usurper James Harden”
James Harden &gt; Stephen Curry  James Harden performed the best against Golden State than any other player this postseason.   Russell Westbrook is good at basketball
"Your downvotes don't change reality. Your state is full of conservative white people whose parents grew up in a church where black people people were treated as subhuman, and they haven't stopped voting for Mitt Romney and Donald Trump, and they still do everything they can to teach their kids to be just like them. Republicans still dominate almost every election in the state, and still win most of the elections in Salt Lake City, the ""liberal haven."" And my racist white acquaintances in Salt Lake City still hate Russell Westbrook, and are still genuinely upset about that bigot getting fired from the car dealership."
"Good post.  Another interesting wrinkle is the relationship between USG% and AST%. Because AST% is just the ratio of assists generated by a player to the total assists generated by the team, high usage guards (like Russell Westbrook) tend to have high AST%, even when they're not elite distributors. (Of course, elite distributors do also tend to have AST%, so it's not the worst stat, just prone to error in this specific way.)  In general, a lot of the stats on BK-Ref, which I adore and have been using for a decade now, have been somewhat eclipsed by better versions. Passer Rating and Offensive Load are good substitutes for AST% and USG%."
Russell Westbrook...
Yeah but if your a fan of a team do you want them too let Russell Westbrook walk? Bc I sure as fuck wouldn’t lol suffer through a couple years of Elfrid Payton and lemme know your thoughts
Russell Westbrook
"I know some SLC residents who are Jazz fans, and the only social media posts they ever make about basketball are about what a nice young man Ricky Rubio is and what a disgrace to his race Russell Westbrook is. They really really hate Russell Westbrook. And black people.

Russell Westbrook is more intimidating than all of today's WWE superstars.
"Tbf I don’t think Westbrook has that many haters compared to Curry, LeBron and KD it’s just that the people that hate Russell Westbrook REALLY hate Russell Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook gotta be in here somewhere.
"You are correct! I just started making a list, got 10 guards deep and figured I had made my point.   Steph, Harden, Dame, Kyrie, Kemba, Westbrook, Beal, Klay, McCollum, Booker, CP3, Fox, Lou Williams, Lavine, Dragic, Russell, Lowry, Oladipo (healthy), Dinwiddie, Harris, Murray  There’s 20. I could probably come up with more. But I took the all NBA guards, then the snubs, then just thought off the top of my head by team."

"FWIW, here's who he voted for second team all-nba: Leonard, Kawhi (TOR); Durant, Kevin (GSW); Embiid, Joel (PHI); Lillard, Damian (POR); and Westbrook, Russell (OKC  Link to the All-Defensive team: https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/2018-19-NBA-All-Defensive-Team-Voter-Selections-1.pdf"
Even Russell Westbrook is better than Oscar Robertson from an all-time standpoint.
"To me, the one play that defined what a ""Russell Westbrook"" is was the almost dunk he had over Andrew Bynum. That is Westbrook in a nutshell: Slowly jogs up the court, waves a player to the left, and then out of nowhere he explodes to the hole without any thought about consequences (worrying about that later), looking to conquer that mountain in front of him, it doesn't happen, but damn are you glad to have witnessed what almost could have been. Westbrook has all this intensity, all this emotion, all this talent. You can see him in flashes as being all world with his skills but he can never quite reach over that mountain and slam that damned ball in to that rim (metaphorical). Maybe he might be able to in HOU. He might finally get engaged and learn to use all his talents and abilities to help Harden when that ring (ala Fraizer and Monroe with the Knicks)"
"&gt;We recently had conversations with Russell about the team, his career, and how and how he see the future. Through those conversations we came to the understanding that looking at some alternative situations would be something that made sense for him. As a result, and due to his history with the Thunder we worked together to accommodate this. Our ability to have these types of conversations and work so closely with Russell and his agent Thad Foucher is only possible because of the depth of the relationship that has been built over the last 11 years.    &gt;Russell Westbrook is the most important player in the brief history of the Oklahoma City Thunder. He has left an incredible mark on this team, city and state. None of us could have anticipated the player he has become, and we are all deeply proud of what he has contributed to the success of the franchise and to our community. Russell and his wife Nine, their three children, his brother and his parents will always remain part of the Thunder family. We wish them nothing but happiness and success in the future."
Those are some Russell Westbrook numbers
"This is the game. This is the one that made Russell Westbrook my favorite player. I was watching it when I was in high school, it was my first year watching the NBA I didn’t have a favorite team or player, until this game. I loved watching him just shoot his shot no matter what, I had a bunch of friends I was watching with say stuff like “he needs to stop shooting he’s taking away shots that KD could take” and I just thought who cares he is giving he thunder life. I just loved that Westbrook himself didn’t care about the outside criticism and just kept playing his game and kept trying."
"TLDR a bunch of kids whinging yet again that Russell Westbrook is being praised for the star that he is, the way they moan about him you'd think he fucked their mother and didn't call her back."
"I think you are taking this sub way too seriously.  People like to argue about sports, so people on here argue about sports.  If you and others want to pretend there is some sort of “mental illness/depression” epidemic on here simply because people aren’t praising Russell Westbrook enough, fine, but it seems a bit silly"

Russell  Westbrook is that Dude and can’t never caught a break with Media at all give his all every game like chuck said so sad ppl.
30/10/10/10 turnovers  Russell Westbrook
"As a person, I love Russell Westbrook. Like KD said during his MVP speech. Russ will run straight through walls if it means he can help his teammates, family, friends etc. The fire he brings to the game is unmatched imo. And he’s been one of the realest people in the nba.   That being said, when you look at him from a basketball perspective. Russ is a one of a kind talent, but with his passion, comes stubbornness. And he’s shown so many times that he isn’t willing to change how he plays to benefit the team. He’s going to struggle with harden because he doesn’t have a consistent jumper and isn’t a great off ball player in general.  The triple doubles are great and all, but a lot of people will see him as a top 10 player if he increased his %’s and lowered his turnovers. Hell even if Westbrook averaged 22/7/7 next season but has 50% fg/ 38% 3pt/ and 85% ft with 3 TO’s a game. A lot of people will value Westbrook so much more with that stat line."
"I mean on those KD/Russ teams, KD wasn’t really. *that guy* until maybe the last 18 months? He might have been #2, but it was farrr away from Lebrons #1.   I know this sub loves to frame it in what it would be like for Russell Westbrook *today* to not defer to KD *today*,but back then their stock was much closer. KD hadn’t fully matured, Russ hadn’t had his knee gunned at by Patrick Beverly, and they were a very close 1-1a pairing.   Also I know it sounds crazy now, but Russ in his earlier years hit a ton of game winners in his earlier years.  [here’s](https://youtu.be/6w0NPl-VmSQ) a few clips. This is a guy who has these plays running in the back of his mind in clutch situations. And for a time, KD has a reputation for not being Clutch. So it not crazy He felt he was deserving of the last shot as much as anyone else. These were guys who came up together. Had the same amount of All-Stars. Same amount of accolades, awards, and accomplishments when they played together.   So you can look back at it now and think “who’s 3 time first-round exist Russell Brickbrook to take shots over 2x FMVP KD?” But at the time it really was just Russ and Kevin, and that was their dynamic."
1. Blake Griffin  2. Russell Westbrook  3. Bradley Beal  4. Klay Thompson  5. Jimmy Butler  6. Kemba Walker  7. Victor Oladipo  8. Jrue Holiday  9. Ben Simmons  10. Pascal Siakam  11. Nikola Vucevic
"To be honest, I think a lot of the time when someone says something to the extent of 'I don't like Russel Westbrooks game' what they really mean is 'I don't like Russell Westbrook'. There are definitely plenty of ways to criticize Russ the player but I genuinely think his demeanor and attitude or whatever else make people just not rush him so no matter what he does they want to criticize him."
Russell Westbrook looks like the most annoying person to guard
Literally EVERYTHING Russell Westbrook does on the floor is selfish?! Are you Skip Bayless?!
"Notable exceptions:  Ben Wallace, Bill Laimbeer, Anthony Mason, Karl Malone, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Demar DeRozan"
Russell Westbrook is a wildly inefficient shooter.  News at 11.
"Tracy McGrady, Paul George (so far), Russell Westbrook (so far), James Harden (so far), and although unlikely, if he does make the hall of fame, Derrick Rose (so far)."
"That's a good point. Westbrook is probably more explosive then anyone else in the league when he gets a ""head of steam"" but there he does a lot of standing around as well. But for example Steph Curry moves around on offense a TON more than Russell does."
"This is a very stupid question   Disregarding the fact that Russell Westbrook absolutely is a team player; You can be selfish and still want to win. There are tons of guys in pickup who hate losing and so they start chucking because they think they’re the team’s best option. I’m sure it happens in the NBA too. It’s not that they don’t want to win, it’s that they believe they are the only ones who can will the team to a win"
Imagine gnuinely thinking Russell Westbrook doesnt want to win a championship enough to play hard the finals.
"Wall's value will never be as low as it is right now. People assume he'll be coming back next year and need a walker. Will he still have that extra  gear that  made him faster than every non-Russell Westbrook player? Probably not. But Wall at 75% his old speed is still an above average PG. So his contract may be an albatross, but not one worth giving multiple picks to get rid of."
"This, also if we adjust raw stats for pace of play, Melo averages way more pts, just as many rebounds, and almost as many assists. Plus PG was getting more open looks since he was playing alongside Russell Westbrook, meanwhile the best teammates Melo had in 2013 were a washed up Amar'e, JR, and Tyson Chandler. Still led that team to 5 more wins in the regular season and deeper into the playoffs as well than PG did this past year"
"His chance of getting in the 1st or 2nd team seems slim without improvement, I think Irving/Curry/Harden/Lillard are likely to hold it down. Kemba and Westbrook were 3rd team this year and that doesn’t seem locked in. Oladipo doesn’t sound like he’s going to be back for the start of the season. Who else is in the conversation?  Beal? Trae Young, Doncic, Mitchell, Fox, D’Angelo Russell? Some good players but Simmons could walk into the 3rd team if nobody else goes off."
"Here is a list of potential free agents (some have player options but most of them are likely to decline the option in favor of a longer term deal barring injury, and as Durant just showed, may not even then)  * Lebron James  * Kawhi Leonard  * Giannis Antetokounmpo  * Blake Griffin  * Paul George  * Rudy Gobert (may get extended)  * Bradley Beal (may get extended though it looks less likely right now)  * Victor Oladipo  The above are kind of cornerstone players, potential All-NBA players. Lebron and Blake will be older, but both will still probably command multi-year maxes at that stage (though some team may end up regretting it ala Chris Paul).   There are ""second tier"" players though that in any other year would probably be headliners (like when Gordon Hayward got a max contract)  * Jrue Holiday  * DeMar Derozan  * CJ McCollum  Andre Drummond will be a free agent. Otto Porter Jr. will be a free agent. Other interesting players like Justise Winslow, Josh Richardson, Jerami Grant (though I think he can opt out in 2020 and should, he'll get a massive deal then), these guys would be in line for $60 to $80 million dollar deals this year but aren't even in the top 12 for 2021?  And we haven't even touched on the older player market (Mike Conley, LaMarcus Aldridge),  as well as what would normally be the mid-tier but will be scrounging for MLE's (Joe Ingles, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose who will only be 32 years old remarkably by then, Will Barton, Kelly Oubre Jr, etc).  Lonzo Ball will be a RFA. So will Jayson Tatum, De'Aaron Fox, Jonathon Isaac, Lauri Markkanen, Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen, etc (what a good draft year btw). And while the RFA market is normally dead (like Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum won't really be available), there will be a lot of teams with cap space to be disruptive.  Speaking of that cap space, did you notice how many two year contracts were tossed around this year? This is why. It's also why Chris Paul's contract is untradeable. He has a $40 million dollar player option for 2021 that at age 36 he's surely going to exercise. Right as the largest Free Agent bonanza ever hits.   What we saw this year wasn't just free agency movement. Going in you had Durant, Irving, Thompson, Butler, Walker, Russell, and Leonard as your franchise altering players. Than you had the second tier (Middleton, Harris, Horford, etc). The reason this year got wild was the gyrations teams went through to accommodate two of those franchise altering players (Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler). That created a ripple effect that impacted OKC which is still rippling.   With more top tier players moving in 2021, you should probably expect more big trades as teams try to assemble rosters around them to entice those players. So players we aren't even expecting to be impacted, like Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul were this year, will end up in play in 2021 in addition to that ridiculous roster posted above.   We also don't yet know who the inevitable ""disgruntled stars"" will be like Anthony Davis. Again, Davis forced his way out to play with Lebron. It'll be no different in 2021. Does Devin Booker force his way out? Karl Anthony Towns? (not making predictions Suns/Wolves fans, strictly using those guys as examples, no offense intended).    When you look at the cap space, it's obvious other NBA teams see the same thing. Only the 76ers and GSW are guaranteed to be completely capped out in 2021, and GS in particular has shown that that won't necessarily stop them from being able to make moves (the same is likely true for the 76ers). The Nuggets, Rockets, and Nets are already pretty close, but the entire rest of the NBA (25 teams) can plausibly enter 2021 with max free agent space (or more) with minimal effort.  NBA teams are being hyper protective of their 2021 cap sheet for a reason."
"Russell Westbrook would have died in his Thunder uniform if they didn't trade Paul George for 8 draft picks.   OKC decided to blow it all up, PG wanted to leave for a better chance at a ring. It's sad, even with Dirk, we didn't blow it up until after he won, but we were in 5-8 limbo for years until we finally broke through and everything clicked."
"Don't have the DRPM stats, but: https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/xs-and-os-damian-lillards-defense-russell-westbrook  He was doing anything like this in the previous years."
"I agree with your starters and would add:   1. Russell Westbrook 1. Blake Griffin 1. Chris Bosh 1. Paul George 1. Dwight Howard 1. Klay Thompson 1. Derrick Rose 1. Carmelo Anthony 1. Chris Paul 1. Paul George  I think Giannis and Jokic's success hasn't been long enough within this decade, they'd probably slate into 2020s decade team though.  Apologies to Damian Lillard, LaMarcus, Kyrie, Al Horford, Wade, and a bunch of other players I'm forgetting."
"1. Saw Russell Westbrook at UCLA summer of 2014. Before I knew what was happening, my body was running toward him screaming ""RUUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSS..."" He was hella cool about it tho and gave me a fist bump. Nice guy all around. 2. Went to a Clippers game in 2017 and sat pretty close to courtside. This was Paul Pierce's last season and he was riding the bench the whole night so I was just shouting ""Paul Pierce!"" repeatedly trying to get his attention. Finally he looked at me but I didn't think that far ahead, so I continued to shout his own name to his face over and over. He shook his head at me in disappointment and confusion but also a hint of amusement. It was a beautiful moment. 3. Was super high at Disneyland last summer and saw Trevor Ariza and my friend and I turned to each other and said ""hey that's Trevor Ariza."""
TIL Russell Westbrook has never made it past the 1st round.
Imagine trading for Russell Westbrook
"FWIW, it may not too:  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rockets-harden-fit-morey-ball-shooting-passing-video-analysis/4/  &gt;Westbrook didn’t just lead the NBA in assists (10.7) by a wide margin (Kyle Lowry was second with 8.7), he led the NBA in the right kinds of assists. Via PBPStats, nobody assisted on more shots at the rim (358) than Westbrook. Only Trae Young assisted on more corner threes (104) than Westbrook did (98). Westbrook’s 456 Moreyball assists (rim + corner three assists) led the NBA, with Young (440) and Harden (419) in the rearview mirror.    And on a team with fewer 3 point shooters."
"Cap space is valuable in two ways. For contenders or teams trying to be contenders, it is valuable because you can add quality outside pieces to improve your team. The Thunder, already not having cap space and being bad after trading PG13, do not need cap space for this purpose. The ONLY other purpose of cap space is that you can help other teams make moves involving bad salaries that those other teams took on by swallowing these salaries in exchange for picks. It doesn't matter to OKC who is on the roster with these picks; it could be Russell Westbrook or Chris Paul or James Harden or Pau Gasol or old ass Michael Jordan. All they care about is the picks, which they got. But CP3 himself is not a negative asset to OKC, just as James Harden wouldn't be. CP3 was a negative asset to Houston though, which is why the Thunder got picks attatched in the first place. Value is not concrete; it is relative. That seems to be what you don't understand"
Russell Westbrook looks funny on that list
 There's nothing wrong with OKC.    The biggest issue is they stole some else's team right when they drafted Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.   And then all the Oklahoma City fans claimed them like they were their own instead of accepting that they were the bandwagon fans that they were.   And then OKC Thunder never won anything and now the team is blown up and they're in the tank.   This is what happens when you steal someone else's team.
Russell Westbrook 2019-2020.
"he said ""we're excited to have Russell Westbrook etc etc.""  he was fined because the trade hadn't gone through yet so technically Westbrook was still on the Thunder."
No no it's defensive juggernaut Russell Westbrook
I agree.  I feel weird for being a lot more upset about the current situation than a lot of my fellow Thunder fans are.  We just lost Russell Westbrook and Paul George in the space of a week.  The chances of us drafting a couple guys on that level with our war chest of first-round picks is very low.  Yet we're hearing all about how this actually needed to happen and the future is bright.  I'm not sold.
"Russell Westbrook should get a ""Trading Places"" colorway. Chris Paul can wear the boxes."

Russell Westbrook ? 🤷🏽‍♂️
"I don't think anyone in the Oklahoma front office sincerely believed he wasn't in line for regression. For a player in that position, especially when a guy has a background with that fan base the way Russell Westbrook does, there really isn't any choice you just have to pay the man. Not only would you royally piss off your fan base, but you'd also be sending the message to the entire NBA that this is a team who isn't willing to reward you, even if you carry the franchise on your back for long stretches of time."
"The name Trae Young came to you and not Russell Westbrook. I think that says a lot about your basketball IQ. I think this says a lot about your general intelligence:  &gt;I would probably have him 7 or 8?   Yet now you say:  &gt;It is just a bunch of PGs to evaluate how realistic ""out of the top 10 is.  Is he in the top 10 or not? Because, I'm not sure you're aware, 7 or 8 is in the top 10.  It also says a lot if you believe that Simmons could potentially be behind Trae Young. Or that Chris Paul, at 34 and with a far more onerous contract, is ahead of Simmons. Or that Harden and Paul, who were on the same team and both started, were somehow both point guards."
Russell Westbrook. Multiple conference finals. Finals appearance. Awful shooter. John Wall. Multiple conference finals appearances as a pretty poor 3 point shooter. Mario Chalmers on those Heatles teams. I’ll agree that a team needs *shooting* to be competitive. But it doesn’t have to come from the PG. There’s more than 1 way to skim a cat.
lol so you list Trae Young before Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook is a Houston Rocket
"""They took Paul George, they took Russell Westbrook, and now everyone keeps asking me if I'm tanking. Y'know what? I'm thinking yeah! I'm thinking I'm tanking!"""
"Doesn’t matter. How likely do you think it is that they’ll draft 3 more MVP players? Organizations get lucky if they draft a single MVP caliber player within a decade, let alone 3 former MVP’s, only to lose them all.  OKC can rebuild all that they want, they’ll never match Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden."
"I mean he shouldn’t have outlasted Paul George, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook."
I like how this is posted on the same day as the Russell Westbrook learning the Harden stepback video
That's actually a tiny hitch in this video. I think Russell Westbrook has more of a hitch with his shot.   Ray Allen and Reggie Miller both had hitches and they were elite shooters.
"James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Giannis, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving"
You *really* think Bill fucking Russell doesn't get a max?    Gobert shut down the reigning MVP in Westbrook the series before that. Offense players can get shut down too. Guess they don't deserve max money.  Think about what you're actually saying.
https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/12/russell-westbrook-reportedly-wanted-a-trade-before-paul-george/
"I don't see ""Russell Westbrook seems to be approving"". Do you work for ESPN? Are the ESPN alts helping you get upvotes?"
"&gt; in the postseason gobert has been pretty much useless   Lol, the fuck?  He had a bad series against Houston 2 years back, but wasn't bad once Snyder adapted the defense scheme in game 3 last season.  He also completely dad dicked Russell Westbrook.  Hell, the season we lost to the Warriors he'd literally just come back from an injury suffered in the first round and shouldn't have been playing.    He struggles against teams that are elite in the midrange.  Rockets exchanging CP3 (who is a god there) for Russ (who, as we have discussed, Gobert has dad dicked) makes them 100% an easier matchup for Utah.  Lakers and Clippers literally haven't played games w/ their current rosters, and frankly there isn't really much reason Gobert's game won't work against those two.    Learn how basketball works nephew.    &gt;And conley is not better than mitchell.  He was last season tbh.  Mitchell had a bad first half of the season."
"Pg: Russell westbrook Sg: James harden  Sf: Carmelo  Pf; Paul George  C: Kevin Durant   The thunder would have the ultimate small ball lineup, imo this team is straight unguardable, and it would work because they all were in their primes at one point with each other."
If mike Tyson played basketball he would be Russell Westbrook
How has George had a better peak?  PG has been nba 1st team once compared to 3 times for pippen  &amp;#x200B;  pippen won 55 games when his 2nd best player was horace grant  PG won 49 next to russell westbrook.
What do the Hornets have to do Russell Westbrook?
"he was, I don't hate the pick, but I definitely think Rose was chosen because of a narrative rather than any objective measurement.  Objectively LeBron would have been MVP for 8 straight years, easy, but storylines take over and Russell Westbrook gets one because he gets lots of stats.   Rose was amazing that year, though."
"Ben Simmons is 23 and has exponentially more value than Russell Westbrook. I'm also not arguing that he's in the top 20 basketball players.   As for the second half of your comment, it's just an example, an actual statistic -- something you're yet to provide -- to back up my argument."
Russell Westbrook played basketball in college  Russell Westbrook was childhood friends with Clayton Kershaw and Matt Stafford. I know all your cliches
You never answered my question.   How many away games in the playoffs has Russell Westbrook won since Durant left?  I just want to add context to your point about all these intangibles he provides.
imho he is the best player in the NBA from houston with name russell westbrook
Russell Westbrook has added 12 pounds of muscle and is in the best shape of his life
Kobe was with the Lakers longer &amp; did more for them.  It's like saying Russell Westbrook is the greatest OKC/SEA player over KD and Gary Payton.
In other words you've got nothing so you're going resort to name calling because you're defensive analytics argument didn't hold up.  According to defensive win shares and defensive rating Russell Westbrook and Brook Lopez are top 10 defenders.  Tell me what statistics you believe more accurately rates defenders and I'll happily look into them but i think we'd both agree Westbrook and Brook Lopez are not top 10 defenders even if defensive analytics says they are.
"&gt;according to defensive rating and defensive win shares both Russell Westbrook and Brook Lopez are top 10 defenders  If you actually think this is what makes up analytic opinion, you are an idiot who has no right to comment on analytics at all. Seriously, you are an idiot. One thing, used completely incorrectly, does not make up analytics. If you are actually this ignorant on analytics, you should succumb to your eye test, which is actually just group think mixed with your personal bias."

According to defensive win shares and defensive rating Russell Westbrook and Brook Lopez are top 10 defenders.  I don't really need anything else to prove how flawed defensive analytics are. Have a nice day
No my comment is not false according to defensive rating and defensive win shares both Russell Westbrook and Brook Lopez are top 10 defenders
I think “Russell Westbrook trade” is probably worse for them
According to your analytics Russell Westbrook and Brook Lopez are both top 10 defenders last season and Mason Plumlee Javale McGhee are better defenders than Kawhi.  Do you honestly think that is more accurate than your own eye test?
For example according to Defensive analytics Russell Westbrook was the 7th best defender in the league last year.  And you're argument is that is more accurate than the eye test?  Lol
"Jimmy Butler over Russell Westbrook... Zion top-20...  Somebody, please, delete this."
"There have been 39 LeBron games in NBA history. Most recently done by Bradley Beal this past season. Only 4 players, Jerry West, Jo Jo White, Grant Hill, and Russell Westbrook have multiple LeBron statline games."
"A.) I'm not suggesting this deal happens this second per se, tho thatd be nice. You wait until all the FA signings can be part of a deal, making things much more flexible. I dont think your point about the one year rental holds much water considering we are in this era of ""get the star in now for the run, worry about the re-signing later"", and Bob Myers is fairly good at his job. Hes not gonna shoehorn a trade where its a bad fit, draymond will never consider re-signing there, and he gets a poor return because of it.  But most importantly, the Russell move is the backdrop for this. In the same way that Presti wasnt quite as cut throat about a Westbrook return, I could see Myers ensuring he gets two of the big three asset boxes checked, cos he either knows hes got something cooking with Russell or he has already made the Russell trade and the draymond move would be secondary.  &gt;Now you're looking at a $14M-$15M player plus a young guy and a first rounder.   So as far as the return, we can ammend this to say we are looking for 14-15m in matching salary, not in a single player per se, and perhaps not even for sure an expiring. Depending on what the DLo return looks like, the dubs could be in position to take on bad salary through the 2020 season, so long as the books are clean for 2021, and the asset warchest is fat.  Id also say i dont need a young player back, and would prefer just more draft capital.    You stretch this out in terms of a medium term view for the warriors, where 2021 is the goal, then all sorts of shit becomes possible. I think people are being way too reductive and short term in their ideas on what a green deal would look like overall."
"There have been 519 triple doubles from 2014-2019, totalling five seasons.  Russell Westbrook accounts for 136.  James Harden accounts for 43.   34% of all triple doubles in the last five years have come from players who are now on the Houston Rockets.  This is assuming that no one else on the Rockets has a triple double I that time, but I can't find an updated roster so it'll have to do."
Paul George averaged a career high in points and rebounds and due to Russell Westbrook’s playmaking. Russ is not selfish because he deferred all season to Paul George and help him in his MVP run.  Like I said Ben Simmons can benefit from taking a back seat because he had Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid to take over. Who else other than Paul George can Westbrook rely on to run the Thunder’s offense?  Shoot if the roles were swapped and Russ played as starting point guard on the Sixers with that roster the Sixers would probably make the playoffs
"It’s not the fact that Russell is a bad shooter, you can work around that? It’s his shot selection that’s the problem. Simmons doesn’t take the bad shots Westbrook does."
Put Ben Simmons on OKC next to Andre Roberson and Steven Adams. And even if he has Paul George with the same scenario of being injured after the all star break does he make the playoffs in the wild wild west?  Ben Simmons benefits from a stacked roster. Russell Westbrook is being criticized due to a NON SPACING poo poo roster. And Russ still average a a 3rd consecutive triple double.  So yeah you right. There is no comparison
He dunks a ton for a guard.  Gets dunks more often than Russell Westbrook ever did.
"Ok sure, this Rockets team with James Harden a top 5 player in the league is gonna be a shitshow because we added Russell Westbrook a former MVP that used to go to the finals and WCF frequently when he played with Durant and was the second best player on the team but the Sixers are gonna be hot shit because Tobias Harris is their best shooter. You can save this comment when Giannis runs a train on the Sixers in the playoffs."
"Put Russell Westbrook on any team and you already know him leading a team will equate to nothing in the playoffs.   Bro, he literally can't even win an away game with his play style. You guys are going to be a complete shit show next season. I know you don't want to hear it, but just save this and come back to me in January.   With an established team I think Tobias makes more sense."
You’d really take Tobias Harris over Russell Westbrook in a playoff series? Switch Tobias and Russ in 90% of team situations and their playoff chances crater.

Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook.
Basically Russell Westbrook.
Jimmer should have been selected before Kyrie (this was in 2011).   Kawhi is a system player and won't have as much success after he leaves the Spurs.   Lakers will win the championship and the rest of the leauge doesn't have a chance after they got Steve Nash and Dwight Howard.   Russell Westbrook is better than Steph Curry.
"&gt;BEsT eFfiCeNcY... 99% of points are next to basket.  And?  Do dunks not count as points anymore?  Being good on offense =/= being able to create your own shot.  Gobert is one of the best screeners in the league and an absolutely elite roll man.  Gobert rolling to the basket for a dunk was literally the most efficient play in the NBA in last season.  How on Earth does that somehow not count in your head?    &gt;He is a French DeAndre Jordan who can block + rebound   LOL, he's better than DJ ever was on offense, and is obviously worlds better as a defender.    &gt;Nobody is scared of the oaf.  He completely fucked Russell Westbrook, the reigning MVP, two seasons ago.  You quite simply do not know what you are talking about."
"I sincerely do not know. I love Russell Westbrook, and I'm not sure about the fit. Him and Harden are both so high usage it's tough, and while I think the pendulum has swung too far towards Russ criticism, I also can't deny that he often hurt the Thunder late in close games the last few seasons, and has laid consecutive eggs in the playoffs. I think there's reason for optimism- his catch and shoot numbers are historically much better than his off the dribble shooting (not great, but much better), the amount of space that being surrounded by shooters will create will put him in a position to have incredible driving lanes, and he shot a very strong percentage at the rim on high volume with little floor spacing last season. Russ has all the tools of a player who can be great off the ball, and if he's willing to make an effort to score off cuts and cut down on his long 2s, I think there's a strong chance that things work out. But even as a huge Russ fan, I have to admit I don't know if he's gonna do that"
Russell Westbrook didn’t deserve to win an MVP
They both have good arguments for WOAT snake.   KD played poorly which contributed to his team blowing a 3-1 lead then he joined the team that beat him a month later. Reportedly didn’t even have the spine to tell his teammates and he also disrespected them on burner accounts   PG said he had “unfinished business” with Russell Westbrook immediately after signing a max contract with the Thunder. He demanded a trade a year later into his 3+1 max contract because Kawhi asked him if he wanted to team up. PG also demanded a trade out of Indiana while he was still under contract. So he effectively weaseled his way out of 2 commitments
Russell Westbrook is a stat padder. His numbers are crazy and only after he retires and some time passes will we understand just how crazy they were but that is all about him and his game. I really hope something works out with him at the Rockets but otherwise he just doesn't seem interested about winning to me.
"Id say russell westbrook and a weaker messi are a good link, both cover all basis' of offense fantastically, they are both the cores of their team too, main problen is messi is alot better at playmaking and is alot less selfish"
"I don’t even focus energy on KD anymore, I just support this team and Russell Westbrook (don’t have a problem with PG also)"
"If you want to have Harden over Kawhi, fine...but Russell Westbrook over Kawhi Leonard is straight criminal."
Kawhi Leonard over Russell Westbrook
"Harden just flopped hard saying “we love China”, so no.  https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/we-love-china-rockets-harden-sorry-over-gms-hong-kong-tweet-doc-1l70ld6  *Harden distanced himself from the controversy.*  *""We apologise.

"&gt;""We apologise. We love China,"" he said, standing alongside fellow Rockets guard Russell Westbrook. ""We love playing there. Both of us, we go there once or twice a year. They show us most support so we appreciate them.""  If this is what he really said, then that is crossing a line from what Morey or the NBA has said. That's going too far in terms of ""apologizing"". It's one thing to acknowledge the controversy a comment has stirred and expressing regret over that controversy. It's a completely different to unconditionally apologize for it.  Someone from the organization or from all teams needs to immediately release a memo to all players that they should defer any questions regarding this topic to a later time/date. These kind of impromptu interviews make the player look really bad and ergo the organization as well. Someone at the Rockets needs to pull their head out of their ass and communicate the issue to all its players."
"well Morey may not have *technically* apologized for it but... Harden just did.  &gt; ""We apologise. We love China,"" he said, standing alongside fellow Rockets guard Russell Westbrook."
"By Natsuko Fukue, Agence France-Presse  Houston Rockets star James Harden on Monday apologised to China over a tweet by the team's general manager backing Hong Kong's democracy protests that cost the franchise TV exposure and sponsorship in the lucrative Chinese market.  The team and the NBA were forced into defensive mode as China's state broadcaster said it was yanking Rockets games from the air and sponsors abandoned them.  The controversy quickly spread across the Pacific, as commentators and even a presidential candidate rounded on the league for kowtowing to authoritarian Beijing.  In Tokyo, where the team is playing two exhibition matches this week, Harden distanced himself from the controversy.  ""We apologise. We love China,"" he said, standing alongside fellow Rockets guard Russell Westbrook. ""We love playing there. Both of us, we go there once or twice a year. They show us most support so we appreciate them.""  The furor comes after general manager Daryl Morey -- whose Rockets have had a huge following in China since they signed Yao Ming in 2002 -- posted a tweet Friday featuring the message ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong"".  On Monday he tried to calm the water. ""I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,"" he tweeted.  ""I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.""  ""I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,"" he added.  - 'Get out of China' -  Semi-autonomous Hong Kong has been battered by four months of increasingly violent pro-democracy protests.  The rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, fuelling fears of an erosion of liberties in Hong Kong under the 50-year ""one country, two systems"" model China agreed before the 1997 handover from Britain.  The NBA issued its own statement, saying it recognised Morey's views ""have offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable."" ""While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals' educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them,"" the statement issued by chief communications officer Mike Bass said.  But a Chinese-language version of the statement posted on Weibo went further, saying the NBA was ""deeply disappointed by the inappropriate remarks"". In the United States, the NBA found itself under fire for its apology, which presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, a Texan, called ""an embarrassment.""  ""The only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights,"" he tweeted.  The NBA's statement also did little to mollify fans in China, with furious comments among the 15,000 responses on Weibo.  ""This is an apology?"" one user wrote. ""Get out of China,"" added another.  - 'Incorrect comments' -  The Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets are due to play pre-season games in Shanghai and Shenzhen later this week.  Chinese state broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, have both said they will halt Rockets broadcasts.  And sponsors including sportswear brand Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank announced they were cutting ties.  The moves came after the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) said it would sever ties with the Rockets over Morey's ""incorrect comments"".  The Rockets had already tried to distance themselves from the controversy, with owner Tilman Fertitta on Friday writing on Twitter that Morey ""does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets... we are NOT a political organization.""  The Rockets are in Japan for two exhibition games and Harden said Monday that remained the team's focus.  ""The reason why we're here in Japan is we got two amazing games tomorrow and Thursday,"" he told reporters.  ""(It's) an opportunity for fans to come and watch NBA... we're excited to be here."""
"Yeah, and Russell Westbrook with his sub .500ts% and non-existent defense isn't on decline, give me a break."
"I feel like Rondo gets by too much on name recognition alone. 47% TS last year is absolutely atrocious, significantly worse than even Russell westbrook who is considered very inefficient. If any other player put that garbage on the court they'd be having to fight for any minutes at all but Rondo still gets to play."
Why does kyrie Irving look so damn short? I know he’s really tall for the general population but he looks like an average human being on the court.   Meanwhile steph curry and Russell Westbrook who are the same height look way bigger? Kyrie isn’t thicc or anything so am I tripping?
"So, I guess with his MVP AND Finals appearance Russell Westbrook is the best player in the league."
". . .and Rick Barry, Wilt, John Havlicek, Jerry West, Sam Jones, Sleepy Floyd, Ray Allen, Russell Westbrook, Bob Cousy, Bob Petit, Billy Cunningham, Bob McAdoo, Dominique Wilkins, Karl Malone, Vince Carter, Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant  I'd say that's quite a ""few"""
"Bad shooting mechanics. You don't want a hitch in your shot. Makes your shot easier to contest, slower, it messes up your rhythm, and lowers your shooting arc past 12-15 feet.  It's also a two-motion shot, which usually, you might've guessed it, you don't want. Two motion shots require you to jump higher, lowering your arc, and also to release at the top of your jump, making the ball more rigid on release. Notable two motion shooters, Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook, Ray Allen, prime Derrick Rose, Dirk Nowitzki, Ben Simmons, and of course most bad shooters in general.  Two-Motion shots can work, but it takes longer to become proficient at them, along with the other negatives I listed. There's a reason almost nobody shoots like that, it's bad mechanics. Youth Basketball players are taught how to shoot properly now, you don't get many Ben Simmons looking jumpers making the NBA anymore."
"You should go by the footage, nba analysts get things wrong all the time genius. We live in a world where Russell Westbrook got the MVP over Kawhi Leonard, are you willing to say he’s a better player just because that what the NBA said?   CP3 got all defensive first team over Roberson in 2017, are you willing to say he’s a better defender?"
Russell Westbrook might be one of the most underrated players of this generation I mean he’s an all time great in my books
You and me both. I’ve lost so much karma for telling people that lillard is not 6’3” but is 6’1” and that it’s idiotic to think Russell Westbrook is 6’5” ( he’s 6’2”)...
"&gt; The raptors added kawhi to a team that won 60 games the yr before &gt;  &gt; The rockets are adding Russell Westbrook who hasn't played offball in his professional career and also doesn't play up to his level in the playoffs. Hasn't won a series since Durant left.  I mean but the Rockets are adding Westbrook to a team that won 54 games with 3/5 starters missing a combined 53 games? I don't think its as clear cut as you make it, certainly Kawhi is a much bigger upgrade from Derozan than Westbrook is from CP3 (if that is considered an upgrade, definitely some trade offs between the two). Westbrook hasn't played off ball, but he has played second fiddle. And lets not act like Westbrook is entirely to blame for not winning a series since KD left when he's had shit team construction around him and Paul George didn't show up in the playoffs the entirety of his Thunder career. Westbrook has shown up on playoffs past (just look at the post on the front page about OKC's +/- with him in the 2017 playoffs). He definitely has not shown up the last 2 years but neither has his team. The amount of success we have will certainly be dependent on how well Westbrook adapts his game, but he has not really had the chance to with how awful the team constructed around him has been the last 3-4 years. But I guess we will have to wait and see"
No. That's exactly the point I'm arguing against. You can't compare the raptors situation to the rockets situation.  Just by adding an a superstar than they have a chance the way the raptors did.   The raptors added kawhi to a team that won 60 games the yr before   The rockets are adding Russell Westbrook who hasn't played offball in his professional career and also doesn't play up to his level in the playoffs. Hasn't won a series since Durant left.  I don't believe the nuggets or jazz will perform to what I expect them to. I don't expect them to win a championship or come out the east but can I see them beating Houston? I sure can. Does it mean they will? Well that remains to be seen.   For next it's really on if capella shows up and if westrbook makes smart decision. I want to see how this ballclub handles adversity.
"The Thunder had no shooting, George was hurt, and even if fully healthy, George isn't in the same league offensively as Harden. Do people realize that Westbrook will have the ball in his hands a lot, surrounded by a rim-running big (Adams was very good in this role and Capela is quicker and more athletic), three point shooters (so the floor will be spaced for him for the first time in his career), and Harden can work as a dynamic off-ball player to get the ball from WB with the defense out of sorts?  Even with Harden handling the ball, Westbrook can catch the pass with his man sagging or scrambling, you don't think he's adept enough to take advantage of that?   The Rockets are going to be insanely [g](https://good.As)ood. As good as CP3 was even this late into his career, you're substituting someone who couldn't take his own man off the dribble for Russell fucking Westbrook. CP3s catch-and-shoot threes and mid-range game were nice, but the Rockets will adapt."
"They were -8.0 because they didn’t run an offense and it was just “the Russell Westbrook triple double show” everyone else just stood around and watched. That’s not an argument for Russ being better than Rose, it’s an argument that Russ wanted to dominate the system and that domination peaked at 40 something wins and continuous first round losses."
Houston Rockets because James Harden is my favorite player and I root for Russell Westbrook out of spite for everyone who hates him.
"This proves what Gilbert Arenas said even more. At the 4, I don’t think he’ll match the hype. At the 2/3, or becoming a ball handler et la Russell Westbrook style? Okay now we’re going somewhere."

"Gonna play devil's advocate and try to come up with a respectable offense made up of NBA players  Center - Glenn ""Big Baby"" Davis (Size, strength, and a soft touch, reliable snap)  Guard - Kendrick Perkins (Mass) Guard - Shaq (Likes to wrastle) Tackle - Larry Johnson (Mass + Agility) Tackle - Dennis Rodman (Basically played football in Detroit. He picks up new sports quick) Tight End - Lebron James (Obv) Tight End - Kawhi Leonard (Those hands will catch anything through contact. I'm running a two TE formation to punish the D if they get too blitz happy. I'm betting on smaller NFL cornerbacks having a hard time on jump balls against LBJ and Claw) Running Back - Nate Robinson (Sproles clone, played college ball) Quarterback - Allen Iverson (Won state as starting QB in high school) Wide Receiver - Russell Westbrook (Fast) Wide Receiver - Kobe Bryant (Cause that'd be fun to watch)  *assuming all at peak physical point in life   The biggest thing you have to ignore in these hypotheticals is respect. The real reason it would be a blow out either way is that the football team would full blitz every play. The basketball team would get full court pressed, ball handlers hounded, and offensive rebounds galore. No breathing room when you know your opponent lacks skill and game IQ."
"Giannis was the biggest reason we had the best defence in the league, but Bledsoe was absolutely the next best defender on that team by a comfortable margin.   Defensive win shares are an absolute trash stat, but if you’d really like to use them his DWS this year was 50% higher than than the best year of Patrick Beverley’s career. Is Russell Westbrook a significantly better defender than Beverley as well (and every other guard in the league)? Is Andre Drummond, 2018-19 DWS leader, anywhere close to the best defender in the league? Are Nikola Vucevic and Steven Adams top 10?  Didn’t know steals per game were any kind of indicator of quality defence either. Go and look at the list of SPG leaders and tell me with a straight face that isn’t basically just a list of NBA starters sorted by random. Guys above Bledsoe include Westbrook, Drummond and Mikal Bridges. Patrick Beverley averaged less than 1 SPG by the way, good for 79th in the league, just behind Nic Batum and Andrew Wiggins.  We had three starters who had exceptional defensive years. Middleton and Brogdon were fine, but nothing special. Our defence was built on Giannis helping at the rim, drop P&amp;R (which is where Bledsoe and his ridiculous ability to fight through screens came in), and strategically leaving crap shooters open from three as often as possible (eg. Rondo or Embiid). Without Bledsoe’s exceptional man defence, we can’t run that drop P&amp;R properly and Lopez would get absolutely cooked on switches."
Russell Westbrook is a Houston Rocket
“We’ll never see another Oscar” — Russell Westbrook comes into existance  “We’ll never see another Wilt” — Shaq comes into existance  “We’ll never see another Magic” — LeBron (or even Simmons maybe in a few years) comes into existance  “We’ll never see another Jordan” — Kobe Bryant comes into existance  “We’ll never see another Alexis Texas” — Kelsi Monroe comes into existance  “We’ll never see another Curry” — ‘X’ comes into existance
"&gt;Lebron is listed at 6'8"" but is actually 6'7.25""     Boy.. most of your shit in this ""LIST"".. is wrong. Stop this nonsense.  Everyone who knows LeBron personally, have always said that he's a legit 6'9 .. He was listed 6'8 when he was coming straight out of high school. Every talk show host mentions LeBron as a 6'9 bullet train. It's nothing new.   &gt;  I don't know why some of y'all think you will know more than the people who actually knows LeBron IRL, and have been with him every single day. Stop being such an ignorant moron.  &gt;  BTW, LeBron looks like the same height as AD, when they stand next to each other. Bron actually looks bigger, because of his muscular frame.   &gt;  &gt;Russel is listed at 6'3"" but is actually 6'2.25""     Another moronic horseshit. Russell Westbrook is closer to 6'5.. not the other way around. Everyone who has met Westbrook IRL, knows this very fact as well. It's also not a secret. He's nowhere near 6'3 lol Harden and Westbrook looks like the same height.   &gt;  Curry and Lillard are around 6'1-6'2 ish. Westbrook just looks huge next to them."
"Russell Westbrook, a guy who has shot below 30% from 3 in 4 of the last 5 seasons took **19 three point attempts** in Game 6. 19! This would be like if Lonzo took 19 threes in an elimination game, except Lonzo is a better shooter."
Russell Westbrook and James Harden are on the same team
Russell Westbrook (as the 1st option)

Difference between Russell Westbrook and Paul George and fuckin Steven Adams
"Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Nash, Stockton, etc all ahead of Zeke? As a Celtics fan and a big fan of Jordan, I can’t believe what I just looked at"
According to the magic fultz is playing like russell westbrook on steroids so imma go with him
"Anthony Davis has been struggling to pull a better team to the playoffs with Jrue Holiday, so I don't think so. Donovan Mitchell isn't the best player in his team by a long shot and I don't think he'd make the playoffs without Gobert so again I doubt that one. Russell just finally made the playoffs, barely, with the Nets being a deep team IN THE EAST so that's probably blatantly false.  Davis has made it in with players like Jrue, Ego, Ryno, and Tyreke Evans. Wiggins in his second year and rookie KAT had Rubio and Lavine. Then it goes Gorgui, Bazz, Tayshaun, Bjelly, and Kmart in terms of minutes. Two of those are role players and the rest are out of league now. The pels two worst players that are regularly in rotation were probably Quincy and Omer but Kmart and Tayshaun shouldn't have been on teams and Bazz probably never should've been in the nba.   The Lakers with DLo always had a deeper team than the wolves and still never made the playoffs. You could put DLo and Davis on the same team for their first two years and compare them to Wiggins and KAT and the Timberwolves duo had better stats. First year Kat was definitively better than Davis and Wiggins was better than Russell both years.  Paul George and Westbrook have struggled to do anything besides make the playoffs and they're two Superstars in their primes, so for you to say that any of the players, in their first two years, could drag those teams to the playoffs is not reasonable."

"who do you think is a better passer? outside of lebron, cp3, westbrook i dont think there are that many guys that are significantly better than him. And what makes russell more impressive in terms of vision is that hes not a great athlete to open up lanes himself, a lot of his passes are tight window accurate passes. A lot of people are gonna see what im talking about this year when he gets more national tv action on the warriors."
"Neither was Russell Westbrook this summer, but yeah, Kobe at age 17 was definitely not near his peak, nor was it in any way a given he'd turn out the way he did.  The answer to your question though is Kareem. He was a 3 time league MVP when he got traded and he won 3 more league MVPs after the trade. It's Kareem by a mile."
"GSW? Seriously? Don’t agree at all. Lost too much talent, Klay is an unknown, they have no real good depth, Russell is an unknown, and Curry is gonna face a ton of defensive attention. Who’s gonna guard AD? Lebron? I don’t think GSW has much of a shot tbh and I don’t think that’s unfair until they prove otherwise.  Feel the same with Houston, especially considering we don’t know how WB and Harden will mesh on court.  Again, who guards AD? Capela is a good rim protector but not a great one on one defender nor a great PnR defender. As much as I love Westbrook(OKC fan here) he’s very inconsistent, and we have no idea how this is gonna turn out, I don’t think it’s crazy for LAL to be favored over them by a fair bit imo."

"Cp3 and harden didn't mesh well at all. Cp3 was reduced to a spot up shooter at times. That's not what makes cp3 great. All his stats dropped playing with harden.  Remember the reason why OKC traded away harden? Because okc didn't need 2 players that overlap so much. So if it didn't work the first time it's not likely going to work again. Harden and Westbrook are both a lot better today but it's not enough a make up for missing KD. If a trio of harden Wb and KD can't win it all. I can't see just Wb and harden winning it all.  They will win some games but how much more better are they compared to the last couple years? Especially with Lakers, clippers, Denver, and Mavs all improving. Can you honestly say Wb and harden is better than LBJ and AD or PG and kwahi or even GS with curry, green, Thompson and Russell?  The move seem desperate to me, sorry"
So why did curry post the highest ORAPM of the post season then?   You’re just pissed because Houston had their shot and fucked it up. Now they replaced paul—one of the most impactful PG’s alive—with Russell Westbrook. Eat shit
"You can have all the draft picks you want, you're not getting anything close to Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook again."

The average ESPN reader knows a hell of a lot more about Russell Westbrook than they do about Luke Kennard.
I read that as Rockstar Russell Westbrook.
"I don't think you're totally wrong, but it's unfair to say that Toronto got a championship by unloading him, because : A. Kawhi is a top 1-5 player in the NBA (which means unloading nearly anyone for Kawhi is almost always a positive) B. Toronto got Gasol, and Siakam, FVV made a huge stride in their games. None happened when DeMar was around. C. Golden State was maimed beyond recognition. And DeMar is stupidly athletic IMO, he's a poor defender and is at league average efficiency, but isn't that Westbrook most of the time? (except when he turns his Defense on). DeMar did choke, I'm not even trying to argue against it, but he played commendably vs. the Nuggets this year, which shouldn't be discounted. He's also an excellent rebounder (at the guard spot) and playmaker. Even if he did choke, he did take the Nugs to 7 and took Toronto to the ECF iirc, where they took 2 games off the Cavs. DeMar is by no means a perfect player, he can't shoot a 3 to save his life, plays piss poor D unless he really tries, and is at league average efficiency. But saying that he's not a star is an insult to him, especially when the term 'star' is being used so loosely to refer to players like Booker and Russell, who I think are still not better than DeMar yet. DeMar is HARD to build around, and not a very attractive trade piece, but he's a star. Maybe ever so slightly overpaid, but a star."
... this is the damage control once he's being questioned about an anonymous warrior player saying they find Russell Westbrook easy to guard.

So Russell Westbrook.
And Russell westbrook
Yes with RoCo and Klay coming back before the playoffs they are the favorites. No Russell is a bad fit. He's a pick and roll ball handler on a team that doesnt run pick and roll. If the Warriors start playing more PnR Draymond is worse and you're taking  the ball outta Curry's hands which is dumb.     Russell has no use off ball since he's not a great shooter nor defender. When the playoffs come around and you're going up against a guard duo of Westbrook and Harden or CJ and Dame. You want to have Covington over Russell.
"DLo is an excellent playmaker, but he's not a great scorer by any standard. IIRC he was the least efficient 20 ppg scorer this season outside of Westbrook.  &gt; roco is a better defensive player, but he cant win you games alone or lead an offense and etc  Neither can Russell, who's Nets had a below average offense last season. Covington's overall game is more of a difference-maker on a good team  &gt; he is a role player assigned to do a small role and gets treated like hes some all star  Because his defense makes him a borderline all-star level player. He's the best perimeter defender in the NBA"
"No, folks just keep giving Russell Westbrook the benefit of doubt every time and he stinks it up."
More efficient Russell Westbrook
"Vince Carter, Russell Westbrook as the guards"
"I mean those who watched and knew a lot about OKC, its players, and their system knew everyone's season as a team and on an individual level was sacrificed so Westbrook could average a triple double.  They basically made everyone spot up while Russell pounded the ball for 15 seconds out of every possession. It was clear Domantis is not a spot up shooter. Taj is not a spot up shooter, he has his occasions when he can pop, but that shouldn't be his primary means of offense. Then we get to Victor, they just used him the wrong way, flat out.  It's no surprise everyone played a lot better when they left OKC."
"I'm late to reply to this but keep this in mind. Trading for Paul George alone is completely different from trading for Paul George AND Russell Westbrook. Westbrook, on his current contract, can be argued as a negative asset. Adding Westbrook in a way lessens the amount you'd have to give in a trade."
russell westbrook is going to be really good with defenses focusing on jim harden
"What's ironic to me, you're also set in your narrative...even though Westbrook's off ball movement issues have been known and discussed for many years.  Did you really cite CP3, one of the best bball IQ in basketball as an example of standing still in a highlight reel? And are we even watching the same reel? CP3 moves off the ball beautifully and gives good spacing.  You're imagining like 2 seconds of standing still waiting for a shot, no, that's fine, I literally meant standing still constantly with no thoughts about spacing, standing still right beside a teammate who has the ball instead of spacing out. Don't get me started on off screens, cuts, moving to one side of the court for teammates to go to work on the other side, clogging the lane trying to get a triple-double instead of pulling his man away and allowing Steve Adams to help *and* constantly trying to get rebounds by leaving his man open.   I love Westbrook but I don't have horse blinders on.   Here, a couple of articles and videos on the issue.   [The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/11/27/16702738/nba-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-problem) which touches on this problem. Here's few relevant sentences from the article: ""Westbrook is far from Curry’s level as a shooter, but at present, he offers virtually nothing when he doesn’t have the ball.""  ""But Westbrook is a reluctant screener. He logged only one screen assist all of last season and has had just four this season."" An entire season, just *one* screen. Soak that in.  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymP_nu8o-to) by Bballbreakdown. Plenty there but 5:15 is a really good example.  Both sources has more in-depth stuff but you can read/watch yourself.  There are a ton more sources but I think two is enough to educate you for today, nephew."
Good chance since he knows the history so well he’s a Russell westbrook fan that changed his flair
"&gt;I think it's far more likely that the shots that come away from the corner get routed towards the basket, closer jump shots off the dribble and attacks to the rim - exactly the aesthetic the NBA wants.  The issue here is that you've explained exactly why this won't happen:   &gt;you have to remember this frees up the defense to focus a little less on the corners as much as it frees up the offense to take less shots from there.  The top of the perimeter 3 is already competing in terms of efficiency with the drives and post-ups.   Those defenders who used to have to guard the corners would now be given more freedom to contain specifically drives and post-ups in the paint.   This would lower the efficiency of both the driving and post-up types of scorers without having much of an impact on the primary scorers who mostly score on the perimeter.   Think about it like playing on a team with poor shooters. Is Russell Westbrook going to be better at driving into the paint if:  1. He has teammates who can shoot 40% from 3?  2. He has teammates who can shoot 30% from 3?  The more efficient those shooters are, the harder it is to justify trapping his drives. Removing the corner 3 is a hard reduction in terms of the efficiency of those corner 3 shooters.   If a corner 3 and a drive to the basket both net the same amount of points (2), then **every** team in the league is going to sag off corner shooters to contain the higher % driving threat. It's just math.   &gt;The issue I'm trying to address is ""not enough inside play""   The issue of not enough inside play isn't solved by reducing the spacing on the court... Corner shooters are a huuuuuuuge part of what makes a driving/post-up style offence viable in today's game.  That's why teams are always trying to surround guys like Lebron/Giannis/Embiid with shooters.  Reducing their impact only means that teams can commit more to shutting down Lebron/Giannis/Embiid/etc.   All the while, guys who score out on the top of the perimeter will be relatively unaffected.   &gt;I think that improves without the corner 3 in the present day league where most players simply can't do those moves with any sort of reliable efficiency.  Right but after years of having a rule that gives a huge advantage to Harden/Curry style players what you'll see is that kids coming into the league will place a greater emphasis on developing those skills and teams will invest heavily in players who have those skills.  Again, this is what happened with the 90s ISO style. It was a rare skill, but then people realised it was so effective everyone jumped on it and suddenly everyone was doing it.  ***  If anything, physically widening the court would be your best bet to increase inside play.   That allows you to make the 3PT line a proper semi-circle rather than the arc with tapered sides that it is now.  In order to create opportunities for guys to work inside you need to create space for them to work. Widening the court would create the effect you are looking for, while also reducing the efficiency of the corner 3, which is so effective right now because it's 3 points for a 2-point range shot."
"&gt; Even in the playoffs, Westbrook was avoiding Dame and CJ  It's crazy to me to hear this from people repeatedly. Westbrook wasn't avoiding them, it's obviously the coaches call who guards who. You really think Russell Westbrook would back down from guarding someone?"
"Kyrie Irving, especially as a point guard. In my opinion, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Damian Lillard have each been better PGs than him. Wall and Chris Paul drop off lately, because Wall is out and Chris Paul is older. Kyrie was routinely among the ranks of top 5 point guards anyway, even before Lebron returned to Cleveland.  Though he absolutely stepped up in the 2016 NBA Finals, some view his time as Lebron's teammate as if Lebron was 1A and Kyrie was 1B. If Lebron sat, then there was a very good chance that the team would lose (the Cavs record during that time, w/o Lebron, was abysmal).  Also, the talk of Kyrie saving Lebron's legacy got a bit out of hand."
"Nah, this is completely forgetting the huge hole we had in the frontcourt. People put too much of the blame on IT, as others explained we had some good defences with him.   The size was a disadvantage, but Russell Westbrook being bottom 5 league-wide in contesting shots was an even bigger disadvantage. OKC still had a great defensive team.  What really killed us was the fact we were playing Smart as a 6'4 SF, 6'6 Jae as a PF and then all our big men were soft. The reason we jumped to #1 defensively in 2017-18 wasn't because we swapped out IT for Kyrie (who's just not a defensive game-changer)... It's because:  * We swapped 6'2 Avery for 6'7 Brown * We swapped 6'4 Smart for 6'9 Tatum * We swapped 6'6 Jae for 6'10 Horford * We swapped 6'10 Horford for 6'10 Baynes (and is one of the toughest bigs around) * We used Smart more in key areas rather than being forced to use him just to add size * Off the bench we had 6'8 Marcus Morris, who kind of replaced nobody, because we just didn't have a big wing like that the year before.  We went from having arguably one of the weakest front-courts in the league to suddenly having so much frontcourt depth it ended up seeping into our backcourt and having big men who made a name for themselves shutting down dominant opposition bigs.  eg. Drummond went destroying us to not scoring once in the 26 minutes he was guarded by Baynes."
I didn't know Rockit was the ad on Houstons jersey. I wonder if we could get a George Russell / Russell Westbrook collab on a vid in the future.
"Pretty silly logic. Russell Westbrook and James Harden are enjoying this ""garbage"" and yet they're multi-million dollar athletes.   Perhaps they're consuming this as part of a bigger scheme (their DIET) instead of it being a choice that determines their habits or overall health."
"&gt; I just think it was bold to attach the word ‘useless’ to Russell Westbrook in any basketball context.   Watch him off ball last season. He never set a pick, never cut backdoor, never out himself in position to spot up shoot (which he shouldnt do anyway cause he's a career .30 3point shooter).   Yeah, that's what I call useless. Same as if you put Curry in the 5 or Lebron as the water boy. Talent is nothing if you're not where you should be."

"What kind of cocaine are people doing in Miami these days?   Aside from the fact that Washington would never do it, that Wall/Beal trade isn’t even realistically legal under the CBA  Russell Westbrook did not want to go to Miami, the Thunder honored his wishes by sending him to Houston so he could play with Harden."

"Watching Ja reminds me of a player that has the athleticism and size of Russell Westbrook, but the pace, fluidity, and poise similar to someone like Chris Paul."
"He hip checked him as Wagner went up and then finished it off with a knee to the balls.  It wasn't just him kinda hitting his head.  That's what folks mean by throwing his body around. If you can't get a block, then you have to know when to not try so hard that you put the other player's health in jeopardy. John Wall kinda does it too sometimes on chasedown blocks. But he's a lot smaller so we haven't seen any injuries happen.  The reason why Dellevadova is kinda considered dirty is because he's the type of player that will shoulder-dive for a ball even if your knees are behind it. An illegal tackle in soccer.

"&gt; had a slight knee injury from what I understand  That's underselling the reality of what's going on with his knee by a pretty considerable margin. [WB had surgery on his right knee before last season,](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1039947669576339461) and then [again *after* last season.](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/russell-westbrook-has-knee-scope-surgery-on-non-shooting-hand/) His most recent surgery represents the sixth surgery he's had on that right knee since Pat Beverley took it out in 2013.   WB looked pretty bad last season, so maybe it's just age as you say, but it's also possible all these knee surgeries are catching up to him. People have long speculated that WB doesn't have the kind of game that will age well when his athleticism begins to wane (because he's such a poor shooter), and whether it's due to a bum knee or his age it certainly looks like we may have started seeing the start of that last season."
"Yes.  &gt;There are some surprising omissions from the list, including MVP seasons from Giannis Antetokounmpo (14.3 WAR) last season and Russell Westbrook (15.3 WAR) in 2016-17. Also, “only” three LeBron seasons crack the Top 20 since 2013-14, which feels low since we are including the playoffs and James-led teams made the NBA Finals five times in those six seasons. But most of the usual suspects are indeed present, including four entries from last season alone (courtesy of Harden, George, Nikola Jokić and Curry)"
So? Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley worked out. Russell Westbrook is basically Francis with less shooting ability

"Still goes against what you're saying. There aren't many players better than KD so to say ""players of his caliber never"" is probably true given there's not many of those guys.  But Paul George left Westbrook. Kyrie forced a trade away from Lebron. Kawhi left the team that just won the finals. Jimmy Butler left the Sixers for Miami when the Sixers have 3? players better than anyone on Miami's roster. Players leave good situations. Players leave other MVP caliber players to chose their own path.  I mean Kyrie left Lebron fucking James who is way better than Russell Westbrook. It's doesn't ""never"" happen"
Dame is 15-13 career head-to-head vs Russell Westbrook and 4-1 in the playoffs.  The narrative that Russ has been dogging Dame his whole career is complete delusion.  Russ has won exactly as many championships as Dame and has unquestionably vastly superior talent around him his ENTIRE career.

"There are other players in the NBA besides Lebron, the reaction to Morey's tweet dragged all of them into the mess as well.   What about all the players who never claimed to be activists? There are plenty of guys who never said shit about politics ? I'm pretty sure someone like Kyle Kuzma was probably hoping he could get through the season without being embroiled in international geopolitical drama.   James Harden or Russell Westbrook never claimed to be outspoken. Russ literally doesn't talk to the media about basketball not to talk of politics.. So why are they getting microphones shoved in their face to answer for something their GM said? It's a legitimate question."

"He didn't sort of apologize, he straight up apologized.  ""We apologize. You know, we love China.

All the responses have been weak and do not align with what are supposed to be crucial American values of freedom of speech without governmental persecution, a democratic process, and the right to peacefully protest.   If they don't want to be direct they can simply say ""I believe all humans have the right to speak freely without fear of persecution from the government, the right to a fair and open democratic process, and the right to peacefully protest."""

NBA.com is wrong.

Holy shit. Russell Westbrook is a historically garbage shooter lmao. Who gave this man an MVP? 😂
"I think Wilt also made the playoffs every year, so the comparison is still apt.  He even made 6 NBA finals, and won 2, but was still considered to not be as winning of a player as Bill Russell.  The quote attributes Russell's greater number of championships to a winning mentality stemming from a team-focused mindset, as opposed to Wilt's individual-focused mindset.  I think there's an interesting comparison to be made to Westbrook, as he too seems to be showing the same love for individual stats that Wilt did, and he too has not achieved the success to go along with the gaudiness of his stats.  edit: also I realize my original comment was pretty shit cause I wrote it on my phone.  Maybe it was unclear that I was saying: Wilt was also called out for not winning championships because he was too selfish.  In response, he led the league in assists, to show that he was not selfish.  He also focused on setting the record for FG%.   Similarly, Westbrook, in this quote, talks about how people called him out for being a ball hog [and blamed the thunder's lack of championships on that], but then he led the league in assists for 3 years.  Similarly, he believes these box score statistics can invalidate criticisms against himself, whereas Bill Russell (according to Simmons) would pay no attention to statistics other than rings.  Similarly, Westbrook also talks about improving his shooting in this quote, just like Wilt wanted to improve his FG%: ""He'd accomplish one goal, then go on to another."""

"""not particularly efficient""  That's an understatement. And it's the problem with 90% of Westbrook analysis on this sub. You're glossing over the tangible fact that Russell Westbrook had the least efficient shooting season for a volume shooter in NBA history. Ever.   He is a good passer. But that doesn't even begin to tip the scale of Westbrook becoming an effective, winning player when he's shooting so much, so poorly.   And he proves it three years running in the playoffs now.   People want to pretend he's the same player from his MVP season, and he's not even close to that. And that's just a fact."

yeah like how can you be such an active voice for things amongst our country to then go the russell westbrook route when asked asked about such a polarizing political subject
"Yeah but Westbrook's box score stats were just in another universe in every other respect. On a per 36 basis 11 rebounds to 3.3, 10.7 assists to 3.4, 1.9 steals to 0.6, On/Off isn't much better. Westbrooks ORtg to DRtg was 105 to 103, Sexton's? 101 to *121*. Abysmal.  You're saying that Collin Sexton's best attribute by far was marginally better than Russell Westbrook's absolute worst quality, and that somehow makes them comparable despite Westbrook blowing Sexton out of the water in every other respect."
Russell Westbrook forever and always
"Ok, so then someone should ask it to more than just James Harden and Russell Westbrook."
It's very obvious now the Russell Westbrook is a system QB /s
"The guy is attempting to argue that because harden beat the KD warriors 5 times in over four yrs, that harden is better than kawhi. Not accounting for that harden did not win a single series.  Harden is great no question but in the playoffs the game slow down. Why would I pick an isolation heavy player not named Kevin Durant over kawhi Leonard or even LeBron James? I'd pick Steph over harden too.  Curry can play on ball and really good off the ball. Harden is ball dominant. He had a generational point guard in Paul and rumors said he argued with him because harden wanted Chris Paul to move without the ball more.  The plan with Westbrook is to make Russell who is less efficient with shotmaking to be the off ball player.   Harden is stubborn. That's where his frustration comes in then it leaks onto the team and they lose"

"&gt;But that’s exactly the thing. I’m not saying he’s prime Kawhi levels. Prime defensive Kawhi is likely a top 3 perimeter defender of all time. Even a step or two down from that is still all defence level.  Kawhi isn’t a step or two down from his DPOY days. He’s like 4 or 5 steps behind. That’s my whole point.  &gt;Defensive metrics can be extremely misleading. If we’re going by defensive win shares you’ll see names like Kyrie Irving, JJ Redick, and Russell Westbrook above Kawhi. Are you seriously going to sit here and tell me those 3 guys are better defender than Kawhi Leonard? Come on bro  Defensive win shares is a shit tier defensive statistic. Come on bro. No wonder you don’t trust defensive metrics, it’s because you don’t understand them.  B-ball index has a really simplified but good defensive grading system. They simplify their formula down to a percentile ranking but they have explanations on their site. They have him as a good but not near-elite defender.   Analysis  on DRPM, DPIPM and DRPAM all have shown to strongly predict wins. They have him as an above average defender but not close to elite.   Also, yes defensive metrics can be miselading and they aren’t perfect. You know what’s magnitudes more misleading though? The eye test. None of us here break down game tape at the level to where we can be totally sound in our analysis. When we watch a game on TV we are watching for entertainment purposes mainly. We aren’t clued in to the defensive responsibilities or schemes that the team has discussed and divided amongst themselves, and it’s literally impossible for our eyes to track and analyze 5 players at once. We miss a lot of stuff and we have lots of personal biases.   Unless you’re spending 30+ hours a week pouring over gametape then defensive metrics are better at analyzing players than us. Those defensive metrics are made to filter out the bias and only be objective.  &gt;I know you’re a Lakers fan and you want to tell yourself anything possible to make yourself believe the Lakers are better than the Clippers, and you very well may be right. But you don’t have to reduce Kawhi’s skills to do so. Have faith in your team.  So you have no evidence at all to backup your claim that Kawhi is an elite defender other than “I watch many Kawhi games”, so you go on and attack my flair? Lmao.   Look through my post history and you’ll see me declaring the Clippers as a top team. I just think that the strength of the team will be on the offensive side, they legit have a shot to be the best in the league on that end.   I haven’t ever once declared the Clippers as definitively better than the Lakers either. Because I believe the teams are neck and neck and there’s no one clear winner between those two."
"&gt; The gametape across the whole year. His regressed defense was noticeable from the jump. I ain’t gonna lie he did pick it up in the playoffs but it still was far from prime Kawhi levels.  But that’s exactly the thing. I’m not saying he’s prime Kawhi levels. Prime defensive Kawhi is likely a top 3 perimeter defender of all time. Even a step or two down from that is still all defence level.  &gt; Well the narrative is that he is an all-defense type of player. If anything I’m against the narrative and it’s you that’s going with the narrative.  That’s absolutely not the narrative anymore. It’s shifted so far the other way to the point where people believe Kawhi to be slightly above average.  &gt; I also don’t know how you can genuinely believe that with Siakam and Gasol having the years they did. Green was also shadowing the oppositions best wing the majority of the regular season and was stellar last year too. I can see you making the case for him over Lowry because PG defense is less important, but Kawhi has no case over Gasol, Siakam and Green imo. Worth noting that across the board every defensive metric has him behind those four.  1. Kawhi guarded the best wing quite a bit. Not sure what you’re talking about.  2. Defensive metrics can be extremely misleading. If we’re going by [defensive win shares](https://stats.nba.com/players/defense/?sort=DEF_WS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) you’ll see names like Kyrie Irving, JJ Redick, and Russell Westbrook above Kawhi.

Curry  Lillard  Westbrook   (Wall)  Irving  Lowry  Walker  Paul   Simmons  Conley   Russell
There's a list of meaningful playoff games I can pull up where Russell Westbrook was a very effective basketball player.
1. Curry  2. Lillard  3. Third Eye  4. Westbrook  5. Kemba  6. Simmons  7. CP3  8. Kyle  9. Conley  10. Fox (because Russell is probably gonna be a 2 this year)
"This is like when it was reported the Thunder ""took calls on the possibility of trading Russell Westbrook on draft night"""
Russell Westbrook is an effective basketball player in meaningful playoff games.
Russell Westbrook vs OKC
Russell fucking Westbrook.
"As a Russell Westbrook fan, I agree with this message?"
"I actually go to WNBA games pretty regularly in Las Vegas. It's a really good way to see NBA stars.  I've seen LeBron, CP3, Westbrook, Bill Russell and sat next to Greg Oden.  The quality of play is probably high level high school or D3 men's basketball. The women just don't have the explosive strength to play above the rim."
"Yeah I get that. I thought Kawhi was pretty quiet too and still do, but I know that's just not how he's seen now. And one last thing: when I said Russell, I was talking about D-lo. I know westbrook has been getting mercilessly shit on for years"
Russell Westbrook? Donkey? Steph Curry? Kyrie Irving? They are all just as if not more controversial as Lebron. Lebron isn't even controversial.
"He would be more than decent, slightly better than Russell Westbrook is currently in terms of percentage, if he played in this era in my opinion. The mechanics of his shot aren’t conducive to elite three point shooting, but his mid range talent was absolutely unmatched, so if he wanted to practice threes as much as he practiced twos he’d be pretty good. It’s hard to picture MJ being bad at anything basketball related tbh, besides owning a team lol"
"&gt; Duncan and KG were both far far far superior defenders in the same era and it’s not even close. In the same way Russell Westbrook  stat pads because teammates scheme for it, the piston did the same for Ben  Theres nephew comments and then theres embarrassing shit like this"
"Anyone who thinks he’s a top five defender didn’t watch the league. Definitely will make it but this notion that rebounding makes him a great defender is so exaggerated. Rodman could switch and guard tons of positions, Ben could not and was super slow in transition defense. Duncan and KG were both far far far superior defenders in the same era and it’s not even close. In the same way Russell Westbrook  stat pads because teammates scheme for it, the piston did the same for Ben"
"westbrook is an awful, awful player.  Bottom uhhh... 10? in the league.  Get this man out of the league.  Russell Westbrook is a bad bad player.  So bad.  Very bad."
"i mean i think u might be right but if we really tried to measure ""bashed"" as a metric, most of LeBron's would be pre-Cleveland return. or even before he won his first title with the Heat. since at least Cleveland he has been more revered than slandered nationally. Russ has been slandered since joining the league, and at LEAST since the 2012 finals. he was the scapegoat for that loss and was always the less-liked superstar, maybe even less than Harden when he was in OKC. Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for only the second time in history, something for which Oscar Robertson received only the highest praise, and indeed, that nobody thought would EVER be done again. after Russ did it (then did it again two more times in a row), the national conversation immediately switched to how the triple double is an overrated stat and really doesn't mean anything. which, sure. MAYBE it is. but no one would dare say that or even think that before Russ did it. for over 50 years it was regarded as a HUGE accomplishment to get a triple double, for over 50 years no one thought it could ever be possible to average a triple double for a season, overnight it became an overrated stat. with the exception of Reggie Jackson (who had beef for personal reasons), no teammate has ever spoken negatively about playing with Russ. in fact, only the opposite. ""he's such a great teammate! he makes everyone better!"" even KD went on one of his burner accounts to praise him (while slandering everyone else). still, the national conversation insists he's a terrible teammate and nobody wants to play with him. though proven to have no evidence, this narrative is carried on because people want it to be true. it just has to be.   LeBron was bashed a lot for a period of time for his decision; Russ has been consistently bashed damn near as much for almost a decade for everything he does, including his accomplishments."
Russell Westbrook passing montages are already on Youtube bro
This is gonna be unpopular but Russell Westbrook. Cant necessary shoot the lights out but he’s always playing full effort and is always doing the dirty work.
"&gt; Russell Westbrook can make fun of your 3-point shot  Brodie shot 29% from 3 and will likely fall below 30% for his career next year, I don't think he has the right to make fun of anybody's 3pt shot."
"Because Kobe is one of the greatest players of all time and Durant is just one of the best scorers. One is always mentioned synonymously  with tenacity, his glare and killer instinct. The other is always mentioned with Scoring, Leaving and Russell Westbrook. But maybe that’s just me. Idk."

"Let’s look at the MVPs the past couple years  2019: Giannis, DPOY level fair 2018: Harden, underaverage defender 2017: Westbrook, at best average defender 2016: Curry, average defender 2015 Curry, Average defender 2014 Durant above average not all star level defender  Offense matters so much more than defense. Players like Harden, IT, Russell, Trae, are all able to be all nba type (Capt Trae yet) even though their defense isn’t great. Team defense is way more important than individual and center defense too is more important. So yeah I would say it’s 3x as important"

Giving $30+m each to two guys who have never delivered your team a win in the conference finals is not a good use of the salary cap.  These are the next Chris Paul/John Wall/Russell Westbrook contracts
"Okay so no actual argument then, just a shittier version of ""RINGZZZ"".  Russell Westbrook has an MVP and has actually made a Finals appearance, guess that means he's better than AD *and* Giannis."
"Damn, it's crazy even though today there are a lot of NBA players from California, there weren't too many of them 30+ years ago. Bill Russell counts since he moved to CA when he was 8 and played all his high school basketball and college here. But after him (in no particular order) probably Harden, Kawhi, PG, and Westbrook."
"Wait, you're thinking Westbrook could be better than Anthony Davis this year? Russell Westbrook? The guy who just got traded to Houston for Chris Paul, that Westbrook? *Really?!*"
Too many to name but here’s a list of the best he’s played on the finals:  Dirk Nowitzki  Jason Kidd Tyson Chandler  Kevin Durant x3 Russell Westbrook James Harden Tim Duncan x3 Kawhi Leonard x2 Tony Parker x3 Manu Ginobli x3 Stephen Curry x4 Klay Thompson x4 Draymond Green x4 Iguodala x4
"&gt; Usage rate bro! That's all you need to know! If anyone was better, they would have been in control of more possessions!  Russell Westbrook with the casual 47% usage rate vs Houston in 2017 playoffs, absolute GOAT"
"While this is the truth, J lIn wouldn't bring in as much viewership as a superstar though. Would you pay to watch a WNBA game, or to see ""Russell Westbrook practicing in a WNBA game""? Because that's essentially what it is."
"&gt;In his prime he was a legit superstar and a top 7 or so player in the league. He wasn't putting up empty stats, he was a historically good scorer. Melo made the playoffs in ten years straight   Melo scored a lot of points, but he was never a historically good scorer. I call them empty stats because his efficiency was never at the level that his counting stats would suggest. For instance, he won the scoring title in 2012-2013. In that same year, he was 57th in effective field goal percentage. How did he win the scoring title with an eFG that low, you ask? Well, he had the league's highest usage rate, topping number 2 (Russell Westbrook) by 2.8 points. That also rated as the 15th highest usage rate season by a player in the history of the NBA.  Melo made 10 straight playoffs, and also happens to literally be the losingest playoff performer of all time (25-48 all time, for a 34.2% playoff winrate).  &gt; led his team to the playoffs as the best player on his team *as a rookie*.   Funny story, but Melo was actually the 4th best player on that Denver team, based on value over replacement player, that year (his 1.6 VORP rated well behind Andre Miller's 3.4, Marcus Camby's 3.3, and Nene's 2.4).  &gt; People forget that Melo vs. Lebron was an actual conversation early on in both guys careers.   If you mean his rookie season, then yes, but any season after that, no.  &gt; but he's still an ATG and first ballot HOF   He will get into the Hall of Fame because of his counting stats, and his accolades (all star appearances, etc), but he is not an all time great. He is a me-first chucker who always cared more about his counting stats than his team's success.  In some ways, he is a player who lived in the wrong era, because the emergence of advanced stats have shown the world why his teams always under-performed expectations. In his best season, Melo was 13th in the league in value over replacement player (just ahead of Goran Dragic and just behind D'Andre Jordan). In his second best season, he was 33rd (tied with Matt Barnes and Josh Smith that season). He simply was never remotely as good as his reputation suggested."
"Here's what you must have missed on PG lately to make people hate him: after making a huge show of being all in in his commitment to the Thunder a year ago, PG demanded to be traded to the Clippers. He then lied to the press and said it was ""mutual"" between he and the Thunder, which Sam Presti emphatically denied. This trade demand led to the Thunder shockingly having to blow everything up and trade local hero Russell Westbrook as a result.  That clear it up for why he's become so disliked around here?"
"Steve Francis - Michael Vick  Francis was the first hyper-athletic point guard, the prototype for guys like Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook. He really changed the perception of what a point guard's role could be, this really reminds me of the athletic QB revolution started by Vick in the NFL."

Russell Westbrook
"I have as many 60 point games as Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook combined"
"I honestly never thought I'd see a day on this sub where Russell Westbrook, coming off historically the worst shooting season for a volume guard EVER, is defended tooth and nail, and Paul George, coming off an MVP candidate season, is being ridiculed.   Unbelievable. All day it's been shit on Paul George day."
"hmm. have gotten temp bans here over...  Jeremy Lin, Lonzo Ball, and Russell Westbrook"
This is so stupid. Now all they can do is hope that they eventually get a player or two as good as Paul George and Russell Westbrook with those picks.
Russell Westbrook GOAT at that.
Russell Westbrook GOAT at that.
"So your saying Bartolo Colon and Russell Westbrook have ""identical skillsets"" because they have 2 kinda similar characteristics of being able to throw accurately &amp; threading a needle?     I think an actual needle worker has more in common with Russ than Bartolo Colon does."
"2017 is the big elephant in the room when it comes to this  &amp;#x200B;  last 20 mvps and their teams records  2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo 60-22  2018 James Harden 65-17  2017 Russell Westbrook 47-35  2016 Steph Curry 73-9  2015 Steph Curry 67-15  2014 Kevin Durant 59-23  2013 Lebron James 66-16  2012 Lebron James 46-20 (same win % in an 82 game season would be 57-25)  2011 Derrick Rose 62-20  2010 Lebron James 61-21  2009 Lebron James 66-16  2008 Kobe Bryant 57-25  2007 Dirk Nowitzki 67-15  2006 Steve Nash 54-28  2005 Steve Nash 62-20  2004 Kevin Garnett 58-24  2003 Tim Duncan 60-22  2002 Tim Duncan 58-24  2001 Allen Iverson 56-26  2000 Shaquille O'Neal 67-15  &amp;#x200B;  Westbrook's MVP season had the worst team record by far, 7 games back from the second worst (Steven Nash 2006)  &amp;#x200B;  That season is a exception, not the rule"
"IMO  I think that as long as no injuries happen, Fox is the more versatile and well-rounded player - he's pretty solid on defense, and he's *so fast*.   Trae feels almost like the second coming of Steph Curry, but he's shorter, and while he might have the offense, I don't think he'll have the defense; Fox feels more like a John Wall or a Russell Westbrook type, and I feel like the speed and versatility will make him much harder to gameplan for in a few years than Trae.  &amp;#x200B;  I think they're both going to be dominant, though!"
"&gt; 29/8/11 on 61% TS vs 31/10/10 on 55% TS. What exactly do you mean by “better box stats”? 2 uncontested rebounds? Is that what you mean? Harden had better stats then westbrook, I don’t give a shit about triple doubles and uncontested rebounds. He was significantly more efficient while putting up the same counting stats with a better team record, he was better in every way. “Every impact stat possible” my ass lmao  Jesus Christ, you are a Harden stan.   But I will entertain this terrible take: LOL.  Box stats are fully represented by stats like bpm. Purely looking at what they put up is not ""box stats"" because they don't account for possession differences, etc.   Oh, interesting!   Russell destroys James Harden by a huge margin in Bpm, and win shares/48, and per, and VORP, and every possible box stats possible.   You know what the most fucking HILARIOUS thing is?   You are somehow using efficiency to push an agenda that Harden had a better season that year. This is hilarious because the efficiency gap is not huge... at all:  Harden put up 38.4/14.8 in 61.3% TS/19.5% TOV.   RW put up 44.8/14.7 in 55.4% TS/15.9% TOV.  How in GOD'S NAME is Harden seen as having a hugely more efficient year that year? Seriously?   Russell put up exactly the same amount of assists, with over 6 more points per possessions, while around 2% less efficient. Are you somehow going to argue TOV% for high volume players shouldn't be used for efficiency? You can't be that dumb... right?   It's quite hilarious, despite Harden's ""INSANE BOX STATS (Lol)"" which isn't that insane because of his truckload of TOV,  Rocket's offense doesn't even go up to any significant degree WITH Harden. You are telling me having huge amounts of TOV doesn't help your offense as much as it should? lol  Rockets with Harden: Plus 7, without: plus 3.7.  Thunder with RW: Plus 4, without: -8.5  And of course we can purely look at RAPM:   Harden is at 2.   RW is a 3.05.  Lol.  &gt; Except I’m not though? Harden had better stats and the better record. I don’t care about 2 uncontested rebounds.  Yeah except differences weren't two uncontested rebounds. buddy. it was far bigger.   &gt; LMAO. You consider 25.5/3.5 “slightly worse” then 29/11? Holy shit that’s absolutely delusional. I guess Harrison Barnes was also slightly worse then Kawhi offensively too.   Yes, when you are turning over the ball at massive rate; Your play won't inflate the offense as it should.   This is what's fucking hilarious tho:   Kawhi's per/ws48 is higher than Harden's. Harden's bpm is significantly higher than Kawhi. In terms of box stats, these are even.   Harden gives you 10 more assists per possession while scoring slightly lower than Kawhi per possession... so why is this not a huge difference?   BECAUSE JAMES HARDEN  HAS 10 MORE TOV%. It's insane to me how people always use efficiency for high volume players but completely fail to to%, which is as important as TS. Oh, you want to excuse Harden's to% because he held the ball more? This would make no sense since I would very much rather take kawhi's portability and flexibility offensively, over a ball-dominant style of play. Don't get me Harden was the better offensive player, I just don't think it's significant, and neither does anyone.   Purely offensively btw:   Kawhi: +10  Harden: +6.6  And their on offensive rating is similar lol.    &gt; Kawhi had Aldridge, a true star next to him, to have a better record then the rockets.  Ah yes. Aldridge made that big of a difference lol.  Despite Kawhi having significantly higher impact stat (5.3 vs 2).  Putting extremely efficient offensive numbers. It's because of Aldrige Spurs had a tipping point in their favor over the rockets.   &gt; Not really. Harden took us to the 2nd seed with tarik black at center, Jason Terry at point (40 years old), and brewer and josh smith to kick it out for 3. Absolute bums on our roster and we were 2nd, and curry was on a stacked roster with 2 stars multiple all nba defensive players and a deep bench. Harden deserved that award  This is pretty much garbage.   So once again, in terms of box stats: Curry beat Harden in every single metric. Per, WS/48, and Bpm are all in Curry's favor while significantly more efficient in every way.   But let's look at your point, shall we?   Harden deserves to win despite having an atrocious team and winning alot. I can see that argument! So let's see if the numbers are true!  With Harden, Rockets are plus 5.7, and without him, Rockets are -3. -3 Without your main creator is actually not bad.   With Curry, GSW are plus whopping 16.7, and with out him? Warriors are **-1.4**. So both teams are in the negatives when their best players are out..... but Curry's team become the best in the world when he plays. If you were to regularize the numbers, Curry would look significantly better than Harden.  Curry was def better than Harden. Harden has his arguments for MVP that season, however. Although, Curry deserved it much more imo."

"I hardily disagree with this.   The Raptors have a) put forth a championship-worthy team, that happened to win the championship b) not wound up in an unfixable position the next season, the team is not in shambles for 2019-20. That is prime Spurs philosophy. That is basically the goal of the NBA. You can't do any better to put yourself in a position to win a championship, and it was in large part because of Kawhi. So no, while the narrative would probably been different, but the enduring fact is still that healthy Kawhi is a top 3 NBA player. That was the risk, but the fallout (that he leaves, which he did) still wasn't that bad. They're still in a decent position to recycle the process, and have hardware on the shelf. Their first franchise championship, no less. Boss move, obviously made cooler by the fact that they did win, but the team strategy was excellent.   The Thunder paid for a max guy in free agency after losing 2 of the 3 best draft picks in franchise history to free agency. PG had also declared at a Russell Westbrook party that he was ""\[t\]here to stay"", and this year he was an All-NBA player, and MVP candidate on a team that already had an MVP winner on it, and had signed a 4 year deal. If you're concerned about the cap and luxury tax you've got to recognize that some contracts are going to need to go. Otherwise, this went great minus a PG injury. He definitely contributing to their winning and fan interest. The team was not good enough to win a championship without him at full-strength, due to an unexpected injury. It happens, but still, pretty good season. In 2019-20, they're mostly out from under the massive contracts, with a good, aging star in Chris Paul, who projects to continue to slow down but is still one of the GOAT PGs and still direct a game. Losing Russ still hurts, but the assets gained in the PG deal create a massively bright future for a small market team that may struggle to attract free agents going forward. They traded him for an INSANE deal and, while you'd rather have the two stars (which shows that going for stars is indeed worth it), getting literally **the greatest load of draft assets for a player that has told you he's planning to leave the team in free agency** is a pretty 2nd place.    So, OKC went from a good team with a pending luxury tax deadline to an under-the-tax team with a good young core and a TON of picks. Without the trade happening they had PG and RW next season, also not too shabby.   The only thing that had to go right for both of these players was their injury risk. Their fight risk was proven to be well worth it.   **Source:** A Hornets fan. Who lost Kemba for nothing, Jaylen Brown and Tatum for a goofy guy from Wisconsin and not even Justice Winslow,, and paid way way too much for Terry Rozier, who played in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6GJPVeQMOQ) game."
They will now get cock blocked from within. Russell westbrook send his regards.
Russell Westbrook: “what?”
Russell Westbrook being in the esteemed company of Kevin Knox (could be argued to be one of the worst rotation players) and Andrew Wiggins (one of the worst contracts in the NBA) is not a good thing to use in his defense.
"I was curious if he was actually the most inefficient high volume shooter for the season last year and had a bit of time on my hands so I crunched some data.  **Short answer:** Sort of. He was the least efficient player last year if you set an arbitrarily high bar for shooting volume.  **Long Answer:**  No one will probably read this because it's in a deep comment thread in a thread no one will read, but I did the research so I want to post what I found.  The first thing I did was calculate the adjusted field goals attempted (aFGA) for each player. Basically, I added FGA and 0.44*FTA together to get a better picture of every shot attempt, whether that resulted in makes, misses, or fouls. This is also conveniently the denominator of TS%. I eliminated all players that didn't play more than half the season and set an arbitrary filter of &gt;12 aFGA. Using TS% as my metric for ""shooting efficiency"", I organized all the players from lowest to highest TS%.  With a filter of &gt;12 aFGA as the bar for ""high volume"", the top 10 least efficient players were:  |**Rank**|**Player**|**aFGA**|**TS%**| --:|:--|--:|--:| |1|[Kevin Knox](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/knoxke01.html)|13.51253333|0.475| |2|[Andrew Wiggins](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wiggian01.html)|18.34575342|0.493| |3|[Russell Westbrook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html)|22.89643836|0.501| |4|[Dennis Smith](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithde03.html)|13.55924528|0.502| |5|[Dennis Schröder](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/schrode01.html)|15.23898734|0.508| |6|[Dwyane Wade](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01.html)|14.75722222|0.51| |7|[Justise Winslow](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/winslju01.html)|12.26181818|0.513| |8|[Collin Sexton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sextoco01.html)|16.07560976|0.52| |9|[Gary Harris](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harriga01.html)|12.28701754|0.526| |10|[Tim Hardaway](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardati02.html)|17.14523077|0.527|  So at an arbitrary cutoff of &gt;12 aFGA, Kevin Knox and Andrew Wiggins are both less efficient than Russ.  Ok but what if we don't consider Kevin Knox a high volume player? Keep in mind this means that we also don't consider players with lower aFGA like Kyle Lowry, Montrezl Harrell, Malcolm Brogdan and Pascal Siakam as high volume scorers. Sorting by TS% now that everyone with an aFGA lower than Kevin Knox, we get:  |Rank|Player|aFGA|TS%| --:|:--|--:|--:| |1|[Andrew Wiggins](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wiggian01.html)|22.89643836|0.493| |2|[Russell Westbrook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html)|15.23898734|0.501| |3|[Dennis Schröder](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/schrode01.html)|14.75722222|0.508| |4|[Dwyane Wade](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01.html)|16.07560976|0.51| |5|[Collin Sexton](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sextoco01.html)|17.14523077|0.52| |6|[Tim Hardaway](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardati02.html)|19.84197531|0.527| |7|[D'Angelo Russell](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russeda01.html)|14.12098765|0.533| |8|[Evan Fournier](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/fournev01.html)|15.44712329|0.536| |9|[Josh Richardson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/richajo01.html)|22.13298701|0.536| |10|[Donovan Mitchell](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mitchdo01.html)|14.8374359|0.537|  Now, Russ is the second least efficient ""high volume"" player after Wiggins. In order to say that Russ is THE definite least efficient player, we have to set Wiggins as the low filter for aFGA. This is essentially calling players like Nikola Vucevic, Lou Williams, Julius Randle, Trae Young, Buddy Hield, Kyle Kuzma, Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Tobias Harris, Brandon Ingram, Khris Middleton, Jimmy Butler, De'Aaron Fox, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, Aaron Gordon, Ben Simmons, and Jayson Tatum **not** volume scorers.  Now, with the list cherrypicked so that Russ is the least efficient player, we have the follow top 10 least efficient ""volume scorers"":  |Rank|Player|aFGA|TS%| --:|:--|--:|--:| |1|[Russell Westbrook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html)|22.89643836|0.501| |2|[D'Angelo Russell](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russeda01.html)|19.84197531|0.533| |3|[Donovan Mitchell](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mitchdo01.html)|22.13298701|0.537| |4|[DeMar DeRozan](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/derozde01.html)|19.57194805|0.542| |5|[Luka Dončić](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doncilu01.html)|19.43611111|0.545| |6|[CJ McCollum](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01.html)|18.964|0.553| |7|[Jrue Holiday](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/holidjr01.html)|19.07820896|0.555| |8|[Kemba Walker](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/walkeke02.html)|22.95121951|0.558| |9|[Mike Conley](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/conlemi01.html)|18.552|0.569| |10|[Klay Thompson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompkl01.html)|18.86564103|0.571|  Let me know if anyone wants a PM of the excel file used to tabulate the data from bball ref.  TL:DR - Yes, Russell Westbrook is the least efficient high volume scorer but only if you consider Klay to be the 10th least efficient high volume scorer, Kemba to be the 8th, and Luka to be the 5th least efficient. Otherwise, no. Wiggins or Knox are the least efficient high volume scorers depending on your definition."
what do u want the league to do? punish Paul George for demanding a trade? punish Russell Westbrook for wanting to leave?   the team didn't want to lose PG or westbrook.  it is the players that wanted out.   do u want to fine PG or Westbrook? suspend them?   what is your solution to the problem?  should the next CBA enforce strict no trade clauses for 3 years for every max contract?
Russell Westbrook waifu pillow :(
"Paul George shot 58.2% TS with Russell Westbrook on the court and 54.4% TS with Russell Westbrook off the court during his entire two-season stint with the Thunder. That's about a +7% increase in TS efficiency.  Season | TS% w/ Russ | TS% w/out Russ | Difference -|-|-|- 2017-18 | 56.8% TS | 55.1% TS | +3.1% 2018-19 | 59.4% TS | 53.9% TS | +10.2%  It'll be super interesting to see how Paul George adjusts from playing with Russell Westbrook as the best playmaking guard, to Louis Williams as the best playmaking guard."
"Well Kyrie has a ring. And handles like no other.  Russell Westbrook is fascinating to watch because he's freakishly athletic, but he is a ball hog that takes extremely difficult shots when he doesn't have to."
"Oh. You didn't get the memo, dude.   Ever since it came out that Russ was going to be traded from OKC, we don't actually acknowledge the last two seasons of his career.   The Rockets just acquired 2016-17 MVP Russell Westbrook."
"Well let's ignore the fact that this whole thing started because you insisted that Westbrook has regressed, but why do you think he needs to be a particularly good 3pt shooter for the things to work out with Harden?  His drives are still gonna be absolutely deadly (even the stats I brought show that), he'll bring more dynamic fastbreak opportunities, just by being able to attack the rim at will and kick the ball back he'll add a whole new layer to their game... I can even see some sets that end with him taking a 3pt shot working well... He's actually not a terrible shooter from the corner... I actually discussed it already over at /r/nbadiscussion and I don't really like putting a point guard in that spot because even though it offers great shooting opportunities it kinda locks you into the execution mode, but there could be plays where he rotates to the corner quickly and gets a shot off.  Also he's now playing in an actual **system**. There's no more shit like ""*Thunder rebounding philosophy*"" that only really makes sense if he makes an outlet pass or catches defense completely sleeping. There's no space for Russell Westbrook the Oklahoma City legend in Houston so it's expected that he adjusts to not be treated like a farewell-tour Kobe 365 days a year.  Of course it might not work out in the end. I'm personally not super huge on the fit to tell you the truth... I mean you have two guys that had to be separated like almost 10 years ago because there's only one ball to play with, and now you expect them to fit nicely together after evolving into the most ball-dominant players in the modern history of the game?  I dunno... My initial reaction to this trade hasn't changed. They're the most volatile team in the league right now. It's either gonna be some of the most fun basketball you can watch with Westbrook and Harden taking turns with highlight reel plays, or it's gonna be one hell of a meltdown... either way I'll have my popcorn ready."
And Russell Westbrook has over seven times as many triple doubles as the Jazz have had since they moved to Utah 40 years ago.
"He was 11th in the league in rebounds in 2018, the only non-centres above him were AD and Russell Westbrook. LeBron and Ben Simmons were the only other non-centres in the top 20. That’s elite."
People who paid to go to every home game next year are mad they have to watch CP3 and Gallinari instead of Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Who would've thought that?
"since becoming the #1 option on the team:   he averaged 32 PPG vs the 73-9 warriors in 2016 when their gameplan was to stop him. not really a bad series, not sure what else he's supposed to do there. he's not lebron james.  in the 2017 playoffs he had to play the warriors again in the first round. put up 28 PPG on 43% shooting from the field, on par with his career reg ssn avg. not really a bad series there, he just faced the most stacked team of all-time. lol.  efficient 33/4/6/2 against the thunder, outplaying both russell westbrook and paul george. definitely not a bad series there.  against the nugs his shooting certainly regressed from the first round, but he definitely wasn't bad. made up for his scoring with more assists and still scored 25 PPG with a TS% of 52.8%.   im really not sure where this narrative comes from that he isnt a good playoff performer. he hasn't had the privilege of playing in the east like a kyrie irving"
"I'm a Robert Covington stan. Always will be. He's my top team defender in the NBA.    Lately, Westbrook stans irritate me because the narrative has become to ignore not only advanced stats, but the last two entire seasons of play. Houston just acquired Russell Westbrook fresh off his 2017 MVP season apparently."

“Russell Westbrook statically is one of the 1% of the NBA that copied Gerald Green’s haircut.”
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?  He has so little body fat that if he put on 15 lbs of fat he would still be super musclear  not to mention calling a guy who is as fast as John Wall and can jump as higher than Blake Griffin and Russell Westbrook
"You’re switching the goalposts. Nowhere did I say he shouldn’t get a job. He’s just not a top half PG, and never broke out of his shooting slump, which is something you claim.  And PER is awful, I’ve no idea why you’re using it to help your argument. Joakim Noah is one rank behind Siakam and doesn’t have a job. Valanciunas has a better PER than Steph Curry. Lou Will has a better PER than Russell Westbrook. Trey Burke has a better PER than Kyle Lowry. Etc"
I think you’re right in theory but the stats say Chris Paul is in the 84th percentile in iso situations with 1.12 points per possession and (Russ)[https://www.bball-index.com/player/russell-westbrook/] is in the 48th percentile at 0.84 ppp.
Rockets legend Russell Westbrook was on the Thunder?
"&gt;An ESPN reporter has clarified comments he made earlier this week saying Kevin Durant told ex-Thunder teammate Russell Westbrook he was going to re-sign with the team this off-season.  &gt;“I misspoke in saying that Durant specifically told Westbrook he was coming back,” ESPN reporter Royce Young wrote on Wednesday.  &gt;These were not direct quotes meant to be attributed to Durant. It was an attempt to characterize what Westbrook thought his situation was going to be in Oklahoma City and how Durant's leaving impacts his thinking about his future.  https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/74520/espns-royce-young-clarifies-podcast-remark-on-durant-westbrook"

"Duncan has more rings than KG, Dirk, Davis, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Carmelo Anthony, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, James Harden, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Blake Griffin, and Kevin Durant combined."
Rockets point guard Russell Westbrook and James Harden have acquired an RV and parked it here on the premises for training camp so they can have a top secret clubhouse. Only guards allowed inside for now and no name yet. They won’t tell me what goes on inside.
"No, it was retracted but once something like that gets out the people who want to believe it will believe it.  &gt;An ESPN reporter has clarified comments he made earlier this week saying Kevin Durant told ex-Thunder teammate Russell Westbrook he was going to re-sign with the team this off-season.  &gt;“I misspoke in saying that Durant specifically told Westbrook he was coming back,” ESPN reporter Royce Young wrote on Wednesday.  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/07/27/kevin-durant-told-russell-westbrook-was-staying-thunder-warriors"
"If your favorite player is Harden I would say go with Houston. Like others have said, they added Russell Westbrook and should be a very exciting duo."
Rockets! The Houston Rockets are awesome and are my favorite team in the league. They have James Harden and Russell Westbrook who a lot of people say is very exciting to watch and James Harden is my favorite player too
Wow. What an intelligent response.   Ben Simmons has made the second round two times in his two seasons. Something Westbrook hasn't done once since Durant left.   Ben Simmons isn't the reason Russell Westbrook can't adjust and play team basketball. Ben Simmons isn't the reason Russell Westbrook loses his teams games when they matter.
"Well Russell Westbrook doesn't have the luxury of being in a trash ass conference where you can get away with having guards on your team who shoot with the wrong hand and still secure home court for the first round, so I'd argue that his leading the thunder to the playoffs actually IS meaningful"
Michael Jordan come back to the court to make a dominant trio with James Harden and Russell Westbrook in Houston
"You're saying we lose Russell Westbrook, Paul George, and Jerami Grant while getting CP3 and SGA and were suddenly better?     You're almost making a jab at Westbrook, YOUR new star PG."

"Very funny rip on the Hornets, and look at what is written for the Rockets... ""They have James Harden and Russell Westbrook"" along with a couple other teams, it must have been hard to say something positive or just something not so negative in order to pull this joke off. Very well done."

"DAE Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook"
"Very nice, this is the spin we’ve been waiting for. It’s not Westbrook they didn’t like, it was his team. Donovan probably forced Westbrook to pad stats. He clearly instructed Steven Adams to box people out but leave the rebound for Russell. A better team would’ve made the extra pass for a cleaner look, which would’ve reduced WBs assist numbers. For the past 3 years of Rockets fans roasting him, Westbrook was simply a misunderstood victim of circumstance."
The thunder is Russell Westbrook
"Yes, Russell Westbrook is confirmed. I don't know why that needed to be said."
What about russell westbrook contested pulpup long 2
"Mitchell isn't the most proven and has particularly struggled against the Rockets in the playoffs. You can definitely make an argument for McCollum. But Mitchell did put up 28.5 points on 23.8 shots with 46/36/92 shooting as the primary option to win a playoff series against Russell Westbrook and Paul George (average game score of 18.6 for a basic overall box score metric). McCollum's best series was the win against the Nuggets this year where he scored 26.4 points on 23.6 shots with 46/37/77 shooting while having more field goal attempts, but still being the second option to Damian Lillard (average game score 17.3). Ignoring his first year where he barely played, McCollum has averaged 20/3.8/2.6 on 17.4 shots with 44/39/79 shooting in the playoffs (average game score 12.3). Mitchell has averaged 23.4/5.6/3.9 on 22 shots with 39/29/83 shooting (average game score 13.0). McCollum's games all came as the second or third option while Mitchell's all came as the number one option. Not that it matters for who is better now, but McCollum was also older for all of those games than Mitchell is now. Basically McCollum has been more efficient overall, Mitchell has been more relied upon as the go-to guy, and Mitchell has the single best playoff series of the two."

Russell Westbrook is John Cena confirmed
"**EAST:** Chicago Bulls - On paper they are a playoff team in the East and I think they make it. Markkanen is a star, Otto Porter is the most underrated player in the NBA (I love the guy), plus Lavine and Wendell Carter Jr. I think they're kinda scary. The Thomas Satoransky pickup was incredibly underrated, plus they added Thaddeus Young and Coby White.  Indiana Pacers - Call me crazy, I realise Oladipo is out for a bit, but I think they're still capable of being a top 3 seed in the East. They were on track for the 3rd seed last year before Oladipo went down. Losing Collison hurts but adding Brogdon, Warren, Lamb, McConnell and Bitadze is huge. I think they could be as high as the 2 seed and as low as the 4 seed.  Orlando Magic - Homer pick but I do think people are sleeping on them. They had the 2nd best, post All-Star break, record in the East (17-8) behind only the Bucks and equal with the Raptors. I think both those teams have regressed while the Magic have slightly improved and could possibly have one of the strongest benches in the East (with or without Markelle Fultz).  Boston Celtics - I don't think this would be all that surprising but after a hugely disappointing season and then losing Kyrie and Horford, a lot of people are ruling them out. I think we see a resurgence from Boston. I think Kemba ends up being a much better fit than Kyrie, I think Gordon Hayward returns to form and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown both make big strides. Losing Horford was a huge blow but I think Robert Williams and Enes Kanter will step up. I'm also high on Grant Williams.   **WEST:** Golden State Warriors - Some people think the Warriors are done. Others think they'll still make the playoffs but aren't really contenders. I think they're my favourites to win it all. I think D'Angelo Russell is an incredibly underrated addition and I think Willie Cauley-Stein will flourish there. They really lack depth again but I think Curry, Draymond and D'Lo is enough to drag them into the playoffs and when Klay returns they become incredibly scary again. I think Alen Smailagic could be a draft steal and might contribute.  Sacramento Kings - I don't think anyone would be that surprised but this team is well and truly capable of making the playoffs in the stacked West. I think they added some great pieces in Dedmon, Ariza, Joseph and Holmes. The young guys will get better too and they sneak in to the 8th seed. Don't really know who misses out. My eyes say Portland but my head/heart says ""You're an idiot. You ruled them out last year and they made the Western Conference Finals. Quit sleeping on the Blazers.""   Denver Nuggets - I don't think this is that surprising but they don't really get talked about so I'm including them. I think they're a top 2 seed again. While the Clippers, Jazz and Lakers have all gotten better I think the Nuggets have too. I'm super high on the Jerami Grant addition and think they have one of the best benches in the league. Also think Gary Harris will bounce back after a injury plagued backwards step. I think the Clippers do some load management and the Nuggets outlast them and the Jazz to claim the 1 seed.    **UNDERPERFORMERS:** Houston Rockets - I still think they're scary but I don't think they've gotten better. In my opinion, Westbrook is possibly a worse fit than CP3 purely on account of being a worse shooter. They finish as the 4th - 6th seed and lose in the first round.  Los Angeles Lakers - I think the Clippers are still the best team in LA. I like the Danny Green and Avery Bradley signings but I can't help but feel like they could've done better in free agency when filling out the roster. I think Rondo is an odd fit on a Lebron team and I kept waiting for Quinn Cook to break out last season but was continually disappointed. I think JaVale McGee is supremely underrated but don't know how much court time he'll see. They flame out in the first or second round.  Miami Heat - I'm a big Jimmy Butler fan but I don't quite see why people are rating the Heat as highly as they are. I think they're going to need elite team chemistry to be good and I can easily see that not happening. A lot of websites have them as the 5th seed but I think they could be down with Chicago and Detroit, battling for the 8th seed."

2012 Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
"I think basketball doesn’t do as great of a job of passing on the history of the game as baseball or hockey or even football. Most young fans probably don’t know many players before the 90’s besides Magic, Bird, Wilt, Russell, Dr. J.  Oscar Robertson did what Westbrook did 50 years ago but he’s practically forgotten about"
Speed of prime John Wall  Shooting ability of Wardell Curry  Defensive Tenacity of Kyle Lowry  Ferocity of Russell Westbrook  Finishing ability of Kyrie Irving  Balls of Damian Lillard
"hey thanks for the comment! the main reason i presented this was for that exact reason, i'm not entirely sure how to properly ""weigh"" these statistics. An assist is counted as just an assist, but does it lead to 2 points or 3? how could we adjust or factor for that?  same thing with rebounds, an offensive rebound is generally more ""important"" than a defensive rebound as it more often directly leads to an immediate chance to score, but how exactly do we determine which should be ""weighed""?  tbh i have no idea how to weigh it, that's why i included broad averages. also i can see how you view this as redundant but the reason i included ORB, DRB and TRB is that guards and big men will have different expectations in terms of rebounding. I think Steph Curry is a very underrated rebounder, but he won't be a ""better"" rebounder than say DeAndre Jordan, however there's no comparison between the two when talking about shooting. However, Steph Curry's offensive rebounds should still be included when you consider James Harden, Russell Westbrook and others also have the opportunity to get offensive and defensive rebounds. So it compares how you are not only in terms of total rebounding, but offensive and defensive as well, as i think both are important for different reasons   i think including those 3 also ""balances"" the fact that 3P shots have exploded in popularity and volume. DeAndre Jordan will never shoot 4 3P/game just like Steph Curry will mostly likely never get 10+ rebounds in a game. So his 0.7 Offensive rebounds/Game should even out with his ~5 3PA per game when you compare him to say DeAndrew Jordan who averages about 3 ORB for his career with no 3s if that makes sense."
Russell Westbrook is third all-time in Assist % and has led the league in points created off assists three times   The only joke here is your comment

I think Russell Westbrook playing safety would be terrifying. John wall and daaron fox as kick returners. Ben Simmons as a tight end too. Giannis as a swimmer holy shit. And Dame has the perfect mentality for a closing pitcher
Kill Russell Westbrook
I love Russell Westbrook and I’m excited to watch him and Harden reunited. Fuck the Rockets.

I agree because I am the exact same way. When I am watching Russell Westbrook and ONLY RUSSELL WESTBROOK I actually really like his game and I notice he is really that special player some people say he is at times. Then when im on YouTube or Reddit or any other kinda interactive typa expressive platform I see all the gross childish Westbrook fans and it just brings out that naysayer in me idk what it is.
That is pretty wild. I think Russell Westbrook is their age too.
Russell Westbrook more important to OKC than Kevin Durant
"Locks: Steph Curry, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Nikola Jokic, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Damian Lillard  Probably get in: Russell Westbrook, Karl Towns  Good chance to get in: CJ McCollum, LaMarcus Aldridge  Somewhat of a chance to get in: Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell, DeMar DeRozan, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker  Longshots: De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield, Kristaps Porzingis"
"I've always seen Russell Westbrook as the most ferocious and hard-hitting player in the NBA since Kevin Garnett. Never hated the guy, always loved his style. Although now love him even more now that he's a Rocket."

"Find me another player with his reputation that only has one season above 10 win shares. You can't find that either.  For perspective, there were 11 players who topped 10 win shares this year.

In terms of win shares, Melo's best season (10.7 win shares) most closely resembles Clint Capela's season this past year (10.8 win shares).  Meanwhile, they put Melo on the same half-decade team as Chris Paul, who has 8 seasons above 10 win shares this decade (11 total, topping out at 18.3 win shares), and Russell Westbrook, who had 5 seasons above 10 win shares this decade (topping out at 14).  Melo once won the scoring title in a year where he was 57th in the league in true shooting percentage. Melo denied LeBron from winning unanimous MVP that season because some writer gave him a first place vote. LeBron literally doubled Melo's win shares that year (19.3 to 9.5), as Melo finished third in MVP voting while finishing 14th in the league in win shares and 33rd in value over replacement player (which doesn't value volume as much as win shares do), which tied him with Matt Barnes."
"A lot of athletes are technically overweight or obese. A ""normal weight"" athlete would look smaller amongst their peers.   Dudes like Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook are right on the cusp of normal weight and overweight. Aaron Donald is technically obese. The Rock is probably obese.   The thing about basketball is you don't want to be too heavy because it can fuck up your joints (particularly your knees) which of course shortens your career."
"I mean the headline claim is intentionally misleading, as the sole purpose for including the ""1"" bpg is to exclude Oscar Robertson (blocks werent recorded when he played) and Russell Westbrook who otherwise would have not only matched Lebron but surpassed him in everything but steals."
Russell Westbrook is technically overweight according to BMI lol
Elgin Baylor? Dude came off the train from not practicing to lead the league in scoring. Hes gotta have some unique raw talent to use.   I would also settle to be like. . Russell Westbrook athletic
What are you talking about? Jordan Clarkson is miles ahead of Russell Westbrook alphabetically
"Seriously? I get you’re being satirical, but I think everyone would agree that Russell Westbrook is better than Jordan Clarkson."

* Sour Milk - Russell Westbrook
"Russell was also only a replacement from the Eastern conference. He still has to compete for that last spot since there are plenty of all-star caliber guards in the west with Curry, Harden, Westbrook, Lillard, DeRozan, Holiday, Mitchell, etc."
I’ve only been watching since 2012 but from what I’ve seen it has to be Russell Westbrook. That guy plays every game like it’s game 7.
"- He’s only a 1x all star, which was 6 years ago  - Averaged at least 20 ppg only ONCE in his career  - Shot just 32% from 3 last season (Lower than Lonzo Ball)  - Has only been to the playoffs 4 times in his 10 year career  A lot of people on this sub said they’d rather have him over Russell Westbrook and Kyrie Irving which is just crazy."
"Russell Westbrook is a basketball god with absolutely no flaws and nothing you or stats or any sort of evidence says can disprove this. Never winning a title with Durant? It's everybody else's fault. Losing in the first round with All NBA Oladipo, everybody else's fault. Losing two years in a row in the first round with top 10 player Paul George? Everybody else's fault. This man is the greatest NBA player ever and y'all are haters"
MVP Russell Westbrook? You dumb
"Do you really understand the sheer amount of hyperbole in that statement   There was an NBA that didn't have a 3 pt line just a bunch of long 2s. Now perhaps you meant in the modern era of the NBA but even then there have been so many god awful scorers. Now if you are saying he is inefficient scorer by modern day NBA all star standards you might have an argument    There has been, is and will be far worse scorers than Russell Westbrook in the NBA"
Russell Westbrook? Giannis?
"Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Charles Barkley"
"Tough talk from a dude who had Russell Westbrook, James Harden and prime Serge Ibaka on his team and still only managed to make it to the Finals once. Good luck with Kyrie ""flat Earth"" Irving and Caris Levert."

"Yea, KD saying this doesn't change the irresponsibility of the Warriors staff when u just look at common sense and factual rationale  KD has said a lot of things in the past, not necessarily saying he's a liar but if one thing's for certain it's that he may feel one way one day...and then the complete opposite later on.  This is the same guy that got on a podium, and while he was crying, referred to Russell Westbrook as a ""brother"" to him that he'd ""run through a wall for"". But then after he left OKC he said him and Westbrook were never really close or friends"

"If Houston plays Golden State again in the postseason, I fully expect them to play some of the most aggressive and physical basketball we’ve seen this decade. They are tired of losing to them and I think they are the team’s biggest mental hurdle.  I’m still not sure about their chances against them, even now. The top 10 players in the series are something like Harden, Curry, Westbrook, Klay, Draymond, Russell, Capela, Gordon, Tucker, and Looney.  The 1st/2nd and 3rd/4th best players on the list are pretty even and Looney/Draymond destroyed Capela this past year. It will still be close."
"All time chuckers: Russell Westbrook, Micheal Ray Richardson, Josh Smith, Charles Barkley, Antoine Walker  All time crazy shot makers: Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, JR Smith, Marco Belinelli, Dirk Nowitzki"
I'm pretty stoked for GSW without KD's ball stopping and watching some legit off-ball Russell Westbrook in Houston this year.
"&gt; The ceiling of the KD/Russ Thunder was always a game or two short of a championship  I don't think you understand what ceiling means lol  Russell Westbrook was drafted in 2008. Since he was drafted, the Lakers, Mavericks, Thunder, Spurs, and Warriors have been the only team to make the finals out of the West. That's just 5 teams out of 15. And the Thunder were literally 1 game away from making the finals a second time, losing in 3 single-digit games.  The KD/Russ combo were always championship contenders. That was their *ceiling*, aka the highest possible point they could reasonably achieve. Just because they fell short doesn't mean that wasn't their ceiling, it just means they didn't reach their ceiling."
Russell Westbrook blew a 3-1 lead to a 73 win team and then joined them in free agency?
Any Russell Westbrook game
Bill Russell not Russell Westbrook smh

"Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Serge Ibaka, and Robert Swift."
Russell Westbrook
"Noted ballhog Russell Westbrook leading the league in assists over the course of a decade, no big deal.  Oh, right.  He stat-padded them all, obviously."
"I struggle putting Harden in First Team - He's been excellent the past 3 years, but Wade won in 2012 and 2013, made finals in 2014 - and has since contributed decently.  Curry/Wade/Lebron/Durant/AD  Then there's PG - this dude was battling against LeBron in the East for how many years, has had some DPOY votes and MVP votes and has sure has hell done more since 2010 then most other Small Forwards around.  Paul/Harden/PG/Kawhi/M Gasol  Then...  Russell Westbrook/Bryant (1st team in the 00s)/Griffin/TD (1st team in the 00s)/DMC   Sorry Mike Conley....."
"Who’s the center? They got two guards, 3 forwards on that 1st team. Here’s my teams going by position:  PG: Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook SG: James Harden, Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant SF: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George PF: LeBron James, Dirk Nowitzki, Blake Griffin C: Dwight Howard, Anthony Davis, Pau Gasol"
That's true of Russell Westbrook too. What position does he play?
"In regards to your 3rd question, there should be a lot of interesting teams next year! Historically, the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics are probably the most notable teams to follow due to their history of greatness and their famous rivalry. The Lakers have high expectations next year with Lebron James and Anthony Davis so they should be fun to watch. The Celtics probably won't be as good as them but they brought in All Star guard Kemba Walker and have a couple promising talented youths in Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.  The Warriors have been the best team for the last 5 years so they're eventually going to fall from grace but they should also be exciting to watch next year because Steph Curry has a chance to return to MVP form with more responsibility on his shoulders.   The Rockets will be interesting because they're now pairing MVPs James Harden and Russell Westbrook who both put up insane numbers.   The Milwaukee Bucks have Giannis Antetokoumpo who just won MVP so it could be interesting to see how far his team can go in the next couple years.   Also the Los Angeles Clippers brought in superstars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It should be fun to watch them battle the Lakers for the best team in LA.   Some other exciting playoffs teams worth following would be the Jazz, Nuggets, 76ers, Raptors, Pacers, and Blazers. There's also a lot of younger teams who are waiting for their young talents to really bud, like the Kings, Mavericks, Suns and Bulls so it could be fun to watch their young players frow into stars."
It's disrespectful to put Russell Westbrook on the 2nd team when he has arguably the greatest decade of individual stats. Switch Leonard with Russ and we're good.      [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_career\_achievements\_by\_Russell\_Westbrook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_career_achievements_by_Russell_Westbrook)
"Just out of curiosity, I summed up the cumulative MVP shares over the past 10 seasons:  -  **1st Team:**  1\. LeBron James (5.979)  2\. James Harden (3.291)  3\. Kevin Durant (3.209)  4\. Stephen Curry (2.206)  5\. Russell Westbrook (1.614)  -  **2nd Team:**  6\. Kobe Bryant (1.284)  7\. Giannis Antetokounmpo (1.013)  8\. Kawhi Leonard (0.993)  9\. Derrick Rose (0.981)  10\. Dwight Howard (0.931)  -  **3rd Team:**  11\. Chris Paul (0.772)  12\. Anthony Davis (0.599)  13\. Carmelo Anthony (0.449)  14\. Paul George (0.378)  15\. Tony Parker (0.364)  -  **Next up:**  16\.

12 months from now - \[Kobe Bryant\]: The Rockets can not wi with Russell Westbrook dominating the ball.
"37 Points in 14 minutes = 2.64 points per minute, while sharing the court with the likes of Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, KD, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, James Harden, etc.  Olympic Melo was actually the human torch."
How about if Russell Westbrook dominates the ball instead
"Russell Westbrook is actually a half decent shooter, he just takes a BUUUUUNCH of his 3s out of rhythm. It wouldn't surprise me if he shot between 35 and 37 percent in Houston next year if he works on WHEN to take his shots within their system."
Pulled a Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook&gt;Ray Allen&gt;Dwayne Wade&gt;Reggie Miller&gt;Clyde Drexler
"Yeah I agree.  I kust think its important to recognize that in apite of that, they traded him for Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook is the second best point in the league. Only behind steph because of his superior shooting
"I don't think Wilt is in the top 10, just as I don't think LeBron was inferior to Westbrook in 2016-2017 because I don't ascribe to the ""stats"" argument anymore than I ascribe to the ""rings"" argument (i.e. Robert Horry was not vastly superior to Malone, Stockton or Barkley). Yes, great players tend to have great stats, but great stats don't MAKE them great players.   You don't get better stats anywhere than the Harlem Globetrotters, and you can always find great stats from average players as long as they're the best player on their bad team.   You want the best players? Find me those players that dominated the game, AND that won all the titles, AND whom their peers called the best among them. I can think of few that fit that bill: Lebron James, Michael Jordan, and Bill Russell.   Bill Russell: 11/13 championships. 21-0 in elimination games. Got into Chamberlain's head- potentially the greatest athlete to play basketball- and outplayed him year after year after year.   Lebron: 4 MVPs    Jordan: 5 MVPs    Russell: 5 MVPs"
Russell Westbrook will learn how to share ball time on the Rockets
"Are you trying to find out what teams could have 5 guys on the court whose jersey numbers would be 4-2-0-6-9? I already did my research and determined that if the Rockets never waived Zhou Qi (9) and Chris Chiozza (2), then they could put them in the lineup with Danuel House (4), Russell Westbrook (0), and Gary Clark (6). That would do it."
One of the reasons why my view of Smush Parker was skewed as a kid was because he was pretty good in NBA Live. They had him as an athletic dunker so I played him like Russell Westbrook.
"Jazz are 2-1 in the first round in the last 3 years.  Wins over: Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Paul George. Sure not the biggest stars, but still stars.  People will realize soon that Gobert IS a star player, and Mitchell will be one soon."
"Russell Westbrook is the third nets player in the league, Kawhi is the most overrated player in the league, the player not named Lebron I would start a franchise with is Draymond Green"
"I fet that this is a harden thread. , im ready to get downvoted oblivion but i just cant comprehend how this is getting upvoted. Theres no way he would be Dirk.  After the craziest offseason in quite some time it seems almost everyone forgot who this rockets team is. They specifically came forward and stated they are designed to beat the KD warriors. One of the best teams of all time.  They literally brought everyone back except chris paul who was their weakness and UPGRADED into russell westbrook a walking triple double.    Barring injuries to bron or AD and unless boogie returns former self theirs no team thats beating them in 7 games."
Did you know Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for the third straight year last season and no one cared. The achievement wasn't that talked about.
Right lol fucking Paul George and Russell Westbrook couldn't make it out of the first round 2 years in a row what's a past prime Dirk going to do alone? It's a miracle he even made the playoffs at all past 2012
"James Harden is my first thought. Russell Westbrook as well. Some of those OKC teams were scary. Of course, both of them can fix that this year."
Idk?? Those things don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Also are you seriously implying that if you can’t shoot well then you’re a useless offensive player?? You?? A thunder fan that just watched a decade of Russell Westbrook??
I don’t get the whole narrative of “Miami being desperate”. Is it because of Pat Riley’s questionable contracts? We didn’t pull the trigger on Russell Westbrook or Chris Paul trades so we probably aren’t that desperate. The reason we didn’t do those trades is because it was reported we were setting our sights for 2021 (or waiting for an opportunity to trade for Beal).
"alright first time 2010-11 season, I was not dumb, I was happy Lebron left for his own benefit as im more of a player &gt; franchise, unless if the player completely fucks over the franchise and it was done out of pettiness (mr Kevin) even though ive come to accept Kevins decision as well, I knew that he deserved better and whatever we ever tried was just not good for him, he gave his all and I appreciate that, I hated everyone who burned his jersey because he legit took us to the finals and we still gave him no help... I really hate big z btw, always thought that man was trash, BUT ANYWAYS, the season was hard to even watch, just going on losing streaks was just bad and it gave me a depression as I would just get made fun of for it a lot. I ended up just stop watching the season until Kyrie (my favorite NBA player of all time) came to Cleveland as I started favoring college basketball heavily that season over watching my Cavs lose so many times. he grew and grew and it was just amazing. loved watching him so close up and getting to see him flourish as he already looked so NBA Ready in his rookie season. he was just one of those guys you know will just only grow (and he did)   &amp;#x200B;  2013, the news came to me, Lebron is back from Miami to Cleveland, I couldn't believe it... Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, AND NOW LEBRON (even though Kevin was kind of upsetting seeing him on pace to be a all time great to slowly declining in Cleveland to just a unanimous ""good big man"") the season was exciting we kept going and going, everything just falling place, it took us obviously a couple of years to get where we got so imma just skip all the boring stuff and go straight to 2016. (even though 2015 was a great season, we will not talk about it) Lebron Kyrie and Kevin all now with great chemistry and teamwork as we see on Richard Jeffersons snapchat Story everyday. The team is looking GREAT, we are genuine contenders and we have the keys to littearly win the finals after DOMINATING, the hawks so bad they went into rebuilding mode, the Celtics to another level of disrespect, our rivals the bulls, and obviously the infamous lebronto... its just great dominating, feeling a lick of the championship, but were still not there yet, we defeat everyone in our way in 2016 playoffs WITH EASE, I remember certain shots and everything from each series, wether it was raptors, pistons, or hawks, it was just funny to see them losing and us winning so easily it just looked nic- game 1... 89 - 104 against the warriors, its not super bad but thats still a 15 point loss but its ok its just one gam- game 2... A 33 POINT LOSS, ABSOLUTELY DEVESTATING YEA SURE OK WE GET IT GS YOU ARE 73-9 YOU CAME BACK FROM 3-1 TO KEVIN DURANT AND RUSSELL WESTBROOK BUT THIS IS JUST NOT FAIR PLEASE STO- game 3... we beat them by 30... ok this was home, we won by 30, we are easily going to tie the series 2-2 in game 4, thank go- game 4 AT HOME and we lose, the only thoughts in my head, boy oh boy I cant wait til 2017 to get these fucking shitheads I swear they wont repeat, basically I really thought we lost right then and there, a lot of people did and its embarrassing to admit it but thats because I am willing to admit what many Cavs fans wont, we gave up, but ooooooohh just wait til you hear about game 5... game 5 KYRIE AND LEBRON GO OFF FOR 82 MOST POINTS BY A DUO IN NBA HISTORY IN THE FINALS, I just got an INSTANT Rush after that game, play by play going in hard sooo so hard, I loved it. Game 6... Super scary entering this game, we are at home court and if we lose, we are going to be so embarrassed losing the finals at our own home court, but w ended up picking up the win and it was so so anxiety filling cause all it was doing is teasing and teasing and teasing. We win the game by 14 points but even that is a nail biter, as 14 points is the least we need to feel safe against this RECORD SEASON team. We get to oracle arena in game 7 and when I open the tv to see Kyrie and LeBron wearing those same jerseys from game 5, omg I felt so excited, I loved those jerseys so much and its my all time favorite jersey, it holds history and its just purely really sexy lmaooo. but the first quarter is just so neck and neck and both teams are playing super aggressive with it, second quarter we get DOMINATED, im super quiet and dont know what to say, my warriors neighbors are celebrating every warriors point and booing every Cavs possession, (I live in California). third quarter we come back HUGE on points and we are playing really great out there, everything from LeBron getting assists to the open man, to fastbreaks happening so often (where most of our points are coming from), the defense look somewhat ok but somehow no one can stop draymond??!!?!? but still an effective Cavs third quarter, the 4th quarter was the longest 4th quarter I have ever watched, then it happened. Igoudala to curry back to igoudala, up for the layUP- OH BLOCKED BY JAMES! That block gave me AND STILL DOES give me goosebumps every single time. Ive seen LeBron do it many times before and ive see nlebron do it so many times after, but that one, omg that one right there was just too solid to ever forget about. That was the greatest thing ive ever witnessed in the history of the NB- the crowd chants ""defense \*clap clap\* defense \*clap clap\*"" ""Irving and Curry one on one, Irving PUTS IT UP, ITS GOOD, KYRIE IRVING FROM DOWNTOWN"" I WENT ABSOLUTELY BESERK SEEING THAT SHOT GO IN SO SMOOTHLY MADE MY HEART DROP AND SAY OMG THERE NEEDS TO BE A MIRACLE FOR THEM TO EVEN COME BACK AFTER THIS... The game ends and I fall into tears just as LeBron did, im so excited ive never cried over something equivalent to this. The whole city of Cleveland and basically all of Ohio erupted and it was great to see it all just unfold like that, I sat back in my couch relieved and excited at the same time, watching everyone just celebrate, LeBron holding that trophy (both of them), ""Cleveland this is for you!!!!!!"" ahh love it.  2017 that summer after the chip KD joins obvi the warriors and its a complete blow off if youre a Cavs fan, obviously very worrying, but man oh man we had confidence, we go through again destroying the east, disrepsticng the pacers, lebronto, and the Celtics with ease. but come the warriors time, we lose and go down 3-0 and after that one game that brought us back to 3-1 it was super unrealistic but many fans pretty much had that ""if we can do it once we can do it again"" and we honestly had a better structured team that year anyways, but you know things dont always go as planned. 4-1 we lose, we lose kyrie (personally devastating even though the drama idc I love kyrie)   2018 season happens, almost lose to Celtics but you know.. LeBron and stuff. Game 1 of 2018 happens, that was just demoralizing... it was just over from right there. that was our chance of momentum and it was gone. Always loved jr off court but on I hated him, even with good games, still never liked him. but its whatever.   now were here, in 2020 where the warriors are the worst team in the league? (not their fault) the Cavs are just as good/bad? the raptors are champions, LeBron is still the best player in the world but only certain occasions where he wants to show it basically cuz we've come to expect him to have inhumane numbers because thats the standard he has set for himself but obviously LeBron is a genius and is still playing amazing while preserving himself just putting himself as the second best player in the world behind kawhi and the Cavs are just here at the bottom with a dying Kevin and every fans favorite duo in Collin and Darius or waht we call in the Cavs sub... sexland!  but yeah we alright now, we had our fun (both teams) and now the suns are doing not bad, the nba will always facisnate me..."
Why is this being upvoted? It is an absolute unspoken rule in the NBA. The only &gt;3rd seed MVP in the past 40 years was Russell Westbrook in 2017 simply because of A. A historic season and B. The Triple-Doubles. I’d argue Harden deserved it that year. Doncic will not get MVP without winning.
"Russell 'Negative +/- but better than Doncic"" Westbrook"
Or Russell “+40”  Westbrook
"Just off the top of my head you have:  Curry, Draymond, Iggy, Klay, KD  Jokic, Murray, Harris, Millsap  Lillard, McCollum, Nurkic  Harden, CP3, Capela, Gordon, Tucker (really the lynchpin of the Rocket's top tier defense)  Gobert, Mitchell, Ingles  Westbrook, George  DeRozan, Aldridge, Murray  Lou Williams, Trez Harrell, SGA, Beverly, Gallo  Fox, Hield  LeBron, Ingram (beast so far this year)  KAT  Gasol, Conley  AD, Jrue, Randle  Luka  Booker, Ayton  Giannis, Middleton, Lopez, Bledsoe, Brogdon  Leonard, Lowry, Siakam, FVV, Danny Green, OG  Embiid, Reddick, Simmons, Harris, Butler  Irving, Hortford, Hayward, Tatum, Brown, Smart  Oladipo, Turner, Bogdonavic, Sabonis  Russell, LaVert, Dinwiddie, Harris, Allen  Vuc, Gordon  Griffen, Drummond  Kemba  Richardson, Bam, Winslow  Beal  Young, Collins  LaVine, Markkanin   Love  Porzingis, Robinson   That makes 100. EZ. For the record every ranking list I could find puts Wiggins outside the top 100, so it's not like this is a hot take."
"The west is stacked... But Durant leaving, Curry being out, Thompson being out, leaves a little opening but idk cause   LeBron, Kawhi, AD, Jokic, Towns, Lamarcus  Make up the front court and if PG comes back then add him too.  If you try to put him in the backcourt   Caruso, jk   It would be Dame, Harden, Westbrook, Luka all locks  If curry comes back that’s another player   And I think you have to consider Booker a near lock at this point   So that leaves a couple spots available to players like  Ingram, DJ, Jamal, Russell, Wiggins(if he keeps playing the way he has),"
"You're a fanboy. Let the kid lead teams to playoff victories before you say ""Ayton will never be as good as him."" I don't even see Doncic being as talented as young Dirk was.   A player who was called soft playing in a more physical and defensive league.   Dirk consistently led the Mavericks to 50+ win seasons and deep postseason runs in a tougher Western conference than what we have now.   Luka hasn't done anything, but put up STATS mostly against terrible teams as the number one option in a run and gun league that saw Russell Westbrook average a triple double for two straight seasons.   Like we are meant to believe the talent level in the NBA jumped that far forward in 5 years?   Even mentally unstable Markelle Fultz is the youngest player in NBA history with a triple double."
I just wanted to point out that I like how Coby White looks. Even if he’s currently missing shots and just not looking too great. I like how his confidence never wavers and he keeps on shooting and attacking.   If/When he figures it out he’s going to be very special. Love watching him play.   Obviously shoutout to James Harden and Russell Westbrook for picking it the fuck up after their slow starts. Harden once again put on a show.   Overall this game was pretty solid to watch as a Harden supporter and someone who never watched the Bulls. Wish success to both teams.
Russell Westbrook still exists
By that logic James Harden and Russell Westbrook are not superstars.
I still feel like CP3 will always be better than Russell Westbrook!!!
The same can be applied to how Rockets fans treat Russell Westbrook
"Exactly. Making the shots matters for the points you get from doing so, of course, but mainly just having guys out there that the defense feels they need to defend is just as important, as that impacts how your whole offense runs on every single play. It's why Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook are potentially such offensive detriments, because teams either assume they'll never take those shots or actually *want* them to, and they adjust their defense accordingly. Teams don't want to leave any of the Lakers' shooters wide open and dare them to shoot open 3s, so they're forced to scramble to contest if the ball swings to them."
If Russell Westbrook can get traded Dame can sure as hell get traded or leave in a few years. This league is unpredictable
This is the shortest argument EVER. Harden was way fucking better on offence than anybody else in the NBA including Giannis.    The only reason anybody gives a single flying fuck about defense is because people hate james harden.   Where was all this two way player talk when any of these guys won MVP?  Steph Curry. TWICE  Steve Nash TWICE  James Harden   Allen Iverson  Russel Westbrook     Hell let’s look at the top 2 contenders between 2015 and 2019  2015- James Harden and Steph Curry (both obviously notes defensive beats)  2016 - Just Steph Curry was a contender for MVP because it’s largely considered one of the best seasons ever. Obviously his lock down defense was part of the reason why  2017- Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Everybody was obviously so impressed by their two way ability)   2018- James Harden and LeBron James. - I’m gonna stop playing around this time but you get the point. Another year where the top 2 mvp candidates played trash defense  2019 - Giannis and Harden. Harden puts up the best offensive stats maybe ever while taking a less talented team and more injured team in the western conference to just 5 less wins than Giannis. Harden also had **BY FAR** the best defensive season of his career that year and yet people just hate harden and decided to create a new narrative to not give him the award
Lmfao at thinking Russell Westbrook is better than Curry
"&gt; James Harden had a young Kevin Durant, young Russell Westbrook, and a solid supporting cast.   All three of these guys were way too young. Harden wasn't at his prime at this point.  &gt; outside of Golden state, the most dangerous shooting team in the NBA.   You answered your own question about Harden not winning a championship in the last couple years. Kawhi never beat a healthy Warriors or came close to what Harden did against them."
"Ok so Kawhi played on a spurs team that had a nearly retired Tim Duncan, old Manu Ginobili, and Declining Tony Parker. Then on the Raptors he had Kyle Lowry, an up and coming Pascal Siakam, and a solid bench lead by Fred VanVleet.   James Harden had a young Kevin Durant, young Russell Westbrook,  and a solid supporting cast. Then on the rockets he had Chris Paul and outside of Golden state, the most dangerous shooting team in the NBA.   Maybe Kawhi hasn't been on sub par teams, but Harden hasn't been on scrub teams that cannot go all the way. What he has is good coaches. Ever since they both became all stars one thing remains true when they are relatively healthy till the end of the season, and that is that Kawhi's team's do better than they are projected while Harden's team's are seen as failures compared to their projections."
"Luka ""Slovenian Westbrook"" Doncic? Or is it Russell ""American Doncic"" Westbrook?"
"Oooookay, lets do this.   In the 2018-19 season. . .   In terms of time per possession players possessed the ball, James Harden led the league with 9.3 minutes.   Rounding out the rest of the top five was Wall, Lillard, Westbrook, and Walker. Rounding out the top fifteen? Trae Young; Mike Conley; Chris Paul; Luka Doncic; Ben Simmons; D'angelo Russell; Lebron James; Jeff Teague; DJ Augustin; Devin Booker....  So, are you telling me, a guy who doesn't even rank in the top 15 in time of possession, SOMEHOW, is preventing a single teammate from averaging 20ppg?"
Russell Westbrook is half the player Kobe Bryant was.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-jordan-says-russell-westbrook-reminds-him-of-his-younger-self/amp/  Really? You think I just made that up? That’s a quote people have known about for a while  Age and endurance is part of athleticism.  Kobe was more of a ball hog though and plenty selfish. To me it seems a bit absurd to say Westbrook is MORE similar to AI than Kobe but we will just have to agree to disagree on that one
"&gt;Do you honestly think D Rose was a bad defender? He had 4.8 defensive win shares that season lol.  The Bulls also were 7.4 points per 100 better defensively with Rose off the court, and his DPBM was 0.1.  He was a mediocre defender on a great defensive team.    I'm not shitting on D-Rose.  Because people love(d) Rose, and because he fell off so quickly they deify his 2011 season, and I'm pushing back against that.  [Rose was a slightly better Westbrook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1=westbru01&amp;y1=2011&amp;player_id2_hint=Derrick+Rose&amp;player_id2_select=Derrick+Rose&amp;player_id2=rosede01&amp;y2=2011) that was somewhere in the 5-10 range of best players that year ([ESPN ranked him #8](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarank2011top10/path-nbarank-top-10-2011-now))."
the russell westbrook of centers?
yo fam did u just say you wanted Dante Exum or Russell Westbrook defensively over Marcus Smart?   what kind of meth are you on
They made one for Russell Westbrook too but he chose to wear a garbage bag for a shirt and a raccoon anus as a hat.
"Russell ""Raine Maida"" Westbrook"
"At this point I have no idea what you're talking about. Both decisions weren't the same because the circumstances of their decisions weren't the same.  LeBron didn't join a 73-win team.  LeBron didn't join the team he choked to the previous season.  The team KD left had Russell Westbrook, Ibaka, Adams, etc. The team LeBron left had Mo Williams and the corpse of Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Shaq.  LeBron didn't join a ready-made championship team. KD did.  LeBron's move did not unbalance the NBA; KD's did.  You can ignore all these facts if you like, but at least have the balls to acknowledge it."
Last year Russell Westbrook took 411 threes at 29%
"This is absurd. Of course the fact that he ultimately answers the question is meaningful in a conversation about *his relationship with the media*. And oh man, you are getting hysterical. Whenever you are gently roasted do you get seriously offended because ""with every joke there's a bit of truth?""   Anyway, this back-and-forth is exhausting. The fact is that everything you ascribe to me is more true of yourself. I'm done and blocking you. If you want to make this argument that ""Kyle Lowry is just as mean to the media as Russell Westbrook, only defensive homers can't see that"" in the future, maybe find a better example than a video where he is kidding around right before giving them the sincere quote they wanted."
"It seems like you are being *unintentionally* obtuse. Lowry has never systematically ""next questioned"" a specific reporter and there's no story on him like Molly Knight's on Russell Westbrook. It *is* drastically different. Again, this is a video of him *gently teasing* the media, and it cuts off before he seriously answers the question and gives the reporter the quote he was after."
"""The behavior is almost identical actually"" is fundamentally incorrect. Russell Westbrook is abrasive to and dismissive of the media in a way that doesn't compare to Lowry, who is occasionally prickly, but mostly cooperative. Again, this is a video of him *making a joke.* He may be irritated with the media at times, but he's not actually ""clearly being serious about this joke"", and again, we know that, because he gives his ""clearly being serious"" answer right after."
"Really? Because I dont see a single comment comparing this to Westbrook except for mine which I made after yours...  I think its weird that there arent MORE comments drawing the comparison because the behavior is almost identical actually. Sure maybe he answered the question sincerely but he was clearly being serious about this joke and combined with him leaving press conferences when he feels like and that video of him rudely watching another game during his interview its hard to really act like the behavior is all that different. Westbrook is a bit more direct and abrasive about it while Lowry is passive aggressive but the message is the same The difference is r/nba just hates Russell Westbrook.  FWIW I dont knock either of them for it, I think players have every right to not want to put up with the bullshit from the media."
&gt;Have a friend sprint to halfcourt at the same time you throw a ball to halfcourt and see which one makes it there first.  Put Russell at baseline sprinting to halfcourt with me and another defender guarding your inbounds pass and I guarantee Russell Westbrook gets to the halfcourt line before you get a clean pass to a teammate who even then still has to dribble to the halfcourt line.
"Every single time, and we see it a lot because its always about some random stat and ""Russell Westbrook"" and ""stats"" go hand in hand, he's tied to so many of them"
As a Russell Westbrook fan I am not one of those.
"Bunch of weird comments in this thread acting like Lowry is Russell Westbrook or something. After he makes this joke, he proceeds to answer the question sincerely."
"Just in case you're not trolling, elite rebounding guard Russell Westbrook left the Thunder for the Rockets. That will probably explain a) why Rockets' big man's (Capela's) individual rebounding opportunities have reduced slightly while the team's overall rebounding has improved, and b) why the Thunder's big man's (Adams's) individual rebounding opportunities have increased slightly while the team's overall rebounding performance has gotten worse.  (The reason why your post has gained so much traction is most likely because Adams was famous for boxing out opponent bigs so Westbrook could snag a few easy boards, and now that he's over at the Rockets, Adams is free to snag those boards for himself. People like making fun of Russ for 'stat padding' rebounds in this manner to get triple doubles. I personally think he's still the best rebounding guard in history regardless, but peoples' mileage on this topic vary a lot.)  But i think it's much too early in the season to draw conclusions lol, it's only been 8 games"
I can point you to Russell Westbrook winning MVP in his triple double average season (first time around) and a ton of Houston fans will agree with me that he won in that year due to narrative because he didn't have a top seed team.   I agree that he has reverted to going into cruise control many times while in the East and turning it on in the playoffs. I still think that he should have won finals MVP when he lost his first series against GSW and be the first person since Jerry West to win that award while on the squad that lost the finals.
"Yeah, Russell Westbrook definitely shouldn't have won it that year, even with the historic season.  Voter fatigue tho, can't expect Curry to get another MVP trophy, you know, so might as well go with the best player not on a top team."
"A quick look at AST%/TOV% from last year indicates that JRue, Luka and Giannis have a little way to go and Lonzo (3rd highest TOV% and by far the worst AST%) does not belong:  PLAYER | AST% | TOV% :--|:--|:-- Russell Westbrook|46.5|16.3 Trae Young|40.5|17.6 James Harden|39.5|14.5 LeBron James|39.4|13.3 Chris Paul|39.3|15.8 Nikola Jokić|37|15.4 Rajon Rondo|35.5|22.1 Ben Simmons|34.2|19.3 Jrue Holiday|31.8|14.1 Luka Dončić|31.6|15 Giannis Antetokounmpo|30.3|14.8 Lonzo Ball|23.8|17.8  By these metrics the two strongest missing candidates for ""elite"" playmaking are:  De'Angelo Russell: 7 ast/g, 3 tov/g, 41 AST%, 14 TOV%  John Wall: 9ast/g, 4 tov/g, 39 AST%, 16 TOV%."

Russell Westbrook slept with my wife.
"Right on : Russell Westbrook. I was behind the pick that people thought was a reach. I did think he would be a much better defender.  Wrong on : JJ Reddick. - I said he would be Rookie of the year. Wrong on: Jabari Parker. Thought he would be execellent.  BONUS. As A Thunder fan, I predicted Harden would struggle when he was traded to Houston."
"&gt; Lance Stephenson led the league in triple doubles with 5 just 6 years ago  Since then we've had 3 triple-double *seasons* from Russell Westbrook  Its just insane, even the ""supposedly"" athletically-challenged Luka Doncic put up 2 triple-doubles in the space of 48hrs. And Lance Stephenson not too long ago was regarded as a triple-double threat for putting up 5 lmao"
"I mean I think a guy like Westbrook has traveling rules ingrained in his soul at this point. When he took his little dribbleless stroll that game I feel like he genuinely thought the ref wouldn’t call it. It’s a good game, I’m all alone in the backcourt and I’m Russell Westbrook I can for sure take 3 or 4 steps but what if I go for 7? I’m the best player in the league they wont call that shit on me (wasn’t that his mvp year or was it a year after? either way I’m sure a player of his caliber believes he is the best.) I doubt he forgot to dribble. Bledsoe over here though was operating on a different frequency lol I don’t know what happened to him."

"Russell ""Roller Coaster"" Westbrook"
HOW RUSSELL WESTBROOK REVERSED HISTORY
Russell Westbrook
Russell “Instant Offense” Westbrook
"""Fuck them Adults""  - Russell Westbrook"
“Fuck” - Russell Westbrook
"""*I almost scored on that layup...*"" - James Harden  ""*...*"" - Russell Westbrook"
i think anyone averaging a triple double is impressive irrespective of russell westbrook
"Russell Westbrook at 27.0%, so a combined 66.9% from those two.  Lakers duo is 31.9 and 31.8, for 63.7%  Kawhi and Lou at 28.8 for 67.8%. Curious how this will be with PG added in the mix. I think this is the top one.  It would be interesting to do these by teams, and compare that to records although it's too early for that now. Those 3 are just the most interesting to me. They're within 4% although I wonder about the Clippers. Brooklyn, Mavs, Portland are interesting too.  To me the Lakers look most sustainable and dangerous. They are top heavy but evenly split.   As the season goes on, I wonder if Rockets and Clippers will have similar breakdowns or not."
"The only reason Harden is sometimes listed as a shooting guard is because he’s taller than all our other guards. If you’re saying he can’t be a point guard because he’s taller then Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook, then you probably need to re-think the way you watch basketball."
"True still early in the season but it will happen and it's frustrating. GSW will be doing it, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, lots more to come."
"His best season ever, which was year 8, he averaged 21.9, 5.4 and 3.5 on 47% shooting.   But since you asked I would take all of the following players over Hayward without a second thought.  LeBron  AD  PG  Kawhi  Giannis  KD  Steph  Klay  Kyrie  Devon Booker  Harden   Russell Westbrook   Ben Simmons   Joel Embiid   Donovan Mitchell  KAT  Chris Paul   Damien Lillard  Jokic  Kemba   No GM or person would trade anyone on that list for Gordon Hayward and that’s not even getting into all the promising you guys who look like they have higher ceilings than Hayward ever did."
"&gt;You also get it because every opinion now gets labeled as either hate or fanboyism instead of being discussed for its substance.   Frankly no, you get it because you go out of your way to criticize at every possible chance.  And exaggeration would be saying:  &gt;The Divine Comedy of Russell Westbrook   &gt;Has Russell Westbrook Figured it out?  etc.  This isn't even people who are Westbrook fans saying it, it's everyone.  It's not a matter of labels for hate/fanboy, it's just how Nick has come off over his career.  Same as Skip.  Its not some deep labeling issue, it's actually how Nick comes off to people when he's ignored the positives and focused on the negatives for one single player while doing the inverse with many others.  That's the issue.  Fair analysis looks at good and bad, not just bad.  Last edit: Sorry man but if you really want further explanation seems I can't help. Maybe reply/ask someone else or start a topic so someone else can explain further.  I seem to not be getting the point across as to why people think this, and have thought it since a long time ago.  This hasn't been something that just came up, its been his thing for 6-7 years at least, but if you need further explanation not sure what I can do.  Peace."
"Do you not understand how ridiculous of a scenario this is? How would Westbrook play in this series? How do we know he can't play defense like that? How would the coaching affect him? How would Warriors defensive communication on the court affect him? How would the newfound spacing affect him? How would being a third option help with his energy that he may use on other places? This is such a bad hypothetical. Draymond is the perfect fit the Warriors and now we are debating his impact against a high usage guard (which they already have) that has NEVER even played anything similar to the Warriors offense. Even though the thread is about contenders and one man shows. Not every contender plays like the Warriors, and not every one man show plays like Russell Westbrook.  &amp;#x200B;  Such a guess and check type of scenario and its just weird that you guys are actually trying to put it into basketball terms."
"Well it depends how your team is constructed. Obviously if you're the Knicks or Hornets you'd wanna draft Russell Westbrook instead of Draymond Green. If you're a 2013-14 Warriors team and already have a first and second option, you take Draymond Green."
Its funny because Russell Westbrook is doing the same thing and no one is complaining....
"&gt; Paul George with rest isn't leading Toronto to a championship. &gt;  &gt; Demar DeRozan with rest wasn't leading Toronto to a championship. &gt;  &gt; Russell Westbrook with rest wasn't leading Toronto to a championship. &gt;  &gt; James harden with rest wasn't leading Toronto to a championship.  Then proceeds to mention  &gt;The facts are the facts  Did you really make up what you thought would happen under different circumstances and then follow it up with the line ""The facts are the facts""? And then of course went ahead and took it a step further by assuming who would, not could, have won with that team? Not even mentioning that the player you say would have won was one of the best players from the opposing team.  There's a good argument for both sides, but please get off your high horse thinking what you know is right and the opinions of others is automatically wrong because they do not align with yours since you ""know"" what would happen if you swapped those players with Kawhi."
James then went on to state that he would be adding Russell Westbrook to players he’d like to play with.

"&gt;trash  You just started watching basketball so I'll let it slide - but YSK that Gordon Hayward had a catastrophic ankle injury a couple seasons ago that he was rehabbing from and coming back from last season.  Welcome to watching the NBA! Hope you enjoy the Rockets this season. They have a couple great players in James Harden and Russell Westbrook- you should learn those names, they're a lot of fun."
"Well yes, but if anyone passes the eye test it's Russell Westbrook. It's stats that don't usually agree with him as much."
Russell Westbrook is not playing though.
"&gt; you don’t need some arbitrary amount of years being great to be better than somebody  Yes you do. That's ridiculous. Longevity is part of how good someone is. Under your theory Russell Westbrook is one of the best PG of all-time, I'd like to see you make that argument but I suspect you won't because it would mean your wrong..."
"I agree with you.  This man is acting like with load management , any superstar can come on a good team and avg 30.  As much fellating people do over kawhi, the people who diminshed what he's been able to do is equally if not more annoying.  I can see why people rate him a certain way, regency bias, looking for the next superstar  But I don't see why people would underrate what's he's been able to accomplish.  Paul George with rest isn't leading Toronto to a championship.   Demar DeRozan with rest wasn't leading Toronto to a championship.   Russell Westbrook with rest wasn't leading Toronto to a championship.  James harden with rest wasn't leading Toronto to a championship.   The facts are the facts. What made the run impressive because not only of his stats but the team followed his leadership. He was never rattled.   The only people you can put on the raptors with rest/load management that would have won is LeBron James and Kevin Durant. They are the only ones."
There are a lot of statistical articles about how Westbrook was better than KD their last season together in OKC. One was posted on here just the other day.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/
Of current players here’s where I have them in the Top 50: LeBron James #3 Stephen Curry #16 Kevin Durant #18 Kawhi Leonard #31 Chris Paul #32 James Harden #37 Russell Westbrook #43 Giannis Antetokounmpo #48
| Player | Year | PTS | REB | AST | |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| | Russell Westbrook | 2010-11 | 21.9 | 4.6 | 8.2 | | James Harden | 2010-11 | 12.2 | 3.1 | 2.1 |
" &gt;This is part of why you see Ingram, Westbrook, Russell with high PnR numbers and low Spot Up numbers. You do not see such numbers this year because Ingram has changed role a bit this season so far.  Jesus dude, you’re completely missing my point. 2.5 is not low. It’s also not high but you’re pretending like it’s “no opportunity.” And idk how many times I have to repeat this to you but I am not saying Ingram is being used the same way as last year.   &gt;I don't see the purpose of this bet. My argument is not that he will continue at this efficiency. But Spot Up is, in general, a more efficient play type than pick and roll ball handler. And hot shooting aside, shifting some of his offense to that action is likely helpful.  &gt;Even if he were to perform PnR ball handler and spot up both at league average efficiencies. Shifting some possessions from pnrb to spot up would have a positive effect on his scoring efficiency.   Uh, no shit. But it’s not Walton’s sole job to maximize Ingrams scoring efficiency, and Ingram scoring more efficiently does not mean he’s being used in the best way for the team. This is why I’m convinced you didn’t watch many Laker games last year. You haven’t disputed this so I’m assuming it’s true. Look at the personnel on the team after the Lebron injury. Deciding Ingram is best suited as a primary creator is a far from “awful” decision."
"I'm really not sure what you're missing.... primary initiators engage in other actions far more than they attack close outs. Attacking a close out requires some one else to have drawn your man off of you. This is part of why you see Ingram, Westbrook, Russell with high PnR numbers and low Spot Up numbers. You do not see such numbers because Ingram has changed role a bit this season so far.  I don't see the purpose of this bet. My argument is not that he will continue at this efficiency. But Spot Up is, in general, a more efficient play type than pick and roll ball handler. And hot shooting aside, shifting some of his offense to that action is likely helpful. *Especially* if he's increased his perimeter shooting threat (even if not to the insane degree that we've seen over only a few games).  Even if he were to perform PnR ball handler and spot up both at league average efficiencies. Shifting some possessions from pnrb to spot up would have a positive effect on his scoring efficiency."
"Yall need to stop, Lebron of course. Honorable mentions though Kyle Lowry, Al Horford, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Steph Curry, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook. I can defend each one."
"chris paul is better for the rockets than russell westbrook, who knew"
Probably a little less long than for people to admit the last two seasons of Russell Westbrook shooting the basketball actually happened.
"but is the most athletic in the league? Zach Lavine, Russell Westbrook, Andrew Wiggins, Zion Williamson, even De Aaron Fox is in the 1% of athletes."
"Blake Griffin has average/below average length but he was an elite athlete, Rudy Gobert has a 7’9 wingspan and doesn’t look like he can jump over a piece of paper. Giannis has elite length and *dont kill me* a step below elite athleticism combined with strength. he’s fast relative to his size but doesn’t have some crazy vertical. he’s a physical freak. a guy like Russell Westbrook, Lebron James are athletic freaks. faster, stronger &amp; jump higher than everyone else"
https://mobile.twitter.com/kpelton/status/983423223567024128  &gt; I would caution against using box plus-minus to evaluate Nikola Jokic's defense because of the same issue that cropped up last year with Russell Westbrook. The assist% * rebound% term in BPM wasn't trained on players with as high a combination of the two skills as them.
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2017/04/05/russell-westbrooks-triple-double-domination-is-not-as-impressive-as-it-seems/  &gt; Westbrook contests 3.6 shots per game, the lowest rate of any player averaging at least 30 minutes per night. The players he guards attempt eight field goals per game, per Synergy Sports, which means they take more than half of their shots without any sort of defensive effort on Westbrook’s part despite him being the closest defender. Even his attempts to contest shots does little good: Opponents have a better field goal percentage on shots he defends (48.6 percent) than on all of their other field goal attempts combined during the regular season (45.2 percent)."
"https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/is-russell-westbrook-padding-his-rebounding-stats-by-leaving-his-defender-stats-say-he-is-01dmny0ph0z4  &gt; Is Russell Westbrook Padding His Rebounding Stats by Leaving His Defender? Stats Say He is  &gt; [...]  &gt; Westbrook has contested a grand total of 160 FG’s on the ENTIRE SEASON. That number is staggeringly low and to be frank, flat out embarrassing. … Westbrook ranks dead last in the NBA in contested shots among players averaging 30 or more MPG by a considerable margin."
"Lol see this is what happens when you look at the wrong stats without knowing what they're based on.  I *love* Westbrook and think he does a lot of things really well.  [Defense is not one of them](https://nbamath.com/russell-westbrooks-defense-is-finally-a-problem-for-the-oklahoma-city-thunder/).  In recent years he's rated as an average-to-below average defender by pretty much all adjusted +/- metrics.  And Drummond is more of the same.  For his career, DRAPM has him in the 29th percentile of centers defensively.  Here's a piece about [his](https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2017/9/28/16370980/andre-drummonds-issues-on-defense-run-deep) major defensive issues.  Those guys are the kind of guys BPM rewards - they get a lot of rebounds and they gamble for steals and blocks.  But playing good defense is more about making good rotations and putting in consistent effort, which BPM is formulaically incapable of capturing."
"Again, you're cherry picking.  You listed all the good players in the top 10 for DBPM last season but didn't mention that it also had Russell Westbrook and Andre Drummond in the top 10.  BPM only looks at the box score.  It gives you defensive credit for getting a lot of rebounds per minute.  It's not going to be an accurate tool for predicting how good a player is defensively.  538 switched from using BPM to RPM in its models a couple years ago because it found that BPM was a pretty lousy predictor of success, largely because it failed to pick up on defense:  &gt;Instead, BPM has trouble picking up on factors such as defense and team cohesion. That led CARMELO to overrate teams such as the Minnesota Timberwolves and underrate more defensive teams such as the San Antonio Spurs last year. If we’d run the numbers using RPM instead of BPM in 2016-17, our projections would have been above-average again as compared with the projection systems that APBRmetrics tracks, we discovered.  &gt;All of this stuff gets complicated, and discussions can quickly devolve into alphabet soup. But for better or worse, the choice of metric matters quite a lot. According to BPM, Russell Westbrook’s 2016-17 season was easily the greatest in NBA history. According to RPM, he was only the ninth-best player in the league last season."
Russell Westbrook has been doing better than CP3 in terms of scorings so yeah it’s a good move
"This is so great. After I saw a vid of the shitty stuff he does to pad his stats, I actually root for him to fail. Pleas post more Russell Westbrook lowlites. Include some of his horrible fashion too."

"This reminds me of that pullup 3 that KD had on LeBron in the finals where someone in the game thread said ""how do you stop that"" and the top response with a ton of awards said ""put him on a team with Russell Westbrook.""   Looks like it was maybe a little too true."
"Are you trying to diminish the value of a triple double to the team? No one is pointing to championship rings in this conversation. The thread title is ""Russell Westbrook finishes with a -46 against the Heat. Tied for the 4th lowest mark ever recorded."" which measures a player's efficiency.  If you want to get more specific here is the All Time list of PER  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/per_career.html"
Because people like you love to use the “boston fan” argument to further your point as us being horrible people because it was a snobby and racist city.   Definitely not gonna let a Utah fan who’s crowd makes Russell Westbrook feel like he’s Jackie Robinson gonna pull that on me

Maybe I'm confusing events? But that's the one I remember race being brought into  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/03/15/utah-jazz-owner-backs-russell-westbrook-tells-fans-we-are-not-racist-community/%3foutputType=amp
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/03/15/utah-jazz-owner-backs-russell-westbrook-tells-fans-we-are-not-racist-community/  It wasn't last year's story, it happened in the 2018 playoffs (the 'boy' incident, i mean)."
why is the 4th pick worthless? both russell westbrook and cp3 were picked 4
"No, go read what the draymond rating is, I’m saying he’s bad even for a guard. Russell westbrook is also bad"
"It’s one thing if it’s PJ Tucker or somebody like that, but Russell Westbrook? Come on man, show us why you’re worth 40M a year  Hint: It’s not your 3pt shot"
"https://youtu.be/aNyNo-6_FCw  1:25 mark. What was the context I was missing? He dives nowhere near the basketball...   I don't know what you're arguing, honestly. I like Russell Westbrook. I can entirely see how he can be abrasive, disrespectful, obnoxious, etc.  But Patrick Beverly is just a dirty player. How is this even debatable?  This is how he makes his money, by being tenacious and annoying. I just can't respect somebody who that willfully tries to injure other players. Even if, through a series of mental gymnastics manaveurs, you think he isn't doing it willfully... Is it criminally reckless at this point?"
The worst thing you can do to Russell Westbrook is make him panic. Dudes brain just shuts off when he’s scared his team will lose and does dumb shit. The only way to make make him play smart is his teammates need to be shooting lights out from 3.   Otherwise he’s gonna take it upon himself to win the game. It’s such a waste of his elite driving skills to be shooting so many threes. Hell he should be driving even more since his free throws actually go in at a good rate now.
"Dude they showed NONE of the context and cut to a live motion play, in slo-mo, halfway through the action already! Shitty attempt by ESPN to show only what looked most dramatic and *nothing* more.  I don't know if Bev was or wasn't going for the ball in that specific instance or not, how could we? But that 'clip' absolutely doesn't help shed any light on it whatsoever. Absolutely could have been a basketball play. Beverley DOES dive for loose balls and makes great hustle plays all the time, and that is a normal basketball play. It's not suddenly only dirty to dive for a loose ball if Russell Westbrook is going for it. The dude has a huge ass chip on his shoulder and takes everything personally even if it wasn't personal, you can't deny that.  And hell, you gonna just ignore in that same video Russ being the one swinging for the fences at Beverly's nuts?"
"Where did I say it was Beverley’s fault? I was more just referencing that that Thunder team was *really* good when healthy. Do I think Bev was a little reckless with that move? Yes, I do. Do I think he was intending to *hurt* Russ. No, I do not. I think it was more of a freak accident. But if you don’t think losing Russell Westbrook for the post season didn’t significantly impact the Thunder’s shot at winning a title, I don’t know what to tell you boss. The point you make about the coaches, while true, is another conversation entirely."
Russell Westbrook isn't a particularly high FG% shooter..so Bevs has a point.
"I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
True there are less opportunities to cut. I think the best thing for him to do is attack the gaps of the defense instead of settling for outside shots. But he wont because he's Russell Westbrook

"He took that shot when they were down 1 with 7 seconds to go, Paul George was coming off a rotation from the Harden doubleteam, he had plenty of time to drive and make something happen, which is his wheelhouse.   10/10 defending teams hope, wish and pray that Russell takes the three point shot where he's historically bad for someone that has shot as many threes as he had.   Unfortunately. unless someone gets through to Westbrook this is why Houston will  not win a championship with this team, because he will take that shot."
Russell Westbrook: Utah Jazz Fans Told Me 'to Get Down on My Knees Like You Used To'  The New York Times Russell Westbrook Says Utah Jazz Fan Made 'Racial' Taunt That Led to Confrontation  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/sports/russell-westbrook-utah-fan.html  Yeah okay Jan
"It’s like this every offseason  I’ll tell you what’ll happen rn, the rockets will lose in the playoffs with westbrook posting horrible shooting splits, for like 2 weeks it’ll be russell westbrick time on the sub, then by July 2020 were back to pretending he’s gonna magically become a average shooter or stop shooting"
He shouldn't. But he's Russell Westbrook so he'll probably get in over the another guard that deserves it more like Mitchell or Booker.
"*“Pat Bev trick y’all, man, like he playing defense. He don’t guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing.”*   - Russell Westbrook"
"This converted me from hating Harden to feeling sorry for him.  Wow the shit he has to deal with this year, playing against a stacked Clippers team with Kawhi, Paul George and Russell Westbrook all going for his throat"
"Even with Anthony Davis, 11 assists is god tier.  If you look through the season leaders, there are fewer players who have led the league in assists than there are players who have won MVPs. It is a stat dominated by all time great players like no other stat.  You will probably be surprised by what you're about to read.   Since 1982, the only players to lead the league in assists are:  Magic Johnson (4 times) Isiah Thomas (1) John Stockton (9) Mark Jackson (1) Rod Strickland (1) Jason Kidd (5) Andre Miller (1) Steve Nash (5) Chris Paul (4) Rajon Rondo (3) James Harden (1) Russell Westbrook (2)  That's 11 players in 37 years.  If you take out the guys who only won it once, you have just 6 players leading the league in assists over 32 of the last 37 seasons.  When you're in that elite 10+ assist per game territory, it is more about the passer and how they decide to play.   You can't discredit Lebron for this one. The Heat big 3 was arguably a better team, he just took a different role."
picture Russell Westbrook but 5 feet and 200 pounds more
Patrick Beverley is a better basketball player than Russell westbrook
" Russell Westbrook trick y'all, man, like he playing offense. He don't hit nothing, man. He just running around, doing nothing."
"i mean i probably would too, but your first reaction to 2 guys running right at you is going to be to throw it to the open guy.  after 30 or 40 games, i'm sure harden's brain will adjust to the open guy being 21% 3 point shooter russell westbrook and he'll just starting launching away."
&gt; he Utah Jazz and Larry H. Miller Group announced today a permanent ban of the fan who engaged in the inappropriate interaction with the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Russell Westbrook last night at Vivint Smart Home Arena. The ban is effective immediately and includes all arena events. The organization conducted an investigation through video review and eyewitness accounts. The ban is based on excessive and derogatory verbal abuse directed at a player during the game that violated the NBA Code of Conduct.  https://ksltv.com/409795/jazz-fan-permanently-banned-vivint-smart-home-arena/
It feels like Russell Westbrook was already missing clutch 3pts when VC played in his first game.
We found him. His name is Russell Westbrook
"hmmmm well in terms of rebounding we would be the best team in the league    from Russell ""trip doub"" westbrook to andre ""goat rebounder"" Drummond and u cant forgot about Carmelo ""fuxk out of here I got it""   we would be amazing in that department."
It is not asinine. We would be so much fucking better with Russell Westbrook than Danny Green.
Yea I'm done watching this guy throw up 3s when he has a wide open lane like ffs you are RUSSELL FUCKING WESTBROOK JUST DRIVE DUDE
Welcome to the Russell Westbrook experience
THE HORRIBLE SHOOTING OF RUSSELL WESTBROOK CONTINUES!
"Not at all. He plays in the much easier conference, has a better roster, but most importantly... does not have Russell Westbrook."
"Because he was doubled all night long, and has Westbrook on his team.   *No other player gets doubled even half as much as he does, and even worse, no other superstar has to deal with Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook trick yall
HERE COMES RUSSELL WESTBROOK
F\*\*\* James (Flop/cheat) Harden and F\*\*\* Russell (Brick) Westbrook...downvote me all you want...Clips da bad boys of the NBA...chea
Man Russell Westbrook trick y’all man
Russell Westbrook has to be one of the worst players in the NBA... he will not stop attempting 3 pointers even though he is literally the worst 3 point shooter of all time... he had *6 turnovers* and its just a routine night for him at this point....    He shot 9 for 21.... he played the worst defense of anyone on the floor... I hate that Harden has to put up with this.....
Russell Westbrook sucks ass hold that L
Watching Russell Westbrook all throughout this game made me physically ill.

"lol they literally send their 2 best defenders, kawhi and PG to double Harden. Those 3 are all out of the play. It's a free 4v3 against the 3 weaker defenders, with Russell Westbrook 1 of the 4, and Rockets still can't finish it."
"""Paul George watching Russell Westbrook dribble right by him for the third year in a row"""
As a rockets fan it’s so frustrating to watch Russell Westbrook chuck up threes like he’s been doing this season
Russell Westbrook is booty. It was a good season boys.
"Terrell Owens ran a 4.45 at the combine. The players that are comparable to LeBron's size that are renowned for their speed and athleticism run in the 4.5-4.6 range (see: Jadeveon Clowney, Khalil Mack, Von Miller, etc.). Shit, Calvin Johnson is the epitome of freak athleticism, and he ran a 4.35 while being 3 inches shorter and 20-30 lbs lighter than LeBron. When you factor in that extra height and athleticism, you'd need someone that's a further athletic deviation from the norm than fucking Megatron to run a 4.45. LeBron's a freak of an athlete, don't get me wrong, but he's not *quite* that much of a freak.  Shit, I'd be willing to bet money there are like 5 guys in the NBA tops that could run a faster 40 than 4.45, and those are virtually guaranteed to be point guards renowned for their athleticism (see: healthy John Wall, Russell Westbrook, etc.)."
"Luka.  Given LeBron and Giannis have better records than Harden *and we should all know by now that if your name isn’t Russell Westbrook you need a top seed to win MVP* the only real controversial one of the three is Luka, but it’s not like he’s lacking mind-bending stats right now either."
"Chris Paul is better than Russell Westbrook, and Houston should never have made that trade.  Chris Paul's injuries make it harder to rely on him, but if they are both healthy and on the court then give me Chris Paul. Westbrook will get slightly better basic bitch stats, but CP3 dominates him in every advanced stat.   The Rockets will never win in the playoffs with Westbrooks inefficient chucking bringing them down."
I live in Oklahoma City and have been to plenty of restaurants down town where I was told “Yeah James Harden/Kevin Durant/Serge Ibaka/Russell Westbrook just came in/left” and had no idea they came and went.  I saw Russell get food at a deli once and he had sunglasses and a hoodie on and I only knew it was him cuz he paid for everybody’s food in life after him and got into a brand new Range Rover when he left.  Russell Westbrook’s brother is fucking cancer though. I went to UCO with him and he used tell girls “I’m Westbrook’s brother” as the reason they should sleep with him. Lmaoooo
Except Russell Westbrook has proven he can get a bad team to 40 wins quite a few times
Considering how bad everyone keeps telling me Russell Westbrook is I don't see how harden can't be the number 1 choice.
"They didn't see him becoming an MVP and probably saw him as somewhat of a redundant fit with Westbrook.  They got back Martin, who they thought fit the same role as Harden &amp; loaded up on picks. You definitely get the sense that they made the decision to trade Harden before they started shopping him. The type of trade where the roster logistics seemingly check out until you look at the value going both ways in the trade.  The Magic did the same thing to Oladipo, only Elfrid Payton isn't Russell Westbrook &amp; they actually gave up a pick instead of getting one back."
Russell Westbrook?
Good for him. He still didn’t deserve to be getting paid as much as Russell Westbrook and Kevin freaking Durant in 2012 after putting together one of the worst Finals performances I’ve ever seen.
Russell Westbrook due to the fact he’s still a machine athletically speaking even at 30. Plus I’d also get the beard with him.
It got Russell Westbrook an MVP for a reason.  It's arbitrary but it's eye catching.
"You've convinced me, Russell Westbrook is mentally retarded. Sucks for him."
"This article is packed full of analysis in the context of a player being aged 20 and doing what Luka is doing (spoilers: it’s unprecedented).  If that’s too cherry-picked for some, here’s this:  &gt; The complete list of players ever to average 25, 7.5 and 7.5 over a single season looks like this: LeBron, Oscar Robertson (six times), Russell Westbrook (twice), Larry Bird, James Harden and Michael Jordan.   Luka is well above those averages, currently.   Also this:  &gt; Among the 28 seasons in NBA history in which a player has used at least 35 percent of his team’s possessions while on the floor, Dončić’s current 0.625 true shooting percentage is second-best."
"&gt; I played soccer primarily and it always amazes me how basketball players can't see the passing lanes and angles when they play  This is one of the reasons why I like D'Angelo Russell. He sees the game as a proper playmaker, and many times you can see him wait for a teammate to get past their defender to give them a through ball or get in the right position to receive it unguarded.  There's not many players with that kind of vision, and many high-assist players (Westbrook, for example) get lots of assists IMO because of how much they have the ball in their hands. Many of his passes are simple passes, or drive and dish."

"I thought is really obvious no one wants CP3's contract. They either had to throw in draft picks to get rid of him or trade for another trash contract player, which is Russell Westbrook."
1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. CP3 4. Vince Carter 5. Russell Westbrook 6. Kawhi 7. Gasol 8. Howard
24% from 3 on 5.5 attempts? My man doing his best Russell Westbrook impression.
"I hate talking about the MVP award this early because it's 50% stats and 50% narrative.   If Doncic has MVP caliber stats at the end of the season but Dallas is the 5-seed, then it doesn't matter. The MVP goes to a player on a 1-seed or 2-seed team. There have only been 2 exceptions in the past ~35 years: Michael Jordan averaging 35/5.5/5.9/3.2/1.6 and winning DPOY on the 3-seed Bulls in 1988, and Russell Westbrook averaging a triple double for the first time in 55 years and leading the league in points.    Doncic is only winning the MVP if he gets into a top 2 seed, and I very highly doubt that will happen."
"He's watched what happens to players who don't do that. LeBron and Russell Westbrook get hacked 80% of the time they drive, but don't get calls because they try and bulldoze through. Harden makes defenders pay for playing defense illegally."
"Wilt no question and by a super large margin.  He probably has 100 more than anyone else.

Harden had 22 last year alone."
"almost 10 extra possessions a game is the difference between 7 and 10 rebounds which would undoubtedly make their rebounding numbers similar. And the offensive numbers reflect the style of play more than the actual players. I mean in a prime Kobe year in the mid 2000’s he averages 31-5-5. Do you think a sophomore Luka is better just because the numbers say so? No his numbers, along with James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Nikola Jokic, hell even LeBron and everyone else who puts up triple doubles on the regular with high scoring has inflated numbers"
Paul George and Russell Westbrook...oh nvm
He's no Russell Westbrook.
Excuse me?? How is Russell Westbrook not a superstar?
might be the stupidest thing i’ve read today. Russell Westbrook isn’t a superstar? y’all just say anything at this point

"Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure.  Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play. That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luka Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luka Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luka does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luka Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero."
Isn't that the fan who flipped off Russell Westbrook in 2016? I'm almost positive it is.
just going for easy lay ups on breaks.  This is what makes me think Russell Westbrook is INSANE.
"""You miss all the 3s you don't SHOOT."" \~ Russell Westbrook"
"100% true. Anyone who thinks a bad 3-pt shooter just taking a lot of threes is automatically gonna open the floor up for their teammates need look no further than Russell Westbrook. Teams are actually designing their offenses around daring WB to shoot more 3s, and are doing this by sagging way off him and doubling on other Houston players.  If you're a terrible 3-pt shooter and you shoot a bunch of 3s, the only person that's gonna create space for is yourself."
Russell Westbrook?
At least Russell Westbrook is real about it. Those other dudes are fake as hell.
Russell Westbrook from like 2012-2017 got off the ground quicker and faster than any human I’ve ever seen
"If only Chris Paul could have been on the Thunder last year, they would have had the all-douche team of Chris Paul, Paul George and Russell Westbrook."
"&gt; I'm pretty sure Him, Luka, and Russell Westbrook are going to rack up a lot of triple doubles   How bold of you"
"The Celtics have rediscovered their biggest strength. Coming off a disappointing season marred by chemistry issues, they have surpassed even the most optimistic projections in the first month of the season. Boston is tied for the NBA’s best record (11-2) and owns the third-best net rating (plus-8.3). Even losing Gordon Hayward, who is out for the next month with a broken hand, hasn’t slowed the Celtics down much. The key has been empowering Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.  The two top-3 picks broke out in the 2018 playoffs, when Tatum was 20 and Brown was 21. Each averaged 18 points per game while leading the Celtics to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. But instead of getting a chance to build on that success last season, the return of Hayward and Kyrie Irving from injury pushed them into the background. There were too many cooks in the kitchen in Boston. Tatum was sixth on the team in touches (45.3 per game) while Brown moved to the bench and finished ninth (31.8). The duo played only 884 minutes together last season, tied for 16th most among two-man lineups on the Celtics.  This season has been a different story. Brown is back in the starting lineup and has played 224 minutes with Tatum in just 10 games. Tatum is second in touches (67.5) and Brown is fifth (47.2). The team’s top four players in touches last season (Kyrie, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris) are gone. Their replacements have accepted smaller roles in the offense, giving Brown and Tatum the opportunity to both average career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and free throw attempts.  The two wings are tied for fifth in net rating (plus-16.0) among all two-man units in the NBA that have played more than 200 minutes this season. Look at how they compare with the most high-profile Big Twos around the league:  Big Two Comparison  Jaylen Brown + Jayson Tatum  Minutes: 224   Net Rating: plus-16.0  LeBron James + Anthony Davis  Minutes: 297  Net Rating: plus-14.7  Giannis Antetokounmpo + Khris Middleton  Minutes: 217  Net Rating: plus-12.4  Joel Embiid + Ben Simmons  Minutes: 122  Net Rating: plus-11.5  James Harden + Russell Westbrook  Minutes: 276  Net Rating: plus-10.4  But being that dominant is about more than just getting more opportunities. Boston’s two young wings are doing more with them, too.  Brown has always been an elite athlete. Now his skill level and feel for the game are catching up with his physical tools. The biggest difference this season is his ballhandling. He doesn’t have to settle for as many jumpers, and can attack off the dribble and use his size (6-foot-7 and 223 pounds) to finish among the trees. Brown has gone from ranking in the 55th percentile of scorers when handling the ball in the pick-and-roll last season to the 81st percentile this season. The defense is sending more help his way, which makes it easier for him to set up his teammates. His assist rate has gone up while his turnover rate has gone down. Boston coach Brad Stevens can now run offense through Brown, and trust him to make good decisions.  Tatum, unlike Brown, came into the NBA with a polished offensive game. His growth has come from learning how to better use those skills. He became known for killing the flow of the offense by holding the ball and settling for long 2s, but playing like Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony never made sense for him. It’s more than just the difference in eras. Tatum doesn’t possess the all-world athleticism of Kobe or the sheer mass of Carmelo. He’s a wiry player at his best when using his size (6-foot-8 and 205 pounds) and shooting touch to shoot off movement and attack closeouts. Tatum is getting fewer post-ups this season and more shots off of dribble handoffs and off-ball screens, and he’s taking 2.4 more 3s per game than last season (up to 6.3) while cutting his percentage of shots taken between 16 feet and the 3-point line in half.  The NBA is a wing-dominated league, and few wing tandems can do as many things on both ends of the floor as the new and improved versions of Brown and Tatum. They can shoot 3s, attack the rim, defend multiple positions, and grab rebounds in traffic, a skill more important than ever for perimeter players. And they are two of only eight players under 6-foot-9 averaging at least 19 points and 7 rebounds per game this season. The other six? LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Pascal Siakam, Brandon Ingram, and Russell Westbrook.  Many NBA teams don’t have one wing with the size and athleticism of Tatum and Brown, much less two. Because of that, at least one has a mismatch in almost every game. According to NBA Advanced Stats, big men like Julius Randle, Dario Saric, and Nemanja Bjelica are among the most frequent defenders on Brown this season, while Tatum has spent a lot of time being guarded by undersized perimeter defenders like Bradley Beal and Kyle Lowry.  The beauty of building a team around long and athletic forwards like Tatum and Brown is that the mismatches rarely go both ways. There are a lot of players whom they can guard who can’t guard them. They have the speed to stay in front of smaller players on the perimeter and the size to hold their own against bigger players inside. The Celtics are interchangeable on defense, especially when Marcus Smart is playing with their two young wings. They can switch every screen across three positions and take turns on the best perimeter scorers on the opposing team.  Their perimeter length covers up for their lack of size upfront. For all the noise surrounding Kyrie’s departure, the biggest concern for Boston coming into the season wasn’t at point guard but at center, where it had to replace Al Horford and Aron Baynes. Enes Kanter started on opening night, but a knee injury opened a spot for Daniel Theis, a third-year big man from Germany. While he’s averaging only 6.4 points per game on 45.6 percent shooting, he’s a smart player who cleans the glass (7.2 rebounds per game), protects the rim (1.7 blocks), and is almost always in the right position on both ends of the floor. Theis is thriving despite being the smallest starting 5 (6-foot-8, 215 pounds) in the league.  The Celtics are this year’s closest thing to the spiritual heirs of the Warriors. They don’t have the same star power, but their key players all fit into similar roles. Kemba Walker, like Steph Curry, is a smaller guard who can bomb 3s and play on and off the ball, and they surround him with big wings who can defend multiple positions, space the floor, and create their own shot. Their best lineup, when everyone is healthy, doesn’t feature anyone above 6-foot-8: Kemba, Smart, Tatum, Brown, and Hayward.  Boston still has a lot of room to get better. Tatum, for as effective as he has been from 3 (37.8 percent) this season, has been in an epic shooting slump from 2-point range. He is second-to-last in 2-point field goal percentage (41.6) among the 54 players in the NBA averaging at least 10 attempts per game. He’s shooting only 47.8 percent within three feet of the rim, a massive decline from his first two seasons, when he shot 64.7 percent. While going to the rim more often has exposed some of his physical limitations in comparison to the league’s best players, the odds are that those percentages will normalize over time.  And even though Brown will probably never be a point forward, he can still improve as a passer. His assist-to-turnover ratio has gone from 1.07-to-1 to 1.44-to-1, and it could go even higher as he gets more comfortable as a playmaker. The growth he has shown in his first four seasons is encouraging. Brown came into the league with the same questions about his jumper and offensive polish that surrounded other überathletic wings like Justise Winslow and Stanley Johnson, and has answered them in ways his peers have yet to address.  Brown and Tatum are leading a legitimate youth movement in Boston. The Celtics have the least experienced roster in the NBA, with no one over 30. The team is getting contributions from rookies Grant Williams and Carsen Edwards, as well as second-year big man Robert Williams III. Stevens is still figuring out his rotation, going with as many as 11 players on any given night.  What Boston has done over the first month is not a fluke. This is a young team with a ton of depth and waves of athletes at every position. Instead of taking a step back after losing Kyrie and Horford, they are taking a step forward. The biggest question is not how they get through the regular season but how they match up in the playoffs with other elite teams in the East.  There are two 7-foot Leviathans standing in their way—Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid. The Celtics were steamrolled by Giannis in their second-round series last season, as he averaged 30.0 points on 58.5 percent shooting, 11.8 rebounds, and 6.0 assists over the last four games. And he has been even more dominant this season. A series against Embiid could expose the Celtics’ lack of size at center. Theis is much smaller than Horford and Baynes, who always gave the Sixers big man trouble last year. Boston may have to count on Robert Williams, who has shined in limited minutes, or hope they can go small and run Embiid off the floor.  The Celtics are a team of really good players, one that will need someone to make the leap to greatness in order to win a title. Tatum and Brown are still a long way from reaching the level of Giannis or Kawhi. The good news for Boston is that its young building blocks are only 21 and 23, respectively. Everyone may have jumped the gun on them last season. But the Celtics are now one of the best teams in the NBA—and the best version of this team is still a couple of years away."
Exactly how I feel. There are people who legitimately don’t understand Russell Westbrook is a hall of fame player because he hasn’t won. Championships are a way of shutting down stupid and simple arguments with an even stupider and simpler argument.

"new team, new system, new coach, etc.  give him time, he will settle in.  Russell Westbrook is incredible."
"Only person who seems to agree with me, and responds with some reason. Benching, trading or staggering him may very well be impossible.   *Just pisses me off watching Harden put on 17 straight points on opposing defenses, he's the hottest player on planet earth and in comes this fucking idiot for his bone-headed brick from 3 point land, Russell Westbrook."

"Speaking of this, LeBron is rumoured to be left-handed while shooting with his right, as he uses his left hand for most things outside of basketball, as is Russell Westbrook. Mike Conley is also rumoured to be a righty even though he shoots left, as evidenced when he does his floater and signs signatures and things like that"

Who would you rather have taking a 3: Draymond Green or Russell Westbrook?
I was a bigger Harden fan if anything man. I’m a lefty guard myself.   I was always torn between the two. If I had to pick one. Because I loved how KD for most part played the game the right way and was willing to be coached. But on the flip. I realllly obsessed over how fearless and aggressively Westbrook played and still does.   I admired Durant for his ability to want to be coached but yet loved Russ for the fact that he played the last possession of a game the same way he played the first possession. At 100%.   Just wish Russell has a medium where he would lean in and listen some times. 
"Here’s the plot twist. I’m probably Russ biggest fan.   I own all his shoes. I’ve got just about every jersey. I have his bobble heads. His posters, his slam magazine amongst a bunch of other shit.   I love what the guy brings but hate how erratic he is.   I’m critical of him because I’m a big enough fan to know that any team with a locked in Russell Westbrook is very hard to beat. Russell is not locked in and hasn’t been for most of his career. Yet he puts up a triple double. Amazing.   Imagine how good he’d be if he ditched chasing stats and just genuinely DOMINATED (more like the MVP year) and the last 1.5-2 years with KD.   "
Russell Westbrook is good at the sport of basketball.
Russell Westbrook but not because I fear him just because I hate the way he plays

russell westbrook without a doubt. fiercest competitor in the league
"I'm the same age as Steph and went to UCLA when we had Kevin Love, Russell Westbrook, Darren Collison, and Mbah a Mutte on the same team. We went to final 4's and a national championship, but despite all that, I remember the craze around Davidson's Cinderella team and Steph more than anything. It was amazing to see. "
&gt;	OKC Russell Westbrook flair  Of course
"He's shot 32% this season and Westbrook has shot 24%. Combining their 3P/#PA you get 27.4%. This gives an expected PPP similar to that of around a 40% look from 2, which you should easily be able to surpass given you have Russell and PG along with Adams"
"How about Russell Westbrook isn't a top ten player? Not even a top 5 pg imo. Id rather have Harden, Steph, Lillard, Kyrie, Chris Paul. Over him. I love his aggression and the way he takes it the rim, but he takes some awful shots down in the clutch as well as horrible decision making and he won't ever win a championship as the best player on a team. "

I ahve a top 3  1.  Russell Westbrook v nuggets his MVP year he hit that amazing 3 and got the triple double he needed  2. Kobe’s final game (fucking goose bumps)  3. The end of that Derrick Rose 50 point game this year when he was crying. Nothing in basketball has ever made me so happy honestly. Just to see someone who’s been through so much in his career do something like that.
Russell Westbrook is the greatest player in the league at stopping a possession
"I agree about T-Ferg tonight and a lot of nights recently (Dennis has been cheeks), but the rest is a no from me.  You cannot convince me that any other coach could get better offense out of this team. Like, other team's bad offensive players can, atbthe very least, hid a mid ranger. Look at our roster, you have Westbrook, Schroder, Diallo, Grant, Noel, Adams, Nader, and TLC who all need to be around the rim to be at their best. Who do you have to space the floor for them? Grant has been good as a shooter but a lot of that is because people don't respect him and leave off him. Then you have Abrines and PG. That's it. Those are our bombers from outside. Can't rely on anyone else to hit a 3 or even a middy. These players suck on offense.  Defensively I totally disagree. Billy coaches a fantastic defense. We neverngot exposed in the playoffs. Grant and Taj did a phenomenal job on Harden (relative to what you expect from a switch). We lost that series because if Russell wasn't scoring or serving up points on a platter for people, we couldn't score. We were like -12 or some rediculous number in the 8 minutes or so he wasn't playing.  Then Utah didn't kill us for any reason other than that Melo fucking blew. I think Mitchell was averaging more than 1 point per possession when isoing on Melo. And before you say Billy should have stopped that, he tried. We gameplanned to stop switching but Melo was being lazy as shit. That's why he and Adams got into it that one game. If we had Robes that series it probably would have been different."

Charles Barkley thinks Russell Westbrook takes ill advised 3 point attempts. 
Grant's wearing Jordan 12 'Russell Westbrook' hahahaha wholesome asf
He is a young Russell Westbrook
"LeBron James, Jimmy Butler, Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Draymond Green, Russell Westbrook"
It’s not better by a mile when you have Russell Westbrook running the offence and making decisions.
Someone once told me that Russell Westbrook shot 3’s “better than Kyrie” and I almost had a Red Sanford style heart attack. 
Prolly cuz he's averaging 10 points on Russell westbrook efficiency.
Those are Russell Westbrook numbers.
There's two kinds of people:those that believe OP randomly came into possession of these 2 stats and those who know he's spent an ungodly amount of time trying to find a stat that would say Russell Westbrook is shit at shooting threes 
You guys don't even have free press. Your government jails journalists. I'm sure the media and propaganda you receive is not even close to unbiased and I'm suppose to take your word that Kanter is more evil than Ergodan?   Kanter would stop at random fast food restaraunt in OKC sometimes and offer to buy the first 50 meals of anyone that came in and shit. He made funny cooking videos with Russell Westbrook. He loves pro wrestling. He's a goofball and he's not evil or a terrorist. This sounds like Turgolu's burner. Just enough insults to the current regime to not sound like a shill.
All I'm getting from this is that Russell Westbrook is going to win the championship five times. 
"More like [Luka ""Russell Westbrook"" Doncic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUfkqseN2N0)"

"I don’t know what’s more emasculating, the guy beside her just letting his gf snap a pic of another man looking the way she did  OR  Having Russell Westbrook tell a man in the front row “Just sit down with your wife and stfu”  and him not saying anything back because he was scared  Decisions lol "
So far this season he's been like Russell Westbrook but without the good parts
"This is just a dumbass take.   Go through the last 20 drafts, and tell me in how many of them is the no2 pick better than everyone drafted under him ?  2018 : still early, Bagley's been fine, but Doncic and JJJ are definitely ahead of him right now.  2017 : Lonzo, clearly outplayed over his career by Tatum and Mitchell, and outplayed this season by Fox  2016 : Ingram, more debatable but most would put Murray ahead of him, maybe Siakam/Hield in terms of current production  2015 : Russell, clearly outplayed by the likes of Porzingis and Booker, arguably Turner  2014 : Jabari, completely outplayed by Embiid, Randle and a bunch more  2013 : Oladipo. Close but arguably outplayed by Gobert, and obviously not on Giannis' level.  2012 : MKG. Ahead of Lillard and Drummond.  2011 : Derrick Williams. Ahead of Kawhi and Butler.  2010 : Turner. Ahead of Boogie, PG and Hayward.  2009 : Fucking THABEET. AHEAD OF TWO MVPs !!  2008 : Beasley. Ahead of Westbrook and Kevin Love.  2007 : KD.   2006 : LaMarcus. Close, but ahead of Rondo.  2005 : Marvin Williams. Ahead of CP3 and D-will.  2004 : Emeka, ahead of Iggy, Deng, ...  2003 : DARKO. Ahead of Wade. And Melo. And Bosh.  2002 : Jay Williams. Kind of unfair, but what are the odds he would have been better than Amar'e or Boozer.  2001 : Chandler. Ahead of Pau and Tony Parker.  2000 : Stromile Swift. Ahead of Mike Miller, Jamal Crawford, Michael Redd and goddamn this was a shit draft.  1999 : Steve Francis. Ahead of Ginobili, Shawn Marion, Artest, AK47, ...  So there you have, over the last 20 years, the no2 pick was actually the best player still on the board exactly **ONCE**.  So according to you, 19/20 no2 overall picks have been bad picks.  And that, frankly, is completely stupid.  If you keep going, I think there's a chance that every single no3 and no4 picks in the last 20 years have been bad too. Probably the majority of no1 overall picks have been bad.  **THE DRAFT IS A FUCKING CRAPSHOOT** at least after the first pick. Actually drafting the best player available is almost impossible and probably complete luck when it works out. So no, getting a dude with a no2 that isn't better than every dude drafted under him is NOT A BAD PICK. Getting a guy who's worst than the median no2 pick, THAT is a bad pick."

What makes them stat chasers and how would that make them to blame? Russell Westbrook is a stat chaser and they seem to be doing ok.
The Russell Westbrook: Triple double with more field goals than points
Russell Westbrook is a confusing entity
Isolation scoring stats last year:  1. James Harden. 12.2 isolation points per game.  2. Lebron James. 6.1 isolation points per game.  3. Chris Paul – 5.6 isolation points per game.  4. John Wall – 4.9 isolation points per game.  5. Damian Lillard – 4.2 isolation points per game.  6. Russell Westbrook – 4.1 isolation points per game.  7. Harrison Barnes – 4.0 isolation points per game.  8. Kevin Durant – 3.8 isolation points per game.  9. Austin Rivers – 3.7 isolation points per game.  10. Kyrie Irving – 3.7 isolation points per game. 
"Well, It's really hard for me to skip it, whenever I see that tag of yours. As a matter of fact, it's utterly repulsive how you are quick to judge some almost dream case scenario players, yet you are quick to find silver lining in everything wrong Russell Westbrook does. It's really not that hard to consider you a /r/nba court jester. "
By that logic Russell Westbrook is the best passer in the league 
1. LeBron   2. KD   3. Harden   4. Curry   5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Kawhi Leonard 7. Anthony Davis 8. Paul George 9. Russell Westbrook 10. Kyrie/Dame/Jokic/Embiid
"He has a good post-game. He is also a good passer, just not the primary facilitator. The only concerning thing about him is his height and wingspan. If the dude was a legit 6'8 with lemme say a 7'2-7'3 wingspan, I'd take him number one without a second thought. His motor and athleticism is not something you see everyday. How can you be as explosive as Russell Westbrook at 280?!?!"
lol  Do you even realize that your thresholds for your bball ref search are total points total rebounds and total assists? It's essentially a list of **every single season** sorted by win shares which you linked. It says literally nothing.   If you actually plug in all the per game stats (which is stupid because more than just a couple variables will pretty much always lead to an extremely cherry picked set of results) you get a list of Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook seasons.   Both of those are obviously known for their 30-10-10 campaigns... Nothing even remotely close to what Jokic is doing.

The one that lead his team past Russell Westbrook and Paul George
"Nope, he will never be a top 5 player without a jumper. It's not that he doesn't have a consistent jumper right, it's that he doesn't have one AT ALL. Who's the worst star shooter right now? Russell Westbrook, but he's still vastly superior to Ben Simmons at shooting. "
“Woj: Russell Westbrook is incredibly frustrated after becoming second option to Paul George. My sources tell me he has requested a trade.”
I have you tagged as claiming that Russell Westbrook and Steph Curry are better all time players than LeBron James. Can that possibly be true?

You seem a bit obsessed with Russell Westbrook look good bro probably not healthy 
"Dude seriously this sub is full of immaturity and memes lol. Dont take anything here seriously and just enjoy the game.  For context: i love watching James Harden and Russell Westbrook, yet almost everyone here thinks Harden is unwatchable and Russell Westbrook is overrated due to advanced stats and statpadding."
"How have the Lakers exactly recruited players by whispering negativity? You mean the Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard we have on our team now or?  Maybe you mean Rondo (NO) and Lance Stephenson (IND)? Huge signings from an amazing tactic...  How many GMs and coaches are ""worthy of the title"" and are available? They are probably so worthy that they don't wanna coach and manage these scrubs that aren't the top 5 NBA teams so they're waiting on them.  So many people have this ""just hire great coaches and the best staff, DUUUUH"", ""also draft the best players and develop them properly and have them all become 2nd best player on a championship team level MINIMUM OR BUST"" like that's not what every team in the NBA is trying to achieve."
russell westbrook is steph curry stuck in russell westbrook's body
russell westbrook averaged a triple double as a guard whos the same size as mitchell
I’d love to see what 2016 MVP Russell Westbrook could do in that season. It was the same year Oscar Robertson got his triple-double average. 
"League average is basically just offensive rating, it doesn’t tell you a lot. You had Mark Eaton types back then who barely went past half court on offence, and even now you’ve got guys like Tyson Chandler just never shooting the ball, they’re going to bring the average down.  I think the interesting thing for me is that it shows how efficient today’s top scorers are. Usage for MJ and Harden is very similar (38.5% vs. 38.3%), and even among their competition it’s about the same. Dominique was at 32.3% in 87 while Embiid is at 32.6% this year, and then there are a bunch of guys hovering around 30 in both years. However, all the guys with that kind of usage now are putting up a shitload more points, because with a couple of exceptions (eg. Lou Williams, Russell Westbrook) they’re all elite with efficiency as well as usage. That wasn’t really the case in the 80s, MJ was one of the few combining elite usage and efficiency."
"The Philadelphia 76ers have never won a game in OKC and have lost the 18 games they've played against us.  &amp;#x200B;  Since the trio came together in 2009 one of Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant or James Harden has lead the league in total points scored every single year except for last year. They also have 7/9 scoring titles with an 8th one likely to come this season."

"&gt; The Thunder Lost Harden because they were cheap as fuck, not because it used to be hard to retain multiple stars.  Not entirely, or effectively true.  If the salary cap is 50M, there's a significant different in the affordability of a team with the salary cap is say, 80M.  That extra 30M allows you 1) include another max slot player (if you choose) or multiple other players, and 2) avoids the line for the luxury tax, repeater tax, and even the hard cap under certain circumstances.  Were they cheap as fuck?  Maybe.  Or it could be they didn't think they could/should pay the max to Harden when all of Russ, KD, and Ibaka took haircuts on their 2nd deals.  As well as his performance during the 2012 Finals being fresh in their minds.  With the luxury tax trigger, that extra 4-5M in salary paid to James would have meant more like 2x or 2.5x with the luxury tax penalty.  With the huge jump in the salary cap in the coming years, James's salary differential would have cost them just that.  And OKC isn't a market that could have (then) predicted their future success would allow them to be able to afford so much more.  Here's a great ""what if"" article from BBallBreakdown:  [What if the Thunder never traded James Harden](https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/09/21/okc-thunder-hadnt-traded-james-harden/)  The most salient point from that is:  ""While new deals for Harden and Ibaka **would have sent the team into luxury-tax territory**, both players’ new contracts wouldn’t have counted toward the luxury tax until the final day of the 2013-14 season, as Danny Leroux noted at [Sporting News](http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-thunder-vs-warriors-russell-westbrook-james-harden-trade-okc/1tt026yq1lmjj1vh97biyotfwf) last November. **Had the Thunder slashed salary elsewhere between the fall of 2012 and the spring of 2014, they could have potentially dodged luxury-tax payments** while retaining all four members of their young core. Given the drastic salary-cap increases in recent years, their mistake is retroactively even more glaring.""  1) the luxury tax was coming - 2) the Thunder would have had to slash and burn the bench for 2 straight years to stay under - 3) the drastic spike in the salary cap was *retroactively* more important, meaning it probably a foreseeable mistake.  I say that because if the Thunder knew about it, they wouldn't have traded James Harden.  Period."

&gt;Russell Westbrook in 2019
"He once begged the official scorer for a tip rebound during a game. Legitimately hilarious. https://deadspin.com/russell-westbrook-got-a-triple-double-last-night-on-t-1691463808  There is certainly some truth in it, tho he’s a great player.     "
" &gt;Wait... since he will probably be in free agency or get traded soon, do you think the Knicks have a shot at getting Green, too, especially if Kevin Durant either stays with the Warriors or goes somewhere else?  We definitely could, but I'm not sure we'd want him. Draymond is currently making $16M per year, and he's putting up 7 pts, 8 rebounds, 6 asts. The Knicks are getting 8/9/2 out of Noah Vonleh this season for $1.6M. Basically comparable production for 1/10th of the price. Unless Draymond starts hitting threes I don't think he's going to be worth the money he expects to anyone, and he'll probably get paid by an incompetent FO and end up hurting their roster by eating up cap space.        &gt;That makes sense... though, why don't they just try to push for a 2020 championship and beyond? Trying to be better than Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls from the 90's, so to speak.  They may very well want to, I just don't see the urgency with them anymore. Not everyone has the insatiable killer instinct to just keep on winning and winning and winning. I'm not an insider or anything, but they seem kind of bored to me.     &gt; although, he could Russell Westbrook it and still stay faithful despite having not won a championship yet.  I sincerely doubt it. The Pelicans haven't been nearly as good to Davis as the Thunder have to Westbrook. Say what you want about Sam Presto, he's made some bad moves for sure. But he always puts his guys in a position to compete. The Pelicans have never put a truly good team around AD, now in his seventh season and 85 games under .500 for his career. I'm sure he wants out.    &gt; &gt;Heh, I'm outside the nation, so this might be a tad more difficult! But our main sports network airs the usual suspects: if it shows up on TNT, they're almost a shoo-in over here. ESPN-feature games? Haven't checked lately, so I got no dice here. &gt;   Get a cheap VPN and watch illegal streams. That's how we do it over here lol.      &gt;So, they're *not* coasting? That gave me a bit of chills. Granted, they're good teams, but still...  All three of them seem to be figuring stuff out. Embiid and Butler are figuring out how to gel together, the Celtics are trying to recreate last season with two max players (one of whom is integrating just fine, the other one coming off the bench for simplicity's sake), and Miami is just trying to stay competitive. I would look for Pat Riley to be a major player at the trade deadline.     &gt; &gt;You know what? It's been fun talking to you! Thank you for the discussion. See you around?  Definitely! It's been great talking to you too. "
"&gt; KD is almost certainly going to be offered the supermax, and Draymond will probably either be traded or walk in free agency. This is a part of the locker room drama I mentioned earlier.  Ah. Maybe Draymond is doing something like flailing in death throes in Golden State or what have you.  Wait... since he will probably be in free agency or get traded soon, do you think the Knicks have a shot at getting Green, too, especially if Kevin Durant either stays with the Warriors or goes somewhere else?  &gt; As for the rest of Warriors, players and organization alike, I think the reason they're so cool with it is less about having a team intact either way, and more about having already won three titles.  That makes sense... though, why don't they just try to push for a 2020 championship and beyond? Trying to be better than Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls from the 90's, so to speak.  &gt; There's a lot of parallels with him and LeBron before he left for Miami.  I just checked Anthony's age. He's 25, which seems about young enough to still have a shot at getting a championship in his prime. Seriously, though, the Pelicans might be disappointing him at this point... although, he could Russell Westbrook it and still stay faithful despite having not won a championship yet.  &gt; Yeah if you get the chance watch their games. It's hard because they're almost never on national TV but they're a fun team.  Heh, I'm outside the nation, so this might be a tad more difficult! But our main sports network airs the usual suspects: if it shows up on TNT, they're almost a shoo-in over here. ESPN-feature games? Haven't checked lately, so I got no dice here.  &gt; I expect Boston, Philly, and Miami in the playoffs, and at least some shakeup from the current seeding order is likely, but I doubt that anyone is holding back at this point unless they're wary of injuries.  So, they're *not* coasting? That gave me a bit of chills. Granted, they're good teams, but still...  &gt; You picked a good time to start watching. I think this years playoffs are going to be great.  Honestly, I've been lurking on this subreddit since midway through the 2018 Conference Finals. However, since I have this I-wanna-see-the-world-burn attitude, almost any team's interesting to me, especially this season. Lots of narratives:  * Will Golden State win their third championship in a row? * Will LeBron make the finals and become the Lakers' next star player? * Will Doncic be this generation's Dirk and send them to another championship run? * What will the post-LeBron Cavaliers do? * Now that LeBron is gone from the East, who will emerge victorious from the conference? * Will Toronto give Canada their first NBA championship ever?  And so on...  Yup. I guess this is a good time to start watching... if my schedule aligns, that is.  You know what? It's been fun talking to you! Thank you for the discussion. See you around?"
"And to think James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook were on the same team at one time. "
and that’s Russell... Russell Westbrook 
Russell..what russell has that many triple doubles.. OHH Westbrook! Thanks reggie.
Good thing Reggie clarified that it was Russell Westbrook.
This man is only in the NBA because he danced with Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook vs Joel Embiid is what I'm here for
A lot of players could easily average a triple double in today's era. That's why I'm not really impressed by Russell Westbrook
homeless* man russell* westbrook that can play defense and is highly regarded as a player people want to play with lmao but you wanna ignore that?

"Fun fact: Russell Westbrook was on the honor roll in high school and his dream was to go to Stanford, but they didn't recruit him for Basketball. He has also said that his favorite subject is math.  https://www.twitter.com/russwest44/status/4148707931?lang=en"

"Barring injury, this is the best All-Star list in my mind:  **West:** LeBron, Durant, AD, George, Jokic, Capela, Curry, Harden, Westbrook, Dame, DeRozan, Booker, Klay, with **2** of Jrue, KAT, Gobert, Conley, Fox, Adams, Luka, DeAndre, CP3, Tobias, and Nurkic (ik ik, West is stacked)  **East:** Kawhi, Giannis, Embiid, Blake, Drummond, Butler, Simmons, Lowry, Kemba, Kyrie, Oladipo, Beal, Vucevic, with **2** of Myles Turner, Middleton, Whiteside, LaVine, Trae, Brogdon, Russell, Aaron Gordon, John Collins, and Ibaka"
I want to see humility in a Spurs star. I know James is called King and he can be arrogant sometimes but I guess he earned it. I'm not saying other superstars are arrogant. I just like how Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard are just doing their jobs.  Maybe Stephen Curry would be a good fit too but I don't think someone as flashy as Russell Westbrook would fit Spurs. We all remember how weird it was when T-Mac was playing for Spurs.
Russell Westbrook 3/20
Imagine choosing to play with Russell Westbrook over Lebron 
OKC Thunder Three-Point Shooters  * Paul George - 37.8%  * Abdel Nader - 36.8%  * Jerami Grant - 35.7%  * Alex Abrines - 32.3%  * Dennis Schroder - 31.8%  * Deonte Burton - 30.8%  * Patrick Patterson - 30.4%  * Terrance Ferguson - 28.9%  * Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot - 23.8%  * Russell Westbrook - 23.6%  * Raymond Felton - 20.0%  * Hamidou Diallo - 20.0%  Oof. 
James Harden Chris Paul	 Stephen Curry	 Kyle Lowry	 Russell Westbrook Damian Lillard  Calling Kyrie not a top-5 point guard isn't that crazy imo. He has been really good this year though
Fuck I love Russell Westbrook. (except when he's doing the hating Embiid while beating us at basketball thing)
I love Russell Westbrook. He's such an enjoyable player to watch.
"I agree with this 100%. One player who I feel gets a bad rap is Oscar Robertson. Yeah his highlights don’t look great given the era but if he played today he would be this insane Russell Westbrook/James Harden combo. But if Harden played in the 60’s he would have been great, but we’d be laughing at how a fat guy dominated 60’s basketball. "
"[Curry] Russell Westbrook, what are you doing? “I DON'T KNOW”"
You can literally go into YouTube and find several Russell Westbrook stat-padding montages. 
"&gt; Kobe's championship without Shaq is more lauded than the championships with Shaq.  Remember what happened to Kobe after Shaq left?  He was so frustrated he almost forced himself off the Lakers.  Kobe didn't win big again until another top 5 center, Pau Gasol, came to the Lakers.  In hindsight, the single biggest criticism modern fans have of Kobe is that he chased Shaq off the Lakers and that they couldn't make it work.  Kobe cost himself titles, and cost himself any shot at overtaking Jordan in the ring count by forcing the Lakers to trade Shaq.  Shaq was still a marquee addition at the time he left LA, Shaq won another title without Kobe (in Miami) before Kobe another title without Shaq.     Kobe forcing the Lakers to trade Shaq is, IMHO, the second biggest fuck up of Kobe's career, the first being the rape he committed in Colorado.  Kobe forcing the Lakers to trade Shaq cost him, and cost the Lakers, rings, it cost them NBA championships, because Kobe only wanted to win rings if he got the undisputed credit for them.  Kobe let his ego get in the way of success, and because of that, he never caught Jordan.  For all his greatness, Kobe was an insufferably selfish athlete, who would rather be Batman and lose to the Legion of Doom, then to be Robin and win the fight against the Legion of Doom.   &gt;Harden can be self-fish just like Kyrie can be self-fish for wanting to be the guy on a team to win the championship. I prefer those players over players that just go and sign themselves to win championships by added their former MVP-selves to teams that were historically great because that just isn't a challenge at that point.   I don't have a problem with guys who want to get their shine.  I don't have any problem, for example, with Harden forcing a trade from OKC because he wanted to be the man on his own team.  If you have that ambition, that's fine, its your career and your life, chase your dreams.  All I ask is that you be consistent; if that's what you want in life, that's fine, but don't also say that titles are all that matter.  To Harden's credit, I don't think he's ever been a hypocrite about it; he admitted that winning MVP was super important to him.  He never downplayed the individual achievements.  I respect Harden for doing that.  If what you say is true about D'antoni doing what he did at the end of the year, then that's unconscionable; the #1 seed is what matters, once that's locked up, rest is the second highest priority.  A good coach should know that.  Steve Kerr has always known that.     &gt;I'd prefer to see the star that doesn't need the help of another superstar to win the championship over the star that wants to completely shift the balance of powers in the NBA to basically write the books into winning the championship just because he signed there.   Here's my problem with this line of thinking: why do we, as a society, always blame the smart kids?  I've heard this argument, or some variation of it, a million times, and you know what my reaction is?     I'm a warriors fan, but I also root for two of the most sad-sack franchises in sports: the 49ers and the Oakland A's.  The A's are so sad-sack that their first round pick in last year's baseball draft won the Heisman trophy and is probably going to play football, and the A's will get no compensation for losing him.  The 49ers have played 16 NFL seasons since Jeff Garcia left town.  Jeff Garcia was the last 49ers QB to make the pro-bowl.  The 49ers have posted 3 winning seasons and one 8-8 season in those 16 years, all those good years were when Harbaugh was coach, then, they wouldn't pay him and he went to Michigan.  The 49ers are a shitty, awful, losing football team.  They have the second fewest wins in the NFL over the last four seasons behind only the Browns and the Browns look to be on their way up.     Do you know why the 49ers and A's are shitty?  Not because free agents won't sign there, and not because a group of stars assembled on another team.  They're shitty because their ownership is horribly shitty, and capricious, and cuts every cost, and is only focused on the bottom line, and doesn't really want to win.  Matt Barnes once said there are only 5 NBA franchises that truly want to win championships, the Warriors right now are one of them.  The Lakers want to win, but they're a multi-billion dollar company that's run like a mom and pop operation.     The owner of the Thunder didn't keep the team in Seattle, he sold out a fanbase that had lived and died with the team when he could make a buck by doing so and he told Seattle ""nothing personal, just business"".  He wouldn't pay the luxury tax to keep James Harden, ""nothing personal, just business"".  He coddled Russell Westbrook.  KD is smart.  KD saw what was going on and left when he got the chance to, ""nothing personal, just business"".  KD was rewarded for it, with two championships and two finals MVPs.  In time, the entire context of what happened will disappear and all that will remain in people's mind is the bottom line.  That's what time does to human memory, it eliminates the day to day aggrevations and ups and downs and things become bottom line.  In the moment, every little detail matters, in the history books, here's what matters: did you win the war or did you lose it?     20 years from now, the context of how KD won titles will vanish, all that will remain is that KD won titles.  No one remembers the context of why Bill Russell's Celtics managed to assemble all-star teams every year and win all those rings in the 60's.  We just remember that he won them, and Bill Russell is as respected an athlete as has ever played in the NBA and the finals MVP was named after him.  No one remembers how the Celtics of his era stayed on top, time has eliminated the context.  All we remember is that Russell has all those rings.     KD is the smart kid.  He made the smart move.  He did what any owner, what any CEO of a billion dollar company would do in a heartbeat.  Why do we blame the smart kid for watching what others do and then doing the smart thing?  Why don't we blame the owners who are not willing to do everything required to win?  Only about 5 of them, in the NBA, truly want to win titles, why do we blame KD and not the 25 owners who don't want to win titles?  Why don't we demand that they up their game?  "

"Kawhi Leonard’s block on Harden then the dagger 3 from the 2017 playoffs.  Steph Curry’s halfcourt buzzer beater vs OKC in 2016.  Kevin Durant’s pull up 3 from game 3 in the 2017 finals.

Magic Johnson’s running skyhook game winner.   Larry Bird’s steal on Isiah Thomas then pass to Dennis Johnson for the game winner.  Shaq’s dunk against Portland from Kobe’s lob in 2000.

"When scoring a bucket in gargabe time against a tanking team means the same for this guy's list than scoring a game winning shot in the PO in a game 7 then that list has no value whatsoever.  Not to mention that he just puts the weight he wants on the things he wants.  Chris Paul as #21 player of all time ahead of Stockton, Curry, Durant or D-Wade is enough to just qualify that list as complete garbage.  Im sorry but KG at #8 is insane.   &gt; I think a reasonable downgrade is fair, but that still leaves Pippen in the top thirty.  Pippen was in the low 40s of that list when it was released. We are talking about a guy with 0 MVPs, 0 finals MVP and 7 All-Stars that averaged 16ppg in his career. There are a lot of players that have more accolades, more awards and better stats than him .... and actually leading their teams.  Duncan, Kobe, Lebron, Gary Payton, Garnett, D-Wade, Allen Iverson, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden and Russell Westbrook  would all enter for sure in a new top 50 list and that will put Pippen out of the list guaranteed."
"AI was a beast but he was really inefficient, he really was.  In 2001, at his absolute peak he lead the league with 30.4 ppg, but shooting 39.8% from the field and 29% from 3P taking 4.5 3-pointers a game. That was horrendous shooting in any era of the last, at least, 40 years.   The average FG% in 2001 was 44.5% and currently we are sitting at almost 46% FG. So yeah, 15-20 years ago, players shot a bit more inefficient but we arent talking about the 1940s or 1950s here where they shot in the low 30%.  AI took 28 shots per game to get those 30 points and he was shooting around 10FT per game too.   Iversons career eFG is 45%. He was the posterboy for shooting inefficiently for a reason. Just imagine if a slightly less efficient 2018/19 Russell Westbrook took 25-28 shots a game. That was AI at his peak, scoring wise.  "

Curry  Westbrook  Irving  Kemba  Paul (hurt)   Wall (hurt)   Rose  Lowry  Lillard  Conley  Jrue  J.Murray  Fox  Russell  Dimwiddie  Bledsoe   Schroder  Clarkson   Dragic (hurt)   JJB (hurt)   I mean DSJ  could be in the top 20 if you account for all the current injuries, even though he himself is injured too (debatable).   Also I probably missed some guys "
I’m not sure this guy has ever seen Russell Westbrook or Monta Ellis play basketball lol
All that being said we should all settle this one and for all: James Harden is better than Russell Westbrook and will be ranked higher in the all-time list. 
What if you replace Russell Westbrook with Tom Brady.. Will OKC be able to beat Golden State? 
"You realise Adam's getting the rebound and doing an outlet pass to westbrook running down a lane is always faster than russell westrook chasing after a rebound and then dribbling full speed down the court.  &amp;#x200B;  You pass faster than you can run.  Additionally, the time taken for Westbrook to chase a rebound rather than whoever gets it first wastes so much time"
Paul George shoots more shots than Russell Westbrook. 
"He obviously is, but that literally means fuck all.  It's like saying Grayson Allen has the best stamina out of all bench players.  He doesn't need stamina, he just needs to try and be effective for his 10 minutes.  Similar to Russell Westbrook.  If he went down to averaging 5 rebounds per game, their record would be the same "
 The thought of Russell Westbrook earning All Defense honors is ducking disgustint
Harden also played on a team with KD who already established himself as a superstar and Russell Westbrook who was a great number two option.
&gt; Russell Westbrook isn't a championship calibre point guard and definitely not the right point guard to take OKC to the finals.  fixed it for OP
So Russell Westbrook sucks now?

Ever hear of Russell Westbrook or AI?
"""Russell Westbrook All Lowlights"" "
Russell Westbrook has the worst triple doubles sometimes.  26 points on 30 shots...yeesh
This game for Russell Westbrook was a bit of a YIKES
"This game is why Russell Westbrook will never win a finals. Paul George has barely even touched the damn ball this game. That's some bullshit. I don't understand how any star player can stand playing with him, and it's probably part of why Durant left. Shit is terribly obvious. "
"GOD BLESS RUSSELL WESTBROOK, FUCK THE LAKERS "
"G: Curry/Kyrie/Kemba  G: Harden/Lillard/Beal  F: Kawhi/George/LeBron  F: Giannis/Durant/Griffin  C: Jokic/Davis/Embiid  Order Of Guards next in line: Westbrook, DeRozan, Holiday, Doncic, Conley, Simmons, Oladipo, Russell (guard spot is stacked)  Forwards next in line: Harris, Aldridge (could be a c), Galinari, Thad YOung  Centers next in line: Towns, Capela, Nurkic,  "
missed thousand of layups &amp; mid-range shots and hit a clutch three   It's a Russell Westbrook Show
I think one of my favorite non-storylines from this season is that Russell Westbrook is averaging a triple double again this year and nobody is talking about it......like literally fucking NOBODY
"Steph Curry - Damian Lillard - Kemba Walker James Harden - Russell Westbrook - De'Aaron Fox (yeah, I said it) Kevin Durant - Kawhi Leonard - Paul George Greek Freak - LeBron James - KAT Anthony Davis - Nikola Jokic - Joel Embiid "
"Nice defense Russell ""Brodie"" Westbrook."
I’d prefer Russell Westbrook bricks and ill-advised decision making in crunch time 
something about the way Russell Westbrook walks really bothers me
“Russell he’s going to say his first words!”  “S...s...s...statpadding fuck Jesus dude stop shooting jumpers”  That baby’s name? r/nba westbrook 
"Let's figure all time everybody else:  Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, KD, Steph, Bill Russell, Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Moses Malone, Dr. J, Oscar Robertson,  Iceman Johnson, Charles Barkley, KG, Pippin, The Admiral, Ewing, AI, Dirk, Jason Kidd, Pistol Pete,Westbrook, Harden.   Now who to pick in that bunch?"
"yeah i agree hes so trash, let me know when he averages a triple double like the goat russell westbrook /s"
"Steph/Draymond to Cleveland, JR Smith/Delly to Golden State  Ben Simmons to Phoenix, Dragan Bender to Philly  Kawhi Leonard to Chicago, Robin Lopez to Toronto  Russell Westbrook to New York, Mario Hezonja to OKC  Giannis to Memphis, Marc Gasol to Milwaukee  &amp;#x200B;"
"They have a weird slump because Adams ankle is preventing him from actually being a dfensive anchor. With Noel back, maybe they get enough to destroy our mediocre offensive scheme. All we can hope for is a slug fest where maybe PG isn't shooting well and russell westbrook attempts to carry the team on his back with tight contested 3 point shots."
"He can be Russell Westbrook without the triple double hunting and a better J, look at the mentality he has when he's on the court, dude was always at 110% in the footage of him I've seen pre-NBA"
"Did I dismiss him? That's just how he was evaluated coming out of high school. He has long term potential but he's not someone you look at who oozes superstar like a Shaq, Durant, or LeBron.   Also, the likes of Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook are the exception, rather than the rule. You can point to them as an example of low ranked talent succeeding but for every one of them there are dozens if not of hundreds of similarly ranked players that don't even sniff the NBA."
"That will determine who's underrated according to the kinds of basketball obsessives that make lists, and the kinds of basketball obsessives that read lists.  But amongst people who only watch their home team, and only watch ten games a year, and tune into the finals? They might think Russell Westbrook is still an MVP candidate. They might think Dwight Howard is having a better season than a guy like Paul Millsap. That's who this measurement is targetting."
OP is fooling everyone and has Russell Westbrook as his #1 over Steph lmao
 This is true. It genuinely blows my mind that a player can score damn near 60 pts &amp; still lose to a shitty team. He's in the inflated stats HOF with Antoine Walker &amp; Russell Westbrook.
"&gt; Kyrie Irving, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook are all more entertaining to me  I can dig it.  I definitely respect that.  I guess it all depends on what style you prefer to watch.  Great shooting will always be on top for me.  I think it's the satisfaction factor."
"Kyrie Irving, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook are all more entertaining to me, the problem with Steph to me is that he is entertaining to watch but sometimes a lot of his highlights are threes where he just catch and shoots off a screen which I find boring."
&gt; It’s his ft% that’s dragging down his ts% to horrible levels.  If Russell Westbrook only shot FTs he'd lead the league in TS%.  That's not it.
"Man Kyrie had Kobe in his ear , lol Kobe is my favorite player but he’s the same guy that told Russell Westbrook he needs to have the ball more when he had KEVIN DURANT on his team."
"Rondo is not a top 15 point guard, not even close. I’d take Harden, Curry, Westbrook, Kyrie, Lillard, Simmons, Holiday, Lowry, CP3, Kemba, Wall, Booker, Conley, Fox, Bledsoe, Russell, Brogdon, Lou Williams, "
"It's hilarious how you just minimalized the Grizzlies and **THE ROCKETS** just to help your non-existant point 😂😂😂😂😂😂.       You talking shit about the Grizzlies like they didn't have 2 All-star level players in Mike Conely and Marc Gasol.  Who did the Rockets play in the First Round? Oh yea Russell Westbrook and.....oh wait, just Westbrook 😂  You wanna talk shit about Kawhi's opponent's, when Harden's team was beating up on Westbrook and bunch of role players 😂 GTFOH       And it's even more hilarious you are trying to minimalized the Rockets team of that year. That team was the Favorites in the Spurs/Rockets series. Most people where picking them to beat the Spurs because of how great they shot the three and how old the Spurs key players were.       You may have a terrible memory, but I don't. And there are plenty of facts online that showed just how great that Rockets team was. Those facts disagree with your failed attempt to lessen Kawhi's accomplishment.       Oh year Harden can explode more that Kawhi right? Where exactly has that ""explosion"" gotten him in the Playoffs? A bunch of terrible shooting nights and flat out choking. Yea he leading his team alright 😂😂                    "

We wouldn't let him get open. In a world where Russell Westbrook won mvp despite being one of the worst jump shooters in the league.
5 better playmakers: Lebron Rondo John wall Russell westbrook Draymond green Jurkic Ben simmons Chris Paul  Oh i named more than 5 oops  Lmao if scoring is part of playmaking then harden definitely is nowhere near the best playmaker in nba history
*Russell Westbrook would like to know your location*
Bah Gawd that's Russell Westbrook music
"It's not sarcastic tho. Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure.  Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play. That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luka Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luka Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luka does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luka Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero."

In fact, Harden is among the league leaders in scoring efficiency every year.  He's pretty much as as far from a chucker as you can be.  Are you sure you aren't confusing him with Russell Westbrook or something?   "
[Kobes stats compared to Russ in their 11th seasons](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1=westbru01&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id2_hint=Kobe+Bryant&amp;player_id2_select=Kobe+Bryant&amp;y2=2007&amp;player_id2=bryanko01&amp;idx=players) As good as Kobe was. I was slightly shocked Russ was putting up more points in the playoffs
"If we compare bands to basketball, obviously Russ would be your lead singer / rock star.  PG is the lead guitar because he strums along through the game then has awesome solo moments  Steven Adams is the drummer that anchors the beat, keeps things together.   Then the PF and SG are the bass guitar and keyboard players that can be interchangeable, depending on who’s available (injured list or session musicians).  Now the back up musician for OKC is obviously Dennis Schroeder. He’s got the talent, he’s got the moves, but he just doesn’t have the xfactor that Russ has. He can probably be a star in his own team / band, but it’s just not as good. He could probably do well in Germany, though! But then again, he’s happy where he is playing back up to the rock star that is Russell Westbrook."
"As aassive russ fan no, one good chance he will never reach russes absolute peak. Two his playstyle only seems similar because he’s fast and competitive, his dribbling and driving look more smooth than russ where russ would just manhandle opponents. Of course young russ didn’t do this as much but young russ id say was more athletic still. Fox is a better shooter and shot decision maker, like some other people were saying I think he can become a more athletic mike Conley rather than a Russell Westbrook. "
"russell westbrook spent a bunch of time deep in the playoffs, averaged a triple double in back to back seasons, and has the flyest clothes"
Isn't Westbrook the best defender at his position? Source: Russell Westbrook
Why would Russell Westbrook play next to Kyrie Irving? Obviously that wouldn't work.
"If you think assists or points create are the best way of measuring passing ability/vision, you are fooling yourself. (They are still valuable. You just need things with them.)  If you think Russell Westbrook is anything less than one of the top ten passers/court vision people in the league, you are also being ridiculous."
Russell Westbrook
Well if you want to go like that then Russell needs three more and there need to be 13 15 / 15 / 15 games by players not name to Russell Westbrook. That would put him at 9/60 or 15%
"Jesus, I'm so tired of people repeating cliche bullshit thinking they're making legitimate points. LeBron is an amazing floor general, Harden is probably the best ISO player in NBA history and Russell Westbrook has two or three of then ten highest usage seasons in NBA history with no ability to play off ball.  You can't just say ""Oh LeBron will make them better"". He can't. LeBron gets absolutely fucked when his teammates don't move off ball, and neither Westbrook nor Harden are great off ball. Westbrook playing off ball is basically Westbrook standing still."
"did they already do a ""russell westbrook cant shoot and its a problem"" article? or does that one where they didnt have him as a top 25 player in the league already count. "

Sheeesh that would be even worse. Stripping Westbrook and Harden of their by far best skills would make this a hilarious train wreck. Especially for Russell. Is he supposed to shoot corner 3s or what?

Russell Westbrook. Everyone not on the Thunder and not named Mr. Spalding is an enemy. Even both rims are enemies.

I don't know if coaches will vote for him now that he is injured or maybe they will, and then select an injury replacement.  **West:** B- Lillard B- Westbrook F- Jokic F- Davis F- Gobert WC- Klay WC- Aldridge  Just missed: Towns, Harris, DeRozan, and Doncic.  **I would select Towns,** but the coaches will select a Spur."

Head of surgery at Johns Hopkins University and Bullshit artist here.   Definitely should have counted as an assist. Pauses like that get counted all the time. If Russell Westbrook had made that pass it would have been scored an assist.   
"Less Lakers games on TNT would help, more OKC games featuring Russell Westbrook."
Why is scoring unassisted something to be amazed by? Yay James Harden has mastered hero ball!   Did you ever notice how one of the key metrics tracked by the Warriors is total team assists? A high number means they are sharing the ball and taking higher percentage shots.  Hero ball doesn’t work come playoff time. Just ask Russell Westbrook and Damian Lillard.  
[And Westbrook.](http://www1.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Russell+Westbrook+2008+NBA+Draft+0C2fcR6cxc1l.jpg) Nice try.
Lol so you’re linking me a play in which we where up double digits with a minute left in the fourth quarter? Who the hell cares? Are you going to act like there’s not a whole seasons worth of data showing Russell Westbrook contested less three point feild goals then the likes of Deandre Jordan and Hassan Whiteside?
"People hate harden too but they respect him, which is pretty much what happened for Westbrook. To answer your question tho it's cause people think the thunder had someone else who could create a shot so when he is the only one able to create shots for him and his team, the nights he struggles looks bad. And when those games happen Russell haters come alive and call him a stat padder and overrated "
"also, just because i love it, we are currentl comparing russell mvp triple double westbrook to our second year point guard and it's not even a long bow to draw. that just makes me happy."
"He's also leading the league in USG% by a mile. Guess what, when you're trying to score a bunch people will foul you a bunch. Also, a smaller share of his possessions end in FTs compared to Giannis and Embiid.    Usage Pct  1.	James Harden • HOU	40.6  2.	Joel Embiid • PHI	33.1  3.	Lou Williams • LAC	31.9 4.

"i don't think you are making the point you think you are making. simmons is in his second year, is 22, and you are already comparing him to russell 'triple double' mvp westbrook. that's damn high praise, whether you meant it or not"
"idk.. KD, ""Evil"" LeBron, Kobe, Dwight, Russell ""statpadding-chucker-not the real MVP"" Westbrook, Draymond Green.. hmm lots of strong contenders"
Ok with the assists part. I think its realistic for Russ considering he is the point guard. But to expect Westbrook to rebound like Wilt and Bill Russell thats a bit crazy.
You have it all wrong bruh. Getting a triple double in a game is a great night but averaging a triple double for an entire season is out of this world. How is what Fultz and Lonzo doing the same as Russell Westbrook?
"They should not suspend the Denver players off the bench, and I only need 1 reason. Russell Westbrook didn't get suspended when the same thing happened last postseason."
*Unless you're Russell Westbrook and it's the playoffs because exceptions
"negatives:  * drummond is not a good basketball player * ish smith, the best point guard on the team, has been injured, and we've been forced to rely on turnstiles like calderon and jackson who also can't score or facilitate for anyone else * stanley johnson is the same player he was 3 years ago * bruce brown has started many a game for us stones * we pay drummond, leuer, galloway, jackson insane amounts of money, which has prevented any significant roster changes (this might be the biggest reason, tbh)  positives: * blake, who will either request a trade or stop trying the longer this goes on because no human can possibly put up with this * bruce brown, who plays a lot and is like if russell westbrook lost all his basketball skill, can play defense * reggie bullock can shoot * ish pushes the pace well * we have our first round pick this year,,,,for now"
The final straw  Rachel Demita &gt; Russell Westbrook
"A ""supermax"" is just a 35% max that players can get earlier than the 10 years required for their standard max to be 35%.  You can read this if you want:  24. What is the Designated Player rule? What are the performance criteria for earning a higher maximum salary? Certain players can receive contracts or extensions that are more favorable (in years and/or salary) than they ordinarily could receive. This applies to players who are finishing their rookie scale contracts (and other players with four years of experience), who can receive a starting salary up to 30% of the cap (which is normally reserved for players with 7-9 years of service). It also applies to players who are finishing their rookie scale extensions (and other players with eight or nine years of experience), who can receive a starting salary up to 35% of the cap (which is normally reserved for players with at least 10 years of service).  In addition, players signing a rookie scale extension can be designated by their team to receive a longer extension, totaling six seasons (including the season remaining on their rookie scale contracts).  In order to qualify for the higher maximum salary, players must meet certain performance criteria1. At least one of the following must be true:  The player was named to the All-NBA First, Second or Third team in the most recent season, or both of the two seasons that preceded the most recent season. The player was named the Defensive Player of the Year in the most recent season, or both of the two seasons that preceded the most recent season. The player was named the NBA Most Valuable Player in any of the three most recent seasons. For example, if this is the 2018 offseason, then a player meets the performance criteria if he accomplishes any of the following:  Named to the All-NBA First, Second or Third team in 2017-18 Named to the All-NBA First, Second or Third team in both 2015-16 and 2016-17 Named the Defensive Player of the Year in 2017-18 Named the Defensive Player of the Year in both 2015-16 and 2016-17 Named the NBA Most Valuable Player in 2015-16, 2016-17 or 2017-18 The naming of these rules and criteria are somewhat inconsistent and confusing. The Designated Veteran rule allows teams to sign or extend players with eight or nine years of service to a higher salary (up to 35% of the cap). The Designated Rookie rule allows teams to sign players finishing their rookie scale contracts to longer extensions, but does not provide for the higher maximum salary (up to 30% of the cap). In fact, there are no performance criteria the player must meet to qualify for the Designated Rookie rule -- he just needs to be designated by his team to receive a longer extension. The higher maximum salary for these players is provided by the 5th Year, 30% Max criteria. And while the criteria are the same for players with eight or nine years of experience to qualify for the higher maximum salary (up to 35% of the cap), the CBA calls it the ""Designated Veteran Player 35% Max Criteria"" for these players.  A player's eligibility for a higher maximum salary doesn't imply he will actually receive that amount -- as with all contracts, the actual salary is a matter of negotiation between the player (or his agent) and his team. However, a Designated Rookie must receive at least 25% of the cap. In addition, for players entering their fifth season the exact percentage of the cap can be based on how the player meets the 5th Year, 30% Max criteria. For example, a rookie scale extension can specify that the player will receive 27% of the cap if he meets the criteria by being named to the All NBA Second Team, 28% if he meets the criteria by being named to the All NBA First Team, or 30% if he meets the criteria by being named Most Valuable Player.  There is a limit to the number of designated players a team can have on its roster at a time. A team can have up to two designated rookies (who received a longer rookie scale extension) and up to two designated veterans (who received higher than the 30% maximum salary) at any time.2 However, only one designated rookie and one designated veteran may have been acquired from another team in a trade.  A designated veteran extension can only be signed from the end of the July Moratorium through the last day before the start of the regular season. A player who signs a designated veteran contract or extension can't be traded for one year after he is signed.  In summary, the kinds of contracts and extensions that can be signed using the Designated Player rule and the 5th Year, 30% Max Criteria are as follows:  Type	Qualifications	Maximum Salary	Maximum Years Designated Rookie Extension	Entering 4th season of Rookie Scale Contract; designated by team	25% of cap (30% if meets 5th Year 30% Max Criteria)	6 (including remaining year on current contract) Free Agent Contract after Rookie Scale Contract	Finished Rookie Scale Contract, or 2nd round pick or undrafted player with 4 years of service; designated by team	25% of cap (30% if meets 5th Year 30% Max Criteria)	5 Designated Veteran Extension	7 or 8 years of service when extension signed; 1 or 2 years remaining on contract; with same team continuously (unless traded during first four years in the league); meets Designated Veteran Player 35% Max Criteria3	35% of cap	6 (including remaining years on current contract) Designated Veteran Contract	8 or 9 years of service; with same team continuously (unless traded during first four years in the league); meets Designated Veteran Player 35% Max Criteria	35% of cap	5 The mechanisms for extensions are covered in question number 58.  1	In 2017 only, the previous criteria applied for players finishing their fourth season to earn the 30% maximum: A) The player was named to the All-NBA First, Second or Third team at least twice; B) The player was voted as a starter in the All-Star game at least twice; OR C) The player was named the NBA Most Valuable Player at least once. 2	Players who were waived continue to count toward the team's limit of two designated players for the remainder of the original term of the waived contract. However, if the player's cap hit was stretched (see question number 64), the player does not count toward the limit during any stretched-over season. For example, if a designated veteran is waived in 2020 with only the 2020-21 season remaining on his contract, and his cap hit is stretched across the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, the player will count toward the limit of two designated veteran players in the 2020-21 season only. 3	Russell Westbrook and James Harden were grandfathered into this rule. Even though each had signed an extension in 2016, they are allowed to sign new extensions per the Designated Veteran rule in 2017 (both players) or 2018 (Harden only) if they remain with the same teams (Oklahoma City and Houston, respectively) and meet the performance criteria."

"""First time in 7 years Westbrook has talked trash to him""  Just Russell Westbrick getting bailed out by MVP caliber teammates again, nothing new here"
"Russ is not a generational player, he's a superstar and a hell of a stat stuffer. Dude is not even currently a top 5 option in the League. OKC is lucky that Lebron went to LA, which turned Paul George off from signing there, if Lebron didn't sign with LA, PG would have left OKC w/o a blink (fact).   You said, ""no free agent will come to okc because they don't even value their franchise player.""...Currently I don't see many free agents salivating at the mouth to play alongside the ego that is Russell Westbrook. Its only a matter of time before the honeymoon b/t PG and Russ ends, and if OKC is smart, they find a way to divorce themselves from Russ before PG demands a trade and the whole things falls apart.   I get it, you're an OKC fan, its hard to look at the big picture especially when your team has ride or died with this ""generational"" player for the last 10+ seasons, but honestly the true generational player (KD) already left. The window to win a title in OKC is closing for Russ &amp; Co. GSW ain't going anywhere, the Lakers will soon be a major threat, Rockets can be a thorn, Spurs are always a threat with Pop, Jazz are heating up... Somethings gotta give for OKC. "
"[No Slight Intended, Dame and Russ have mutual respect for each other](https://www.blazersedge.com/2018/3/3/17074456/damian-lillard-russell-westbrook-all-star-controversy)  &gt;“He was the first guy I saw,” Lillard said. “As soon as he came in, we made eye contact, we both laughed. He was like, ‘Man, you know we’re better than that.’ I said, ‘I know.’ I said, ‘But you know I take exception to everything.’ We literally laughed about it.”  &gt;“It wasn’t a big deal,” Lillard said. “Me and Russ have always had respect for each other.”  Lillard went on to explain to Freeman how he was never truly worried about Westbrook being upset with his selection:  &gt;“I don’t feel like I ever complained about not making it, I just said I should make it,” Lillard said. “I figured he could have been talking about somebody else. But I think because everybody always goes to what I say, they were automatically going to say it was me. I said it was disappointing because I know that there is a level of respect between me and him.”"

&gt;Fake mvp  Check the record books  &gt; fuck russell westbrook. garbage ass phony. least deserving MVP since malone  Bit over the top isn't it?  
"fake mvp. westbrook only got that award because the media doesn't understand how pace and boxing out works. the reality is that his shot selection is cancer and was holding harden and KD back.   if you put lillard on that 2012 finals team, his spacing opens up the floor like westbrook never could and OKC wins a ring. OKC lost because westbrook cared more about getting his numbers than moving the ball around. he was always the least skilled of the 3 and he knew it.   even now, the idiot prides himself pulling arbitrary stat combination when the data shows the single biggest predictor of OKC's success is when westbrook gets 10 assists. the reason? okc has several above average players that never get planned against because the competition knows russ would rather take the shot himself.  fuck russell westbrook. garbage ass phony."

Of all the listed 6'3 guards. Russell Westbrook is the only one that's actually that height.   I actually think he's a bit taller even. He has great posture 
"Lebron is clearly behind Jordan as a scorer. I'm just saying he is not so far away that it gives Jordan a big advantage.  Scoring titles are meaningless because there is no consistent criteria. One year a player can win the 'title' averaging 29.1ppg the next year he can lose it averaged 29.9ppg. It's all relative to the other great scorers in the league at the same time as you.   The only great scorer that was competing with Jordan for the scoring title in 1990, 1992, and 1997 was Karl Malone. In 91 Karl Malone and Bernard King were the elite scorers competing with Jordan. In 93 it was Malone and Dominique. In 1997 it was just Malone. In 1998 it was Malone and Shaq.  Lebron was competing with Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, and James Harden. Not to mention guys like Gilbert Arenas and Anthony Davis popping up here and there.  Lebron is 2nd to Jordan in scoring in so many ways. MJ has the most 30 point games of all time. Wilt is 2nd. [*And Lebron is 3rd.*] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=E&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=30&amp;order_by=pts). Lebron is well ahead of guys like Kobe and Kareem and they played 20 years to Lebron's 15.  By playoffs alone [Lebron is 1st all time in 30 point games nobody else is close to these two](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=30&amp;order_by=pts). Lebron is also first all time in playoff points.  He's [2nd all-time to Jordan in playoff 40 point games](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=40&amp;order_by=pts)  And if you factor in efficiency one could easily argue Lebron is as good of a scorer as Jordan--but that's not my belief or my argument. My point is, Lebron is 2nd or 3rd all-time as a scorer to Jordan and Wilt."

It’s what led to the conversations about uncontested rebounds, an obvious and fair point as long as it didn’t lack nuance.   Westbrook broke defensive conventions so that he could head to the block and consume boards, no question. And no matter what the team said publicly, there were constant private conversations about how to turn Westbrook into more of a defensive contributor without hurting his rebounding numbers.   He led the NBA in uncontested rebounds, per NBA.com’s SportsVU data. But that, alone, didn’t turn him into a pedestrian rebounder. He still corralled the second-most contested boards of any guard. And keep in mind, no matter how many jokes there were about him phoning a hitman whenever another Thunder player would steal a rebound: If Westbrook and a teammate had an equal chance at a board, the Thunder wanted it to be Westbrook’s.

"there was a point where the Thunder had Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka and Reggie Jackson. that's 3 MVP level players, a fringe all-star and a PG with the talent to contended for 6MOY if that was his role, all on one team. so yeah i'm sure we will see 4 all-stars on a team again in the future. but the Warriors are better than 4 all-stars, Steph and KD will at the very least be recognized as top 15 players of all-time when they hang it up, Klay Thompson will be recognized as one of the greatest shoooters ever and Draymond Green will be recognized as one of the greatest swiss army knife type of guys..   you can have a team with 4 all-stars quite easily but that's not saying much.   I doubt we see a team with the Warriors level of talent ever again. it seems like it was in our destiny to see a dominant team but the Thunder fucked that up when they stole the Sonics from Seattle and gave themselves all that bad karma.."

  I'm getting downvoted but if these are the locks:  * James Harden * Steph Curry * Kevin Durant * Anthony Davis * Paul George * Nikola Jokic * LeBron James * Damian Lillard  You need to pick 4 of these guys to fill out the all star roster  * Rudy Gobert * Karl-Anthony Towns * Russell Westbrook * LaMarcus Aldridge * Mike Conley * Jrue Holiday * Luka Doncic * Danilo Gallinari * Tobias Harris * DeMar DeRozan * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Klay Thompson
Russell Westbrook and James 'Litter Hilter' Harden will never win a championship ring.    Ya boy Lonzo Ball will.

*Ben Simmons doesn’t shoot 3s*  “What a coward”   *Russell Westbrook shoots 3s*  “He should do what Ben Simmons does”
"Yes, regardless of Lowe saying that Russell Westbrook should be an all-star, Russell Westbrook will be an all-star."
Russell Westbrook seems to have figured it out
Russell westbrook killed the triple double.
Russell Westbrook can't sleep at night because when it gets dark he thinks Heat Check Klay is hiding under his bed. 
"It's mostly addition by subtraction. CJ is pretty much Melo-lite. He doesn't add anything to our team except offense and not in a good way. It's only self-promoted offense.  Here's an old snippet from Quick after losing to OKC...  ___  Stotts became increasingly terse as I asked three consecutive questions about McCollum’s play, before finally ending his 2:46 media session with “I’m not going down this line with you.”  The “line” of questioning?  Q: What do you make of CJ’s play this season?  A: [Scoffs] “I think he is giving good effort. He’s probably not shooting the ball as well as he would like, or we would like, but I think he is competing. He was guarding [Russell] Westbrook who finished with 31 points). Unfortunately for CJ, people are going to tie his play into how he’s shooting the ball. He hasn’t shot the ball as well as we expect, or he expects to … so unfortunately, I don’t think that’s the sole determinant of how he’s playing this year.”  Q: So the saying goes, “If scorers aren’t scoring the ball they have to find a way to impact the game in other areas.” Do you feel like he is impacting the game in other areas?  A: [Five-second pause] Sure.  Q: Which areas do you feel he is making an impact?  A: I’m not going down this line with you.  Stotts had more to say later, when he called me into his office to protest what he considered “unfair” questions, but it’s telling that he couldn’t come up with examples of how McCollum is making an impact outside of his scoring."

"You're saying ""all-time great COACH"". Not offensive coach or offensive strategist. What all-time great in any field is there that can't or won't do 70% of all the other stuff, can't or won't make adjustments within a game or series, and has never dominated his contemporaries in terms of overall accomplishments?   &amp;#x200B;  There's already Popovitch, Jackson, Auerbach, Riley, Brown, Daley, Kundla, Sloan, Wilkens, etc. Then there's Kerr, who has been more successful (it's not like MDA didn't have Kobe, Gasol, Nash on a single team), Spoelstra if you just want to go by success, and Stevens (who is young but looks to have more versatility and is on the up-and-up). This is like saying Russell Westbrook deserves to be in the top 10. I don't even think Lebron is in the top 10 safely, but at least Lebron has a championship. I'll be surprised if MDA is even a top 20 coach, never mind top 30 or 40. "
"Yup, I think it's a good comparison.  The major differences are that...  Fox is the better defender and has better shooting mechanics  Morant is more athletic and is a better playmaker.  Morant is like Fox mixed with a little Russell Westbrook"
"He also didn't have to face the caliber of explosive scorers that Paul has had to.  He never had to defend Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Tony Parker, Damian Lillard in playoff series.  Paul played in that era and STILL made 7 All-Defensive 1st teams."
"None of this is official but this is my two cents   The REAL contenders: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Myles Turner, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard.  People who will get consideration and maybe an All-Defensive team but won't win: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday Steven Adams Marc Gasol  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler  Victor Oladipo  "
Russell Westbrook. We live by the Bestbrook and die by the Worstbrook.
It always baffles me that Reggie thought he should be starting over Russell Westbrook during his okc days

Last trade. Team Lebron gets Ben Simmons from Team Giannis for Russell Westbrook.
"I cant’ remember it word for word but it was after the Russell Westbrook and Ben Simmons trade, and Barkley said something along the lines of: “To complete this trade, Giannis needs to trade his whole bench for Anthony Davis” (AD being on Bron’s team)"
"I can not believe that someone would break up a core of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. smh"
"Team LeBron:      LeBron James (LAL), Kevin Durant (GSW), Kyrie Irving (BOS), Kawhi Leonard (TOR) and James Harden (HOU) as starters.   Anthony Davis (NOLA), Klay Thompson (GSW), Damian Lillard (POR), Ben Simmons (PHI), LaMarcus Aldridge (SAS), Karl-Anthony Towns (MIN), Bradley Beal (WAS) and Dwyane Wade (MIA) as reserves.

Westbrook for Simmons. Lebron heard Giannis wanted Embiid and Russell on the same team since they hate each other

"lol, no one wants to play with James Harden and Russell Westbrook in an All-Star game."
[Wut?](https://giphy.com/gifs/russell-westbrook-RdmUbfmYYWeOY)
Dray is like a big Russell Westbrook as far as energy/hustle is concerned.  He disrupts opposing offenses and is a pf that plays like a pg while not holding onto the ball.  Tobias is really good too.  I just don’t think Draymond has dropped off besides being injured/out of shape for parts of the season.
[Young] Russell Westbrook   3 of the words I did not expect to see right now that initially gave me a heart attack
According to Nate Duncan Russell Westbrook isn't a top 15 PG in the league. There are apparently 15 fucking point guards better than Russ this year.
"I’m not upset with you, that’s what you’ve heard.  I’m an actual example of a fan that goes to games though.  That kind of hate would not be tolerated by surrounding fans.  Russell Westbrook made a comment in the playoffs last year about one of our fans.  Then a video came out a few days later that contradicted everything Westbrook said.  I can’t remember all the details, but Westbrook exaggerated everything.  "
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Russell Westbrook  Pick 3 guys that AD is better than. "
"No, Russ's statistical impact was much greater.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/  Harden earned his last season though for sure."
He 100% deserved it. He lead the league in just about every advanced stat there is and broke a record no one thought could ever be touched. He earned it.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/  This sums up his statistical impact quite nicely.  I think Harden absolutely earned his MVP last year btw.
Russell Westbrook and Nobody 
He’s more of a stat padder than Russell Westbrook?
"I fully believe that Brandon Knight could be great on the Thunder if given the minutes, he's a Russell Westbrook extremely lite and could play some minutes at the 2 if we need an offensive punch off the bench"
Russell Westbrook is nothing? And y’all got PG a year later lol
"It's pretty simple. It's just a matter of many people especially on here wont like hearing the answer why or be in denial about it.   Ask NBA players what their least favorite venue to travel and play in is? Utah will come up ALOT. This goes way beyond Russell Westbrook and what he said last year in the playoffs.  All that stuff sticks with a player. You would think ""Oh a player should be able to recognize just because their fans say some really shitty and racist things to them they should know that isn't how the organization is!"" but that's honestly naïve and not how things work in reality. And I don't really blame the player either  Conley has no control of where he is traded to. A lot of this comes down to him and Memphis have a good relationship, both have meant a lot to each other and in an ideal world Memphis wants to do him a solid and not send him to a team he doesn't want to play on. But again that's an ideal world. "
"Like I said before, people have a natural tendency to remember the bad more than the good. To them, it doesn't matter how many points he scores, how many wins, or other accolades he gets. Those clips of him flopping or abusing the rules will forever stay in their mind. Even other superstars get this type of treatment. Russell Westbrook despite his historic numbers and achievements, is still hated on because of clips of him *stat-padding* and *stealing rebounds*. Kevin Durant, no matter how good he plays, still gets hated on because he signed to the Warriors. All I'm saying is, no matter how minuscule that part of his game is, this sub won't forget. And its justified. Watching a player foul bait even once in a game makes fans lose respect, and over the years it can make fans hate the player. If that's not clear to you, I don't know what to tell you."
"Which is exactly why his value will be so high. I think Jerry West could easily get a team to pay more to get him.   The Thunder have a trade exception that could fit him, and with Paul George and Russell Westbrook, and without much cap space to finagle, I could see them trading Salary Cap filler + 2 firsts for LouWill.  Toronto could make salary work. And Milwaukee is gonna have to make some decisions on some guys, and could see them give a bunch of assets for a really team friendly contract. Either by 3 way trading with Bledsoe, or using Brogdon. Lou Will is too valuable to keep imo"
Russell Westbrook is the worst starting point guard in the NBA
Fine I’ll say it....I love Russell Westbrook 
Russell Westbrook what.gif
Triple Russell? Double Westbrook? 
Supposed to be a scorer?  A player who averages under 14 shots a game is supposed to be a scorer?  Player: FGA/pergame Steph Curry: 19.8 Klay Thompson: 18.4 Lebron James: 19.4 Kemba Walker: 19.7 James Harden: 24.1 Russell Westbrook: 19.6 Kevin Durant: 19.0 Devin Booker: 19.0  Jayson Tatum 13.3 (16.1pts) Brandon Ingram 13.7 (17.2pts)  But yeah he's a SCORER who can't average 20 points 
"Yes he is. Hes like if russell westbrook was born less talented, dumber, and more selfish"
"I don't think Myles Turner is better than Russell Westbrook. That being said, at this stage of both of their careers, Turner probably provides a better reason to be optimistic. He's eight years younger. Westbrook plays a very deep position. We will see how 18 million a year plays out for the Pacers. "
how many heads does myles turner have shaped like a pineapple? 1      russell westbrook? 0
I think the Lakers need to make a play for both Russell Westbrook and Paul George.   Lakers will be willing to give up everything plus four first round picks and buy Singlers bad contract.  OKC will blow it up and build around Steven Adams and Terrance Ferguson.
"Sauce is so loveable, and frankly thought he was underrated.  He was one of the best drive and dishers to the bigs on our team.  Just really bad at defense still.  Baldwin needs direction, but he has insane defensive potential.  If he has a defined role he can be really good still, but recently when he gets PT he reverts back to trying to be Russell Westbrook and he really is bad at that.  Very likeable guys though."
"I had literally the same team minus Russell Westbrook for Klay Thompson.  159-144 with finding shooters, then iso  I guess I chose the wrong strategy lol  all I know is that my starting rotation all had above average to great 3 shooters + giannis so it sounded like a good idea"

Russell Westbrook is leading the league in assists by a pretty wide margin.  I don't think Smart should be an all-star either but Lowry really didn't deserve to be there.
We live in a timeline where Russell Westbrook is actually the least hated member of the original OKC big three. How's that for irony? 
"Russell Westbrook for sure, but I don't know which way it goes  People might see multiple years of triple doubles and huge stat output, an MVP, holder of a ton of trip dub related records, etc. and think he is a top 25 all time player - very Oscar Robertson-esque.  Or maybe this era will be looked back on as one of huge, empty statistical output, kinda like how we see the 60s, and all these triple doubles and big stats will be discounted and disrespected, as will Russ"
Russ Westbrook will be viewed as an icon. Even if he never wins a ring. Like a modern Allen Iverson.  Allen Iverson streetwear. Russell Westbrook is fashion forward. Wears very bold outfits.  Allen Iverson was an underdog. Getting the 76ers to the Finals was glorious. Westbrook is an underdog since K.D left. And the Thunder are still contending.  Allen Iverson very well known for crossover. Westbrook very well known for Triple Doubles.  
He's 30 and is on the books for like [160 million dollars over the next 4 years](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/russell-westbrook-6141/cash-earnings/)  Whoever trades for him would have to give up so much in terms of contracts and picks they coudnt add any pieces around him  
"Basketball wise, sure, it’s dumb.   But Russ means more to Oklahoma than just basketball. He stayed with us. When everyone said he should and would leave, he stayed. With little small market gets made fun of Oklahoma. And he convinced PG to stay.   If you knew Oklahoma like I know Oklahoma, you’d know. The people here would rather lose with Russell Westbrook than win with Michael Jordan. "
I like watching the things that Russell Westbrook does.
Russell Westbrook and Daniel Orton
"&gt;I can't wait for him to be exposed as an overrated fraud anyway. I have been saying this for years, he is the SOFTEST player at that length I have ever seen. Kobe doesn't have that length and still had a great post game, there's no reason KD can't have at least an alright one. &gt;Westbrook&gt;KD I'm hoping WB at least plays out the season with OKC and gets amazing numbers, maybe even beats the Warriors in the playoffs.  &gt;obviously. russell is an alpha dog - a bully on the court. kd is a servant - that weird anime nerd that gets bullied for being a bitch. no comparison.  I saved a lot of comments like these so just tell me if yall wanna hear more lmao"
Terry Rozier &gt; Russell Westbrook 
cue in Russell Westbrook and triple doubles. 
"You can’t blame Russ for that 2017 being in the clutch a lot, KD leaving them holding their dicks decimated that team. You can however, give Russ credit for turning those clutch moments into victories.  You don’t think clutch performances are important? The Thunder were a .500 team based on points for and against that season, but managed a .573 record literally because of Russell Westbrook willing them to victory. "
Same goes for Westbrook. I remember Oscar Robertson having averaged a triple-double over an entire season was seen as one of the best accomplishments in sports history. And now Russell does it three times in a row and nobody seems to care. 
Russell Westbrook
"There's a major difference between this MVP race and that one.    In 2016-17, Harden's stats were very close to Westbrook's, but Harden was significantly more efficient, and had a significantly better team record.  [Player comparison for reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id1_select=James+Harden&amp;y1=2017&amp;player_id1=hardeja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id2_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y2=2017&amp;player_id2=westbru01&amp;idx=players)   This year, Harden has significantly better stats, while Giannis has the significantly better team record.  Their efficiency is pretty even, and the advanced stats go both ways (some favoring Harden, some favoring Giannis).  [Player comparison for reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id1_select=James+Harden&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=hardeja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id2_select=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=antetgi01&amp;idx=players)    **tl;dr - Harden's stats are much better than Giannis' this year, whereas Westbrook's stats were only marginally better than Harden's in '16-'17.**"
"Steven Adams, Terrance Ferguson, Hamidou Diallo, André Roberson, and a pick.  Also throw in Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Nick Collison’s retired jersey, Chesapeake Energy Arena, and Rumble the Bison."
"I just want to say anytime i go onto a post regarding harden or westbrook all i see are clearly biased people only presenting certain facts to argue about mvp races. First off, harden's season this year is not even close to westbrook's mvp season. Westbrook had adams, oladipo, and sabonis. I'm not trying to argue it was the greatest supporting cast but it certainly wasn't the capela/austin rivers/g-league wing team that harden is carrying right now. Harden is also playing much more efficiently than russ did that season while also playing better defense. And I know people will argue harden isn't good on defense but it's pretty damn hard to be worse than russ was that season on defense ([https://thebiglead.com/2017/03/24/is-russell-westbrook-padding-his-rebounding-stats-by-leaving-his-defender-stats-say-he-is/](https://thebiglead.com/2017/03/24/is-russell-westbrook-padding-his-rebounding-stats-by-leaving-his-defender-stats-say-he-is/) ). Also, saying ""oh this sub hated westbrook that year"" is about the stupidest argument i've ever heard that proves absolutely nothing in comparing two very different, incredible seasons."
"I would not refer to Russell Westbrook as a ""basketball genius""."
"I love this idea. Also think dunks should be part of box score as well as 3-shot fouls. Maybe one day we'll have %Sprinted, which is a stat that Second Spectrum already tracks ... LeBron (on defense) and John Wall would not like that. Russell Westbrook would ..."
"That’s also partly cause they have the NBA honors show at the worst time imaginable. No one really cares about Russell Westbrook winning MVP 3 months after he gets eliminated. They’re regular season awards, there’s no reason why it shouldn’t be right after the regular season and before the playoffs, it’d give the playoffs some extra narratives too."
"Essentially, Russell Westbrook creates more good looks for his teammates than anyone not named LeBron James or James Harden. For reference (he has regressed since), his 2016-2017 was the greatest box creation season of all time. Ive never seen a player drive to the rim with such ferocity. The defense collapses and he rockets a pass to a shooter for an open/semi-open 3s. Unfortunately, OKC sucks at open 3s. Despite Kyrie being an amazing scorer, much more efficient than Westbrook, the game is not called who has the best TS% and points per 75 poss, a true advanced star student knows this. "
Anyone that says Russ is one of a few options:  - Russell Westbrook himself or any of his close family or friends.  - A dumbass.  - Doesn't watch any basketball whatsoever.
"Steph curry is better than russell westbrook has ever been, so I’ll pick curry"
"Ahhh, interesting (Russell Westbrook voice)"
Russell Westbrook 
"Russell Westbrook benched 185 lbs 12 times at the NBA combine, Henry benched 225 22 times at his combine.  Also, Henry ran the 40 in 4.38 seconds at 250 lbs. Westbrook is just over 200 lbs and can't run that faster.  I don't even understand this comparison. Henry is much bigger, stronger and faster than Russ is lol."
"I'm fine with Russell Westbrook getting triple doubles, but that Russel Westbrook guy would be so much better if he stopped getting them"
"it would be pretty favored for USA.   **USA:**  * PG: Steph Curry * SG: James Harden * SF: LeBron James * PF: Kevin Durant * C: Anthony Davis * 6: Paul George * 7: Kawhi Leonard * 8: Kemba Walker * 9: Kyrie Irving * 10: Damian Lillard * 11: Russell Westbrook * 12: Bradley Beal  &amp;#x200B;  **World:**  * PG: Ben Simmons * SG: Luka Dončić * SF: Giannis * PF: Nikola Jokic * C:  Joel Embiid * 6: Rudy Gobert * 7: Steven Adams * 8: Danilo Gallinari * 9: Nikola Vucevic * 10: Pascal Siakam * 11: Domas Sabonis * 12: Deandre Ayton  Honorable Mention: Dragic, Markkanen, Marc Gasol, Capela, Porzingis, Bogdonovic  &amp;#x200B;  I think it's closer than some think, but the USA team wins 130-115 IMO  &amp;#x200B;"

"Superstars have very high basketball iq, otherwise they would not be superstars. You could argue that ”low bbiq superstar” is an oxymoron.  You think Russell Westbrook is not a superstar? Fine, that’s on you. If you have watched Russ on a consistent basis and without your black tinted hatred goggles on you’d know that Russ has exceptional feel for the game and indeed very high basketball iq. It’s a big part in why he’s on of tve leagues best players and a lock for the hall of fame."
russell 'iq' westbrook
russell westbrook is a triple double machine
Russell Westbrook with the Westbrook special  14 points on 17 shots  Christ
That's only one aspect of what's going on. Don't ignore; yes Russell Westbrook is a CHUCK but there's many teams he could have went to with stars that would retain balance. And for GSW there many all star they could have gotten being a 73-9 team that's weren't super stars to retain balance.
"that's Russell ""35% 3 point shooter in his last 6 games"" Westbrook to you"
Jared Goff and Russell Westbrook both crushing Boston today 
I love seeing Russell Westbrook happy 
I agree. People need to stop citing one stat to encapsulate the way a player affects their team. TS is great for simply understanding how efficiently a player scores the ball. You can look at Russell Westbrook and say he's bad on offense because of his TS% the same way you can say that Draymond Green is bad on offense because he doesn't score.  
Yeah but Russell Westbrook makes his teammates worse /s
"Can't say I like the way he plays, but this is still an impressive feat regardless of your views on him. Congratulations Russell Westbrook."
"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/  In the first stats there it shows WB's stats from his MVP season compared to Oscar's. Russ's numbers are quite similar aside from points, but even this season his per 100 scoring numbers are higher than Oscar's in his triple double season.  Efficiency matters and Oscar's was higher to be fair. Oscar was damn efficient for his era."
Insanity to me that Dirk &gt; Russell Westbrook is being downvoted 
"You're right. No player has ever tried to pad his stats before. Russell Westbrook only averages a triple double for three seasons in a row because he's the first to try it. Thank you for showing me the truth. Lebron must have been lying when he said he didn't think it was possible to break that record. [In fact, all of these players are just faking.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-nba-players-react-to-russell-westbrooks-triple-double-record/) Any one of them could have done it if only they had tried."
"Or Russell Westbrook, the former MVP who you guys say is playing the best basketball of his career lol. If lack of help was a contributing factor to his MVP, surely it should be for Harden this time"
And they once said that Russell Westbrook don’t make his teammates better.
Is Russell Westbrook a good basketball player yet?
Problem is the Bucks have the NBAs best record and Giannis is insanely efficient and the team crumbles without him. Russell Westbrook is still on the thunder and is avging a triple double.
"Russell Westbrook has weaponized the fact that he is a shot chucker. Watching this game has proved that to me. He takes a lot of shots, but because he is able to hit them at an inconsistent rate you can’t not defend him.   He uses that time to adjust and make the right passes because defenses fully expect him to shoot. He weaponized his chucking."
"This isnt always true because there is a point where you are overtraining and damaging your muscle memory. On top of that, his arm fatigue is heavy during games from getting rebounds, handling the ball most of the time, and making passes that arent your typical ho hum chest pass -- usually across court. Most shooters and point guards dont exert that kind of energy in their arms. Your average point guard stands until a big passes him the ball and then walks into a halfcourt set. Your average shooter stands until someone gives him a simple chest pass or bounce pass and he catches and shoots or gets a jumpshot somehow. Russell Westbrook doesnt get that privilege. He is running the full length of the court at every possession, using his arms to fake out 5 defenders with multiple pump fakes and then finishing the play with crazy effort passes. It hurts his energy and shooting touch."
"Goddammit. You don't even present a coherent argument. You just insult another person. What is wrong with you? Are you drunk?  It took 50 years to break maybe because nobody saw any value on that. Maybe? If Russell Westbrook doesn't win the championship, how are you going to say his effort is justified?"
"Hey OP! I agree with you. Russell Westbrook isn't getting enough credit. His shooting has fallen off a cliff true. And hopefully Westbrook doesn't take as many shots in the playoffs as hes taking now. But yea, he's not getting enough credit.   3 straight seasons with a triple-dub. 3. T H R E E. No other player in the history of the NBA/ABA has averaged a triple-dub for 3 straight seasons. As a whole, Westbrook is amazing.   I feel like years down the like will we only recognize his feats. As much as his shooting sucks, he's excelling in just about every other area."
"Seriously what's with all the clueless thunder flairs???  [Westbrook had arthroscpopic knee surgery on his right knee in September](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/09/12/russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-arthroscopic-surgery-right-knee). Yes, it was on the same knee he tore his meniscus.  Westbrook was still putting up decent numbers, but then he suffered an ankle injury about a month later that forced him to miss 6 games.  A lot of fans over at /r/thunder have been speculating that he never really recovered from the ankle injury.   I personally think it's likely a combination of the weak ankle and his leg muscles still not being where they need to be. His shots have been short a lot this year, and although he's used the glass a lot in his career, this season has been the most I've ever watched him try to go glass. It makes me wonder if he's resorting to that so that because it's a larger target. It may not be pretty, but he's been hitting the shot."
Russell Westbrook is living proof that it doesn't. 
Lakers should've traded for Russell Westbrook

# RUSSELL WESTBROOK GOAT 
"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Russell Westbrook the stat padder? It's an r/thunder legend. Russell Westbrook was an MVP candidate of the Thunder so athletic and so angry, he could use his stats to influence the subreddits to create...hype. He had such a knowledge of stat padding, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from rebounding. He became so hyped, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his stats...which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught James Harden everything he knew. Then James knocked him out in the first round. Ironic. He could save others from elimination... but not himself.  I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns."
Russell Westbrook ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"Fun fact: In the 2016 season, Russell Westbrook assisted Kevin Durant more than any other player in the league assisted a teammate"
Says the guy claiming that the ball moves faster with somebody dribbling it than somebody throwing it to the same location. It’s at the point where if Russell Westbrook started actively trying to get turnovers for quadruple doubles you would probably defend that too.  At least Russ knows who to call if he ever needs to get a tractor trailer full of bottled water into the Bahamas for a musical festival.
"Aight blog boi let's see this data  Personally I think we're having disagreement on the usage of ""Streaky""  When I think streaky shooters I think of JR Smith, Marcus Smart, Russell Westbrook who all have their 3pt% year by year jumping all over the place with high variant. "
"The most commonly accepted theory Paul George resigned because of Russell Westbrook and the culture around the Thunder-- Not to mention that they are also more competitive than the Lakers. Also, just because ESPN reports constantly that a player wants to go to team XYZ doesn't mean its reality. 'Member when LeBron was definitely going to the Knicks?"
"Kyle Lowry averages Post Season 2018: 17.4/4.3/8.8 on 51-44-82%, 65% True shooting Percentage(Same as Curry in 2017) And was 10% Better than Chris Paul on a similar Volume   2018 Series Cavs/Wizards  Kyle Lowry 16-17 Post Season - 16 Points on 11 shots, 6 A / 3 RB Shooting 46/34/82 &amp; 59% TS  Kyle Lowry vs Caveilers and Lebron   2016-2018 averages:  21 PPG 3.6 RPG 6.3 APG on 50.2% FG and 43.3% 3PT vs the Cavs. (61 TS%) (averaged 20PPG on 56%FG in the first two games Vs The 2017 Cavaliers before he left the series with ankle problems)  Kyle Lowry has a higher TS% than Russell Westbrook and Damian Lilard in the NBA playoffs.  Kyle Lowry in game 7’s  24.6 PPG  6 RPG 7 APG 1.7 SPG, 43.4 % FG 47 % 3FG  Kyle Lowry also leads the League All-Time for Playoff Buzzer Beaters under 2:10 Minutes  Kyle Lowry:14 Lebron James:11 Kevin Durant:8"
"MVP Conversation? No.   Underappreciated? Absolutely.   We literally spam this sub everyday about players not caring enough and it triggering people. I've never once felt cheated watching Westbrook play because of his intangibles. He's tough, goes 100% every game, and is absolutely a competitor. We gripe about stars being lax and complacent yet when we have guys that aren't, we want to parse and pick apart every aspect of their game. Russell Westbrook is offensively inefficient as far as shot making and does chase triple double more often than most will admit, but I've never once doubted his intangibles, unlike some of the other supposed stars and players in the league. Paul George is the best player on the Thunder this year but Russell Westbrook is the leader of that team. A real leader, not one of these wannabes like we see with some of these other teams. They follow him willingly and through hell and I respect a legit star that can lead like that."

"I’m not sure about his FG attempts, although it could all be connected, but Royce Young wrote an article about why Russ’ free throw shooting may be down the past 2 years.   [Royce Young Article](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25664754/russell-westbrook-roller-coaster-offense-slowing-thunder-nba)   Athletes are creatures of habit so this may contribute to his season long shooting slump from everywhere if he can’t find his shot at the line."
make this post 10 years from now and see how many people say russell westbrook 
Fuck a city. He needs ~~a day named after him.~~ [everyday named after him](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-okc-mayor-declares-every-single-day-is-now-russell-westbrook-day/amp/)
Russell Westbrook
"I have owned 4 different players jerseys in my life  1. (First jersey) Kevin Durant  2. (2nd jersey) Russell Westbrook (after KD left)  3. Nazr Mohammad Don’t ask me why. He became my all-time favorite Thunder player as a kid. I saw his first second as a Thunder player in person and the next game I was at I made my grandpa, who offered to buy me a New Jersey  (I was 8 or so) buy me a customized Nazr Mohammed Jersey because they didn’t sell his jersey pre-made.   4. Damontas Sabonis  I bought myself a custom made Domantas Sabonis Jersey during his rookie season expecting him to stay in OKC forever and become a building piece. I was right in the aspect that he would become a building block of a midwestern city’s franchise. He is still one of my favorite players.  I have pictures if you don’t believe I have a Sabonis (OKC) or Mahommed (OKC) Jersey. "
Russell Westbrook has played 2 season without KD or Paul George. He missed the playoffs in one and was the 6 seed that lost in the first round in the other. He won a MVP but he was built to break Oscar Robertson’s record which would automatically win anyone a MVP. I love Russell (literally my hero) but I also love the truth. Don’t say I’m not a Russell fan but he isn’t the same GENERATIONAL talent as AD. He is just a HOF talent so please forgive me.’
Demar Derozan ==////= Russell Westbrook  &amp;#x200B;
Yes.  Not cause they would had AD.   But because they finally could have gotten rid of the team Cancer Russell Westbrook without the fans having a reason to be pissed off as AD is the better player
"Yes, I meant his splits. They were far off. KD was exceptionally bad to close that series, as was Russell. If KD played up to his standards, they would have won. His defense was average to good for the majority of the series but that doesn’t take away from how poor he was on the other end.   I get that you’re trying to absolve him as much as possible, but it’s abundantly clear that he was bad and that the Thunder has no business losing that series. KD and Westbrook deserve equal blame for that choke "
"Kevin Durant playing with Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Steven Adams would be pretty fun"
Russell Westbrook TS%
"This is the thing that I keep on asking of my friends who like Harden.  If you were playing pickup with a dude that hunted for the fouls that Harden does and pushes off all the time to clear space like Harden does, wouldn't you fight that guy?  How can they love it in the NBA but then despise it when some fool is doing that shit to them on a court?  I don't get it.  He 100% could cook fools without any of that shit.    Then people say ""don't hate the player, hate the rules - the game""  But how can we not when he takes the shit to such a ridiculous extreme?  No one in the league does the shit he does.  Is it because they can't?  Or is it because Russell Westbrook and Steph don't give a fuck whether there's a ref on the court - they are gonna cook guys regardless?  It's just a completely different mindset and they could give Harden 5 MVPs and it will never change the fact that his signature move is a travel and his best season coincided with the season where any team could put up 140 on a given night because blowing on a player was called a foul."
"Russell Westbrook will settle into his new role and become the best ""two way"" point guard in the league next year "
"No, you just didn't understand it, apparently.  ""KYRIE IS REALLY GOOD AT BASKETBALL"" is not in any way a counter-argument to ""Kyrie is not fun to play with"". I didn't say he was playing badly, I said he *wasn't fun to play with*.  His teammates *are not having fun*. Contrast with, say, Russell Westbrook/Steph Curry/Luka Doncic/Damian Lillard, all of whose teammates are, clearly and visibly, *having fun*. Those players can all run the point while also *being fun to play with*.  I mean, your imagined take that Kyrie sucks is not good, it's true, but that's not what I fucking said, so."
"There's probably a problem in the numbers when Russell Westbrook is listed as a more impactful defender than PG.   Defensive advanced numbers still have a long way to go. They're poor at accounting for lineup data, they often way overrate steals/blocks, and they don't really have a way of accounting for great defense that doesn't end in a shot.   If PG locks a player up on the perimeter for 6 or 7 seconds, then that player passes out to another player who has to heave up a bad shot because there's no time left on the clock then PG destroyed that possession. However the defensive stats just don't account for that. It's the same with post defense. If you get posted up, completely stone wall them then they pass it out, you killed their possession but get no credit for it.   There's still a long way to go before we can figure out really accurate defensive advanced stats."

"If Russel was LeBron, this sub would've exploded. But since it's Russell, this should be a stat-padding. This subis so good in minimizing the greatness of others especially Westbrook and Harden but always overrating LeBron. Smh."
"Russell ""Moses"" Westbrook parting the defense in half :/"
ESPN: Nobody wants to play with Russell Westbrook
Russell “North Rhine-Westphalia” Westbrook 
"How long have you been watching basketball if you don't think 4.5 attempts per game is a lot when you make 25% of them for 10 years? Obviously he isn't taking 8 or 9 like Steph. Steph is both the best catch-and-shoot and off the dribble shooter of all-time.   3 point shooting has exploded in NBA over the last few years. For reference, in the 2003-2004 season, the Seattle Sonics (Listed as Oklahoma City) led the NBA in 3 pointers attempted at 23.6/game. Cleveland was last at only 9.6/game(!). So far during the 2018/2019 season, the Clippers are last in the league in 3 point attempts at 24.8/game while Houston is 1st at 44.4. These figures very clearly demonstrate how the league has changed. Only two teams shot over 20 3s/game in 2003-2004 and now they all shoot basically 25: (https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/three-pointers-attempted-per-game?date=2019-02-10)  The ""high volume"" that I referenced has to do with career 3 pointers attempted and made. Among the 127 players who have taken 2500 3s, he is dead last in percentage. Allen Iverson, someone I think Westbrook is likely to be compared to down the line, is 125th. Both of these guys had complete offensive autonomy throughut their careers. Take a look: https://fadeawayworld.net/2018/11/26/russell-westbrook-is-one-of-the-worst-3-point-shooters-in-nba-history/  "
"I love how the last sentence is just a nonchalant ""Russell Westbrook just made another triple double record even considering PGs amazing performance but no one gives a shit lol:?"""
"It’s a pretty good indicator of who is MVP. Since Steve Nash last won, the only MVP winners not to lead the league in it were Kobe, Derrick Rose, and Russell Westbrook, the three most controversial mvp awards of the past decade. "
"So imagine this NBA in the late 00's: These would be 16 best team lineups if every lottery team picked the IMO best available players at the moment in the drafts from '96-'09, and then never traded them away, based on these [redrafts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aohdgx/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_february/eg3jzov/) I've done in the past few days. So here's basically if every team played their cards right in the 90's and 00's drafts:   Team | PG | SG | SF | PF | C | Bench including ---|---|----|----|----|----|---- 1. Raptors | Allen Iverson | Richard Hamilton | Rashard Lewis | LaMarcus Aldridge | Chris Bosh | Andrei Kirilenko, J. R. Smith, Raymond Felton, Taj Gibson, Tony Battie, *Kurt Thomas* 2.

Clippers | Tony Parker | Stephen Curry | Peja Stojaković | Josh Smith | Dirk Nowitzki | *Jerry Stackhouse*, Baron Davis, Goran Dragić, Josh Howard, Jamal Crawford, Ersan İlyasova, Aaron Brooks, Brevin Knight, Nenê 4. Grizzlies | Steve Nash | James Harden | Vince Carter | Stephen Jackson | Mehmet Okur | Manu Ginobili, DeAndre Jordan, Al Horford, Caron Butler, Michael Redd, Boris Diaw, *Joe Smith* 5. Warriors | Mike Bibby | Tyreke Evans | Joe Johnson | Carlos Boozer | *Kevin Garnett* | Ben Wallace, Shane Battier, *Bruce Bowen*, Kyle Korver, Devin Harris, Randy Foye, Derek Anderson, D. J. Augustin 6. 76ers | Rafer Alston | Kobe Bryant | Tracy McGrady | P. J. Tucker | *average C* | Trevor Ariza, Ramon Sessions, *Michael Finley*, *Sam Cassell*, *Eric Piatkowski* 7. Hornets | Kyle Lowry | Wilson Chandler | Danny Granger | Elton Brand | Al Jefferson | Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Marcin Gortat, Nicolas Batum, Brandon Jennings, *Alonzo Mourning*, *Dikembe Mutombo* 8. Wizards | José Calderón | Rasual Butler | Ron Artest | *Rasheed Wallace* | Pau Gasol | Luol Deng, Matt Barnes, *Donyell Marshall* 9. Cavaliers | Jason Terry | Jason Richardson | LeBron James | Lamar Odom | Shareef Abdur-Rahim | Luis Scola, Ben Gordon, Morris Peterson, Troy Hudson 10. Timberwolves | Stephon Marbury | Steve Francis | Jeff Green | *Antonio McDyess* | Kevin Love | Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, Raja Bell, J. J. Redick, Jarrett Jack, *Robert Horry*, *Eddie Jones* 11. Celtics | Chauncey Billups | DeShawn Stevenson | Ricky Davis | Jermaine O’Neal | Joakim Noah | Andrea Bargnani, Keith Van Horn, Tyson Chandler, Troy Murphy 12. Thunder | Andre Miller | Luke Ridnour | Leandro Barbosa | Blake Griffin | Marc Gasol | Andrés Nocioni, Brook Lopez, Emeka Okafor, J. J. Barea 13. Bucks | Chris Paul | Ray Allen | Anthony Parker | Thaddeus Young | Udonis Haslem | *Jason Kidd*, Kirk Hinrich, Eric Gordon, Cuttino Mobley, Darren Collison 14. Magic | Eddie House | Mike Miller | Matt Harpring | Dwight Howard | *Shaquille O'Neal* | Brad Miller, Keyon Dooling, Andrew Bynum, Ronnie Brewer, *Chris Webber* 15. Trail Blazers | Delonte West | Louis Williams | Kevin Durant | Rudy Gay | *average C* | Ryan Anderson, *Brent Barry* 16. Nuggets | Dwyane Wade | Paul Pierce | Tayshaun Prince | Tim Thomas | *average C* |   Honorable mention: Detroit Pistons with Larry Hughes, Gerald Wallace, Carmelo Anthony, Stromile Swift and Juwan Howard.   Yeah, I can edit those rankings if you've got a convincing argument. I also added counted a couple of players from 1991-95 drafts, mostly notable ones who played into the late 00's, and re-drafted those drafts just with them. Though they're in italics and most likely benched, since most of them declined by then. If a team lacks ideal lottery picks in a position, assume an average player in that position is there."
Even Russell Westbrook has to poop sometimes.
Russell Westbrook the 2015 John Cena of the nba?
Russell Westbrook said that (American) Football was his favorite sport growing up but he played Basketball because of how good he is
"We fucking won. In the third quarter, we made 7 straight field goals and forced a lot of turnovers. Paul George sparked a comeback with thirteen in the quarter. Schroeder and Ferguson sustained it with sniper aim, scoring 12 and 11, respectively, on the quarter. In the fourth quarter, the thunder were rolling when Paul George was in, but when he came out, Russ started taking a lot of shots, missing quite a few, and the Rockets took back the lead. Paul George came back in, sinking shots when we needed it, and scored 15 in the final frame, exactly when the team needed it. James Harden got 42 points, his 70th 40 point game, but it was the first time he was outscored on one of these games. In the final minute, Russell Westbrook scored a lead-taking driving layup, and closed out a defensive possession against James Harden, perhaps due to James Harden making a judgement error by pulling up from around thirty feet out with mere seconds remaining while only down one point, and missing his shot.  Personal copypasta from another comment of mine. Basically we made changes at halftime and started making our shots. "

6. Russell Westbrook
Russell WestBrook and Steven Adams are on your team 
And Russell Westbrook should get an award for getting quadruple doubles with turnovers
"I think almost every single player in the NBA can use both of their hands well enough, but in basketball you have to have extremely precise movements with your hands and for that reason, players always prefer their strong hand. Russell Westbrook is a bad shooter with his strong hand. He would be an even worse shooter if he used his off hand even if he was fully ambidextrous "
This guy’s only purpose in life is to hate on Russell Westbrook. Just look at his post history lol.

I did this for seasons [96-97](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aldhhd/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_january/efeyteq/?context=3), [98-99](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/am2uvj/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_february/efl48jd/?context=3), [00-01](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ameuej/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_february/efn7s0t/?context=3), [02-03](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/anrksz/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_february/efxhhvj/?context=3), [04-05](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ao4kwk/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_february/eg0opnw/?context=3), [06-07](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aohdgx/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_february/eg1sbpe/?context=3) and now 08-09. Those draft classes shaped the peak years of my NBA following. Yeah you can disagree with me on anything here, sure that's natural, but at the end of the day you can argue that there's as much subjective as objective elements to it.  Ranking all the draft lotteries I did by strength starting with the best: **'96, '03, '98, '99, '09, '05, '08, '01, '07, '04, '02, '97, '06, '00.**  And here's something interesting for an epilogue: A roster of 14 players from those 14 years, starting with the first pick of the worst draft IMO, all the way to the 14th pick of the best draft, ranked above:  **SF** Hedo Türkoğlu (From 2000, 1st pick, 16th IRL)  **PG** Rajon Rondo (From 2006, 2nd pick, 21st IRL)  **PG** Chauncey Billups (From 1997, 3rd pick, 3rd IRL)  **SF** Caron Butler (From 2002, 4th pick, 10th IRL)  **SF** Luol Deng (From 2004, 5th pick, 7th IRL)  **PF** Thaddeus Young (From 2007, 6th pick, 12th IRL)  **SF** Richard Jefferson (From 2001, 7th pick, 13th IRL)  **SG** Eric Gordon (From 2008, 8th pick, 7th IRL)  **PG** Nate Robinson (From 2005, 9th pick, 21st IRL)  **PG** Darren Collison (From 2009, 10th pick, 21st IRL)  **SG** Jason Terry (From 1999, 11th pick, 10th IRL)  **C** Brad Miller (From 1998, 12th pick, undrafted IRL)  **PF** Boris Diaw (From 2003, 13th pick, 21st IRL)  **SG** Kerry Kittles (From 1996, 14th pick, 8th IRL)  I guessing my starting lineup here would be **PG** Rajon Rondo, **SG** Chauncey Billups, **SF** Richard Jefferson, **PF** Hedo Türkoğlu, and **C** Brad Miller.  Where do you fancy this team finishing if they played in the 00's?  ----  I'll also chime in with a reply or a post on another day of which teams would have which players if they drafted like I did in the '96-'09 timeline, if they played their cards right the legacies could have been different for that generation. Of course, assuming all the lottery picks were never traded afterwards."
"When you have a Kevin Durant, isos work. KD can pretty much get a bucket against anyone in the NBA.  Problem is what happens when you don't have a Kevin Durant or even a Russell Westbrook"
"&gt;Every single player in the nba has natural talent if  To be honest, the only natural talent is having extraordinary genes and being over 6'4. According to the  2010 US Census, only 2.7% of men between the ages of 20-29 were above 6'3 in 2007-2008. Furthermore, the same table shows 0% of men in the same age range are 6'4 or above, meaning that less than 0.5% of men were over 6'4 for them to list 100% of men being shorter than 6'4.   Source: https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2010/compendia/statab/130ed/tables/11s0205.pdf  I will never believe or support anyone saying natural talent and NBA. It's the biggest contradictory juxtaposition of a pair of words.   As obnoxious and annoying as I find Isaiah Thomas (modern one, not the retired one), for a guy who is listed at 5'9 and had a 46% FG  28.9 PPG 5.9 APG season that is talent to the highest possible level. The guy isn't even a three point shooting whore like steph or Klay, both of which who are significantly taller than IT. The guy managed to average nearly 29 PPG against guys on average 8-10 inches taller than him throughout 76 games.   Soccer players, beasts who are 5'7 (jordia Alba, Messi)) orn at 6'3 (Buffon, vidic)  NFL, greats at 5'6 (Darren sproles) or 6'4 (brady)  UFC, 5'10 (Khabib and dc), 6'4 (jon Jones)  Unpopular personal opinion: NBA is a bullshit competitive sport. The biggest and most significant advantage in the game is height, which is an uncontrollable factor. This automatically creates  an extreme gatekeeper affect  where only the top 0.5% height males are the only population who have a chance of even pursuing the game with a serious chance.  Obviously, some PGs are shorter like cp3 being 6'0, but his talent and skills are incredibly rare as are IT's (during his last yr in Boston). Aside from that, Steph, Russell Westbrook, and Damian are all 6'3 for reference of other elite PGs, making them in the top 1% for height...  "

"Thats just looking at the positive. How is that Cowherdish?   A Cowherd take would be like, ""You know what I believe happened? I think that John Wall purposefully injured himself in an attempt to just chill at home with his family. He came into the season looking out of shape, so he clearly isn't a hard worker. He already signed his contract and will just relax at home for the next 2 years while the Wizards tank. You know, this is why Lebron is the greatest of all time. He would never even think of doing something like that. He is a great father, always there for his family, built a school, and he would never mail in a single game, scratch a single minute of gameplay, much less a season. And that's why I think that Russell Westbrook should get stoned in the streets."""

"On one, I completely disagree, so good job. You're looking at a guy who has played 17 games in one and a half seasons. Then gets a fairly problematic diagnoses on top of it all. If he ends up requiring surgery (a fairly remote possibility admittedly) then it could potentially be out for another two years between all the rehab, other tried methods of treatment, the surgery, the surgery recovery, and then rehabbing shoulder, and adjusting his form.  I'll admit him coming back sooner and not requiring surgery is probably the more distinct possibility. Even still you're looking at a guy going on two years with very few minutes and what is rapidly becoming a questionable upside. Sure, he could develop into an excellent player. I can 100% accept that scenario occurring.   You're still looking at the 2019/2020 season before he can put in significant time. Then you're looking at a potential adjustment period. All for a guy who still might not pan out.  I think the 76ers were really, really smart with this trade. Fultz was seeing a rapid reduction in value. He still maintains the, ""what if"" factor. If the 76ers hold onto him and his injury woes continue, he goes from, ""what if"" to bust fairly quickly. I think they got the better part of a trade. Getting either a second round and a late first, or three second rounders. I also think the Magic is a much, much better fit for Markeze Fultz as he currently stands than the 76ers. Magic probably aren't looking to make a title run in the immediate future. So, virtually any adjustment period he has to go through will be cushioned by as many minutes as he needs, and virtually no competition for his spot. Whereas in Philly he was going to be competing with Jimmy Butler, an already established player, for minutes. Which, great case scenario, he ends up as good as and one of the two players is happy with less minutes and coming off the bench. Concessions he doesn't have to make with the Magic.   Hopefully you're right, and we will see Fultz become an amazing player, but looking at everything I think the deck is stacked against him. I don't think MIP to MVP has happened yet (could be wrong going mostly off memory for that one). Though Giannas might pop that top this very year.   On two, get the fuck outta here! Markeze Fultz 5 years be an MVP Westbrook not amazing. Two triple double season averages. Potentially on course to do it a third time. Broke the record for most triple doubles in a single season. Potentially tying Wilt Chamberlain's record in this next game. You might not care about triple doubles, but the rest of the world  with one of those whatchamacallits... oh yeah, functioning brains, does! Your calling Fultz the second coming of Christ, but let me tell you, he's already come back and his name is Russell Westbrook. He drug the Thunder to the playoffs in 2016/2017. You're calling for Fultz to win MVP in the next five years, Russ has already won it. The man has literally broke records people thought couldn't be broken. Records that were made in a bygone era of basketball. "

"I agree that it is a big deal, but there is some underlying context that causes people to be less appreciative of it than they would be otherwise.     He has 2 of the top 4 highest usage seasons EVER (including the #1 spot by a solid margin on that record setting season).  Almost hitting 42% usage is *mind boggling*.      It also gets downplayed (somewhat understandably) because he was getting it while being 339 out of 486 active NBA players in eFG%, had the second most turnovers in league history, and getting ~80% of his rebounds because his teammates let him (only 22% of his rebounds were contested, while the next lowest in top 10 rebounds was 38%, with a high of 49%).   The sum of the above is that people had a strong argument that he was stat padding to arrive at those arbitrary thresholds, rather than arriving at them naturally.    This opinion was further reinforced when people would see high(low?)lights of him making the clearly wrong basketball play in order to log another rebound or assist.  It was particularly notable when his opponents [started criticizing him for chasing stats at the expense of his team](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/suns-players-say-russell-westbrook-was-chasing-stats-during-thunders-blowout-loss-040817).

"Russell Westbrook and KG's seasons are widely regarded as two of the most impressive individual seasons of all time. If Giannis has one of those types of seasons it should be talked about. Westbrook obviously got talk for averaging a triple-double, and KG for the same reason as I'm citing for Giannis.   As a Spurs fan, I'm sure you're accustomed to this particular KG season, as its often cited when people say KG a better peak than Duncan argument."
"I've said this since his MVP year, but if Russell Westbrook ever had the equivalent of JR Smith, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving on his team, his ""hero ball"" would be regarded as genius-level point guard play just like LeBron James. LeBron always had HOF shooters on both his Miami and Cleveland teams, which is why his ball-hogging is considered GOAT status."
He is and Russell Westbrook might be one of the best all around players ever too. Do you think Russ is?

Russell Westbrook after All Star Break: I'mma be MVP
RUSSELL WESTBROOK
It became evident to hardcore Thunder fans after the 2012 Finals loss to the Miami Heat that Scott Brooks was average. Russell Westbrook and KD loved him and that’s honestly the reason why he maintained that role. Almost every loss could be attributed to:  A. Nothing but KD or RW pick n rolls on 99% of plays.  B. Inability to draw up/run plays out of timeouts or in late game situations.  KD and Russell willed those teams to the playoffs every season on individual talent for the most part.
I can think of one note able [instance](https://makeagif.com/gif/russell-westbrook-threatens-steven-adams-with-death-stare-after-he-ignores-his-fist-pump-P6igxE)  of a teammate not high fiving someone after a free throw 
He was like that times Russell Westbrook  
https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/4/26/15431112/russell-westbrook-rockets-thunder-lineups-2017   Thunder actually outscored the rockets anytime russ was on the floor. They only took leads or got ahead while russ was sitting. 
"That year was and always will be different, because Harden and Russell Westbrook have very similar statlines. WB averages like 31/10/19 and Harden averages 29/8/11. This year his stats are clearly surperior, in many ways. Some ways they are not, but there is a clear difference"
*2016-2017 Russell Westbrook has entered the chat*
"Russell Westbrook is only taking a step back to give PG space to operate. he is *by all means* a superstar and a winning one at that. he and Harden get similar levels of hate for their volume shooting and shot selection but what are they supposed to do when they lack the teammates to help carry the scoring load? now that Westbrook finally has help and he can focus on rebounding, facilitating, and defense (all three of which he's fantastic at if he can focus, as now) he's *not* a superstar? one-fourth of *all* 50-point triple doubles in history belong to Russell Westbrook. that 2016-17 OKC team doesn't go anywhere near 15 wins without him. RWB is a HOF lock someday and you should see that."
Russell Westbrook III has developed an amazing relationship with Paul Clifton Anthony George which has caused the latter to remain a professional basketball player with the Oklahoma City Thunder. 
"I guess Russell Westbrook is better than curry because he averages triple doubles right? And harden is the best player in the league since he’s averaging the most points stat wise??  Stats ain’t everything, Chief"

Let's dispel this fiction once and for all that Russell Westbrook doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing; he's undergoing a systematic effort to boost his triple double numbers.
I hate Russell Westbrook in crunch time. Why not give the ball to Paul George. Such a stupid shot 
"Clearly Westbrook missed the three so he could have a chance to get his 12th triple double in OT, Russell playing 5-D chess. "
"Russell ""I Guess I Got My Swagga Back"" Westbrook"
"KEVIN FUCKIN DURANT  Guards: Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Klay Thompson  Forward: Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka, Draymond Green, Andre Igoudala  Center: DeMarcus Cousins, Steven Adams, Kendrick Perkins  Coach: Steve Kerr"
I think Russell Westbrook is the perfect name for Russell Westbrook. It's even got a triple-double in it.
"PG's in the West:  Jamal Murray  Stephen Curry  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Jeff Teague  Jrue Holiday  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  De'Aaron Fox  PG's in the East:  Trae Young  Kyrie Irving  Kemba Walker  Eric Bledsoe  Kyle Lowry  I just went across the teams at the top of this subreddit and mentioned the PG's who I thought were decent. Lonzo won't stop these guys, but he'll definitely make their jobs harder. Considering no one aside from Ingram seems to have the speed and want to keep up with guards, we desperately need Lonzo back. He doesn't make us one of the absolute best teams in the league, but a healthy Laker team probably gets home court in the playoffs.  "
" Perkins has an interesting case:  12 Man Squad:  PG: Russell Westbrook/Rajon Rondo,  SG: James Harden/Ray Allen/Dwayne Wade.  SF: Lebron James/Kevin Durant/Paul Pierce.  PF: Kevin Garnett/Kevin Love,  C: Anthony Davis/Serge Ibaka  Other players he’s played with: Jrue Holiday, Derrick Rose, Kyrie Irving, Brian Scalabrine.  "
"OKLAHOMA CITY — Look, Raymond Felton gets it.  He’s been on the other side of the Russell Westbrook experience. Before they were Thunder teammates, Felton saw Westbrook scowl his way through games and stare down opponents and bark at the other team’s bench. Felton sees why it might bug you, understands why teammate Paul George says that when you see Westbrook as an opponent, “you think of an asshole.”  It’s not hard for Felton to grasp why rivals might be rubbed the wrong way, why analysts might be annoyed.  He gets it. But he doesn’t want to hear it.  “Listen, I’m gonna go to bat for this guy 100 percent, anytime, any day,” Felton said. “And anybody comes to me trying to talk shit about him, they’re gonna have to take that elsewhere. Because I’m gonna shut it down, and I’m probably gonna go at them right there in their face.”  In a league that is hyper-analyzed, where every play is parsed and each star player picked apart, Westbrook’s is perhaps the most polarizing presence. Are all those triple-doubles representative of a wide-ranging impact on winning, or are they stat-padding for personal glory? Does he elevate teammates with his play, or does his ball-dominant style push them away?  And in this, Westbrook’s most confounding great season yet, a debate rages: Are all those shots he takes—and misses—offsetting the undeniable good he does for a team he’s helped lead to third place in the Western Conference?  They are mostly fair points to debate. But Westbrook’s teammates will tell you that the product of this over-analysis is that their point guard has become under-appreciated.  “One hundred percent,” rookie Hamidou Diallo said. “People take it for granted, what he’s doing.”  Two years ago, Westbrook won the NBA’s Most Valuable Player award, accomplishing a feat that the league previously thought it might never see again. He averaged 31.6 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists, becoming just the second player in NBA history— and the first since Oscar Robertson in 1961-62—to average double-digits in all three categories.  The season-long triple double spurred a league-wide freakout. Fans stared at Westbrook’s stat line on scoreboards across the NBA. In Brooklyn, a standing ovation followed a triple-double. When he completed his 42nd of the season in Denver—breaking Robertson’s single-season triple-double record—the road crowd roared. They did it again later that afternoon when Westbrook beat the buzzer with a game-winning 3-pointer.  It had knocked the Nuggets out of playoff contention.  There were triple-double truthers, too, those who claimed Westbrook gamed the system, padded his stats to chase a place in history. As so much about Westbrook does, it sparked a spirited debate that raged all season. Then last season he went and averaged a triple-double again. He’s doing it again right now, entering the final 25 games of the season averaging 21.7 points, 11.2 rebounds and 11.2 assists  “It’s just special that he can do it on a nightly basis,” George said. “And it’s not like he’s going for it. It just — it happens. It’s just the way he plays. He rebounds the best at his position, he passes it the best at his position and he scores the ball easily. So it just happens. His print on the game is a walking triple-double.”  It’s become so commonplace as to barely merit marvel.  Westbrook’s record-setting streak of 11 straight triple-doubles and counting—snapping Wilt Chamberlain’s 51-year-old mark of nine in a row—has again drawn attention to his knack for racking up numbers. Still, it’s been a relative novelty compared to the fervent coverage that came with his 2016-17 triple-double pursuits.  Late-game heroics like the Denver game-winner probably clinched Westbrook’s MVP two years ago, but triple-doubles got him into the conversation. This season’s run won’t get him anywhere near the discussion, and given the shooting struggles, that’s reasonable.  Westbrook is shooting 41.7 percent from the floor, worst since his 2008-09 rookie season, and 24.9 percent from 3-point range, lowest since 2009-10. Those numbers are a more-than-fair fixation. No player in the NBA is shooting more 3-pointers per game than Westbrook’s 4.7 while making fewer.  But as a reminder, he also is averaging a triple-double.  Westbrook is attempting to do something for a third consecutive season that only one other player has done even once. He’s a run of consecutive stat-stuffing games that’s never been matched, and it’s something of a footnote.   “Nobody in the league is out here doing that. And nobody talks about that, which is fine,” Felton said. “Everybody want to talk about ‘He’s not shooting it well,’ or ‘He’s not doing that.’ But that’s not affecting us. We still need him to shoot the ball to keep teams honest, and on top of that, he’s still getting a triple-double.”  As he does it, he’s engineering an offense that, after a sluggish start, has roared to life.  Since Jan. 1, Oklahoma City is averaging 114.4 points per 100 possessions, seventh-best in the NBA. Despite Westbrook’s shooting woes, the Thunder in that span are the NBA’s second-best 3-point shooting team at 40 percent. And Westbrook, long questioned for his ability to make teammates better, is running the point in a starting lineup where the other four players—George, Terrance Ferguson, Jerami Grant and Steven Adams—all are having career years.  “I think if you’re playing with Russell Westbrook, you love him,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. “One, because you get to know him as a person. And two, the sacrifices he makes in relationships with those guys. All his relationships are important.”  George, in his second season in Oklahoma City, has emerged as the Thunder’s best player, mounting a legitimate assault on the MVP award. Westbrook has embraced George’s candidacy, and stressed the importance of keeping George playing at his aggressive best.  When Ferguson was struggling with his shot early this season, it was Westbrook who not only encouraged him to keep shooting, but met him for a postgame chat to talk through his struggles. When the Thunder signed G League players Richard Solomon and Scotty Hopson to 10-day contracts last week, Westbrook spent time with them at a shootaround in New Orleans helping them acclimate.  Those are the valuable things outsiders don’t see, Donovan said. But there’s plenty to spot on the court.  “I think the whole triple-double thing really speaks to his ability and greatness as a player to impact the game in so many different ways,” Donovan said. “He can do it without scoring. He can do it by rebounding, starting the break, getting out in transition, finding guys for shots. I think that’s what makes him so unique and special as a point guard.”  Not everyone sees it that way. And that seems not to bother Westbrook. Though he is at the center of as much debate as ever—about his shot selection and shooting percentages, about his commitment to winning vs. stacking stats—Westbrook insists that tuning it out comes naturally.  “I’ve been blessed with the talent not to give a fuck, and I don’t,” Westbrook said. “Regardless of what happens, it doesn’t change the way I live. It doesn’t change the way I think. It doesn’t change anything.”  Pump him full of praise or rip him to shreds, Westbrook said, and “I’m gonna give you the same response.”  And maybe in that sense Westbrook doesn’t do himself any favors. His game invites critique. He dominates the ball, but he can dominate a game. His decision making can flip in a blink from baffling to brilliant. He can blow your mind or make you scratch your head, sometimes in the same quarter.  But he’s also a statistical wonder whose Thunder teams are 103-25 when he records a triple-double.  Felton admits that Westbrook’s on-court intensity and media demeanor don’t always win him friends. He understands that there’s “a lot of hate out there” for his teammate. He doesn’t know if that makes outsiders overlook Westbrook’s accomplishments. Felton only knows it’s unlikely to change. He’s OK with that.   “It might hurt the outside image, to people that don’t know him,” Felton said. “But he’s not fake. He’s gonna be who he is 24/7. No matter what. ‘Oh, the camera’s on, so I’m gonna be this different person?’ That’s not him. That’ll never be him. That’s what makes him Russell Westbrook.” "
"Ya. The Freak is so far ahead of both Harden and PG in my opinion, PG for DPY as of right now. And about that OKC upsetting GSW.....unless Russell finds his shot in the second half of the season, I still don't think we can beat them 4 times over the span of 7 games.   I still think that a healthy Rockets have the best chance at beating GSW (as of right now).   The Thunder have a ton of untapped potential with Westbrook (Even if he is averaging a triple double, his shot has somehow left him) and if he finds it, the Thunder really have a shot at beating GSW. If he doesn't, I'm all in on the Bucks beating them. "
KD comes close  PG: Stephen Curry\ Russell Westbrook SG: James Harden/Klay Thompson SF: Kevin Durant/ ? PF: Draymond Green/ Serge Ibaka C: Demarcus Cousins/ Steven Adams 
"imagine if OKC kept kevin durant, russell westbrook, james harden and nick collison together?"
"Stephen Curry is not a cool name at all, it just feels that way because you mentally associate it with the Stephster. An accountant named Demar Derozan would still have a cool name, an accountant named Steph Curry is boring. Same goes for Paul George (snore). Russell Westbrook is a cool name tho, it sounds like an investment bank or something"
Russell Westbrook
"It's been said before but the cooler your name the greater the chances of you succeeding in this league.  Which of the current star players doesn't have cool name?  Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, etc. etc.  Even Paul ""two first names"" George has a name that just rolls off the tongue and makes a cool abbreviation."
"Wilt averaged 50 PPG one season, was criticized in the papers for being a ball hog, then led the league in assists the next season. Wilt has faster a 40 dash than Russell freaking Westbrook and could've been an Olympic athlete while being the most physically dominating player in the league. Wilt is a better basketball player than Lebron James"
"No way bro.  Jordan absolutely dominated his era. In his prime NO ONE ELSE ATE. No one. 6 full seasons. 6 rings. 6 FMVP. should have been 6 MVP's and he proved it by destroyed the 2 'fake' MVP's in the Finals in Malone and Barkley.  Lebron is AMAZING. But the fact is many other Superstars won during his prime. Dirk, Kobe, KD, Duncan, Kawhi, and Steph. Lebron simply has not dominated his era like Jordan and Russell have.  Impact on the court? That's more about system then anything else. Look at the impact Westbrook had on the court in 2016/2017.  And Harden this year. That is about the system being run. Lebron ran a similiar system of ball domination during his best statistical seasons. But what use are those pretty Harden/Westbrook numbers if it does not mean winning at the highest level. We can say the same thing about Lebron to a lesser extent.  "
Man the shots of KD and Russell Westbrook smiling and hugging at the All-Star game bring me genuine happiness

Picked OKC because of Russell Westbrook.. For me he as a person is an inspiration as he takes his job very seriously and doesn't take shit from no one. I inherited the KD hate from the days their drama was all over the news. 
Most people i know are strictly laker fans but I do know one guy who mainly roots for Russell Westbrook. 
"Nikola Jokic, Kevin Durant, James Harden, obviously Chris Paul, LeBron James, Mike Conley, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, Nikola Vucevic, obviously Kyle Lowry and obviously John Wall."
"I'd like to take a moment, on this day, to thank Kevin   ""The Servant"" Durant for leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder on July 4th, 2016. Not for going to the Flubs, but for leaving. The Bitch is all numbers, especially his favorite number, 2nd, and him leaving gave Russell Westbrook an opportunity to pursue history. Remember all of our 4th quarter meltdowns last year? It's because Russ would always defer to Skin n Bones. Look at Russ's clutchtime stats this year, it's remarkable. Little Nipples makes history by taking the hardest road, Russell ""King of the Prarie"" Westbrook makes history by breaking a 55 year old record that may never be broken again. Kevin is cursed, it's why he got injured, and now Steph is injured, he'll come up second again this year. And to top it all off Trump takes away our Szechuan sauce, damn. So thank you Mr. Durant, for being the real MVP, the real Ms. Durant, for getting your unclutch ass outta town.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Another tough one :  Wilt Chamberlain  Jerry West  Tiny Archibald  James Harden  Russell Westbrook
"&gt; ""The whole situation is quite perplexing, but I just don't see how Russell Westbrook is a good basketball player,"" said Colin Cowherd.  Lmfao"
"https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/  &gt;Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  &gt;That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  &gt;After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years.  "
"He still had huge games in big moments. In 2012 Game 4 against the Lakers, Kobe scored 38 points. You know who matched him for the Thunder? Russell Westbrook with 37 points (and yes he was more efficient than both Kobe and Durant). In Game 5 of that series to close it out Russ again led the Thunder in scoring and efficiency.  In Game 4 of the 2012 Finals, Westbrook had 43 points again leading the Thunder in an important game (yes better efficiency than Durant too).  In 2012, games 1 &amp; 2 against the Mavs,  and games 1, 4, &amp; 5 against the Lakers, Westbrook led the Thunder in points and efficiency.  Without Westbrook Durant lost in 5 games to the Grizzlies in 2013.  "
"I’ll read this but would it have killed you to call him Russell Westbrook, and Russ for short?"
"&gt; Wouldn’t you agree that defensive boards should hold significant weight in regards to DPOY  I disagree with this. Do you consider Russell Westbrook a better defender because he snags a ton of a boards? Despite it's name, I feel like the actual act of a defensive rebound has nothing to do with defense. What happened to make the miss occur leading to the rebound sure, but not the rebound itself."
Russell Westbrook
"&gt; we were testing the All-Star sidebar  Wait, is this why I've only seen Paul George and Russell Westbrook?"
Russell Westbrook ? He’s just not as good.
Embiid and Russ [do not like each other](https://sports.yahoo.com/russell-westbrook-not-seem-eager-playing-star-teammate-joel-embiid-001557789.html). 
&gt; are OKCs box outs distributed pretty evenly among the team?  According to this graph they're not if you include Russell Westbrook lol
"I came to see Russell Westbrook as an outlier, and I was pleased to see my eyes are not biased."
"OKC have the best chance of any team in the West to upset GSW.  They are my team and I really want them to make the finals but even I think it’s a real long shot.  GSW are just too good.  But hey it could happen!  So let’s play that game   I also think if they do get past GSW they will have been hammered in a hard fought series that will potentially leave them fatigued.  I see the Bucks or Boston having better chance than Toronto winning the East, even Philly, but it’s your scenario so let’s run that sim  The starting lineups are actually quite close man for man.  PG and Kawhi have quite similar output at both ends of the court.  Both are genuine superstars who can own a game when needed.  PG is having a slightly better season but come finals time the exp from Kawhi gives him the edge, Lowry and WB are both top 5 playmakers in the league, Russell obviously makes more plays for himself but shot selection is a liability.  In the end a hot Westbrook is a top 5 plater in the league who can absolutely dominate a game.  What Westbrook will we see?  Who knows.  So this matchup is undecided till we see it.   Gasol/Ibaka and Adams are also all quite well matched hard nosed players.  Adams will play at the same level for 48 mins or more if needed so the matchup is fair.  I would not give either of those 3 matchups a nod one way or the other in a final series until we knew what form WB was in.  Pascal is playing at a similar level as Grant this year (don’t let stats tell you the full story) and Ferguson / Green is probably weighted in Greens favour on defence but not enough to swing it any discernible way.   So depth becomes a key element in the series as we have seen in lots of recent final series.  Especially in your shooters.  If Westbrook or PG  start going cold then you need toy backups to be hitting high percentage 3s.  Shroeder and Felton become key assets, both can shoot the lights out when needed.    I don’t think you’re getting the same depth from the Raptors shooters so my pick is OKC in 6 if Westbrook is hot, OKC in 7 if he’s just warm and Toronto in 6 is Westbrook is ice cold "
"I like how you just say “cool” when it comes to Stackhouse averaging 30 PPG in a season. Since 2000, the only players to average 30 PPG in a season are:  Shaquille O’Neal  Allen Iverson  Jerry Stackhouse  Tracy McGrady  Kobe Bryant  Lebron James  Dwyane Wade   Kevin Durant  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Like it or not...that is elite company. Mitchell would be happy to accomplish such a feat. "
Steph is a 3rd. His name is Wardell Stephen Curry III. Same as Westbrook. Russell’s name is Russell Westbrook III. 
"Too early to tell, although I think the fact he's getting a shoe and other deals while IN UTAH, plays in our favor.  What real advantage is there going to LA if he's getting shoes and commercials in Utah?  Utah isn't a massive free agency place, but we've been run pretty damn consistently for the 40 years we've been in Utah being a top 5 winningest franchise in the history of the NBA over that period of time.   We have a great development staff and our front office has shown a knack for finding gems in the rough (Mitchell himself at 13, Gobert at 27, Ingles off waivers, Royce O'Neale off an Euroleague bench) and we helped build Hayward into an All Star from the lanky geek college kid.  If a player wants to live ""The NBA lifestyle"" they probably won't do well here, but a guy like Russell Westbrook who is more family based would thrive in Utah (I'm not saying we're getting Russ, but there's guys who prioritize more than just ""nightlife"" and he was an example) and I think Utah is in position to get a decent name in free agency because the world is smaller than it was in the 90's or even in the DWill era (funny you mention Boozer who we brought in as a Free Agent)   He's only in his second year, so you never know, but Utah's front office is competent and them not making moves to improve the roster are unlikely aside from the other team not wanting to play ball (Conley trade rumors for example)"

"What the hell has Russell Westbrook done this season, inefficient as fuck, lost a lot of athleticism and has the most overrated stat of all time."
Imagine liking Russell Westbrook?!?!?  This post was made by 🔥🔥Cowherd Gang🔥🔥
Why though? Paul George is considered for MVP and he plays with Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook was definitely not the first player to average a triple double. 
"Uh why, because it uses numbers and a graph? Check the actual numbers on NBA.com, take last season for example: Russell Westbrook lead the league in FGA during clutch time with 158. By 10th you reach Spencer Dinwiddie (94 FGA) and by 50th you reach Kent Bazemore (47 FGA). That’s like an 5-10 game sample of data for those players at the absolutely max...of course there is going to be large variance from year to year. The conclusion OP should’ve reached is that there isn’t even close to enough data available to quantify individual player clutchness, not that “there is no such thing as a clutch player”. "
"I was kidding lmao.  I'm just confused as to why he would put Jimmy Butler in the top 15. I don't think he really has been tbqh. In no particular order  Lebron  Kawhi  KD  Harden  Curry  Klay  AD  Giannis  Kyrie  John Wall  Kemba  Joel Embiid  Paul George  Russell Westbrook  Dame   are all better than him. Top 20, maybe, but top 15 is a reach. "
Kawhi is a dog but nobody pushes him around even Caron Butler called him a dog Russell Westbrook is a dog Kobe is a dog 
"I never said it was bad.  I said it was a fucking joke voting him third for mvp.  Russell westbrook is averaging a triple double this year - it would be a joke voting him third for mvp.  Anthony Davis is averaging 29-13 - it would be a joking voting him third for mvp.  I never said James Harden wasn’t good or didn’t have a good season, I am saying voting him that high for mvp that season was an abomination. Him having good stats doesn’t change that. "
"Russell Westbrook doesn't even deserve to be mentioned for All-Defense. There are so many other guards who are actually elite defenders.   Danny Green, Andre Igoudala, Corey Joseph, Kyle Lowry, Patrick Beverly, Jimmy Butler. Even players like Kent Bazemore, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, Tyus Jones, Lonzo Ball and George Hill deserve mentions before Russell Westbrook. He's *barely* a positive on the defensive end. That's not remotely close to ""NBA All-Defense""."
"&gt; Mind you his comments where racist. Nor do they make sense in that way since Russell is of a higher class.  So at best he was gay bashing? If you look at the guy's deleted twitter posts, he seems kinda shady and racist. And westbrook being of a higher class doesn't make him not black. (or gay, but i don't think he is)  &gt; So we got that established, next let's look at the percentage of incidents. Very low. Almost as if it's really a rare and nearly nonexistent issue this day and age.  Apparently it's a recurring issue at Jazz games according to other players  &gt; People here want people banned for any banter, what are fans supposed to do sit there and quietly mumble about the game. So. Exciting  No one wants that. Just don't be racist.   &gt; No it's called fuel the fire and be a man, too many weak ass people enabled by society's infactuaition. You know damn well Russell isnt gonna have a boat to cry on. Sure they have the right to ban fans, every establishment should have that right. But making it this HUGE issue when it's not is ridiculous. Assume their are no consequences? How about this reality, that dude paid Russell west bricks salary. Yah; the whole fan pitted against fans? The nba manufactured all of it. As do most sports, seems like the issue here is yall being weak and not taking it as entertainment which it is.  &gt; There it is. The victim complex. This whole argument is you getting triggered because people are getting in trouble for being racist. It is a huge issue or haven't you noticed? Fans have always been pitted against other fans, what are you talking about? The issue here is racism, which I'm starting to think more and more you condone. "

"Lmfao. When did I mention anyone's race?   &gt;It comes off like well other black people steal so even tho this guy has never stolen we have to treat him like he might.  Not at all. It's like ""well this dude SAID he's gonna rob us but obviously he wouldn't do that because he's his own person and he's never robbed anyone before"".   Let's approach it from the other side:  Why did Russel Westbrook say what he did? He said ""I'll beat your ass, you and your wife"". Are you arguing that Russel was just playing? Did he know those people? Or was he angry about what they said and he wanted to shut them up? And did he intend to do that by instilling *fear* in those people by threatening violence?  Russell Westbrook said what he did, because he knew those people would be in fear, and likely stop their harassment. No other explanation fits his actions. "

I agree.  Not everything is related to race.  Saying that this is racism does a diservice to people who actually suffer from racism. Russell Westbrook is one of the 1% in socioeconomic status.

"You have to prove damages. Unless this guy lost his job and couldn't get a new one and employers were straight up telling him ""were not hiring you because Russell Westbrook got mad at you"" they'd effectively have no case."

So making a blow job joke(on your knees) is racist now? Because Russell Westbrook took it that way? Hilarious
"If you think it's a gay thing and not a racial thing that's your prerogative (I see it differently but w/e), but I am not convinced heckling a player at a sporting event is the same thing as joking around with your homie.   Specifically because Shane Keisel and Russell Westbrook aren't friends, there's no indication that it's a ""joke"" rather than a blatant insult, the revelation of all the shit on this dude's twitter, and the history of racial epithets/other pejoratives thrown at players over the years."

"I'm using my brain.   I don't think the unintelligent dude shouting random shit at Russell Westbrook was thinking to himself ""hmm well slaves back in the day used to be in chains and they were often on their knees when ordered by their masters, so if I say 'Hey Russell get on your knees like you used to' he'll totally understand that I'm referring to slavery"" rather than dude thinking ""hey Russell suck my dick""."
"he didnt actually do anything, he just made some empty threats  russell westbrook is not going to go that guys house and beat him up "
"so what does ""like you used to"" refer to?  the guy is a noted twitter racist. Russell Westbrook, a black man, has said that he felt the comments were racial. An investigation of eyewitness accounts and the dude's twitter feed came to the conclusion that the guy was being racist. (and not to play this card, sorry non-racists of Utah) this was in Utah where many, many players have said they have had racist slurs shouted at them by the fans. All of this, and you're all still going with ""we don't know for sure it was racist!!!""  Really?  Like, really?"

Russell Westbrook haha.  I don't know what he is suing him for (maybe getting him banned from the arena for life?) but [this](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2825273-jazz-fan-shane-keisel-to-file-lawsuit-against-russell-westbrook-after-incident) at least gives some basic information
The answer to both of these questions is Russell Westbrook 
"If you're low enough in the bowl to get into it with Russell Westbrook, chances are you're a particular brand of entitled around here."
so he's gonna try to sue Russell Westbrook and/or the Thunder. Good luck

"Take your head out of the fucking sand.   &gt;Russell Westbrook, one of the N.B.A.’s highest-profile stars, threatened a Utah Jazz fan at a game on Monday night after he said the fan made a “racial” taunt at him, demanding that he “get down on my knees like you used to.”"
"Absolutely not. She should be help accountable for her words and actions. Russell had every right to talk back to her. I just feel like that doesn't excuse him threatening to fuck her up.

"&gt;On Monday night Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook was caught on tape telling a Utah Jazz fan “I’ll (expletive) you up. You and your wife.”  &gt;NBA fans quickly seized on the moment, calling it a bad look and expecting a suspension to come from the league. A suspension may still be on its way for Westbrook, or at least a fine, for the verbal altercation.  &gt;Then Westbrook told his side of the story, saying that the fan had told him to “get down on your knees like you’re used to,” which provoked a response from Westbrook.  &gt;Then people found the fan on social media.  &gt;This morning my colleague Ted Berg wrote a column asking if we know too much about sports. If there was too much information, too deep an understanding of games that are meant to be distractions. He concluded we did not, and (for the most part) knowledge is a good thing.  &gt;This Westbrook incident is another one of those instances where I am glad we have the internet. Fifteen years ago, we would have labeled Russell Westbrook a problem or worse for what he yelled at a fan on Monday night.  &gt;Today, we can (more quickly and easily) learn about the fan, and begin to understand and empathize with, if not exactly condone, what Westbrook did. It took people less than 12 hours to not only figure out who the fan was, but that this fan has a social media presence that [contains racist, violent and xenophobic language](https://twitter.com/AirForceJuan11/status/1105338915706171392). (Warning: The above link contains all of the language just described.)  &gt;For some fans, I imagine this entire episode will be exhausting. Sports used to be simpler, because we were presented with limited viewpoints. We cheered for the home team. Our guys were good guys and the other guys were bad guys. If someone yelled at a fan or griped about a contract, they were a “bad locker room presence” or a “distraction.”  &gt;Did any of that reflect reality? Not really. But things were simpler. Things made sense. Now we have to have a lot of information, at all times, from everywhere. It forces us to think, to hold more than one idea in our heads at one time. We can no longer blindly root. The guy griping about his contract, we now know, is concerned for the longterm future of his health, has a frighteningly quick career on average, and is being squeezed by a team owner worth billions, an owner who is a symbol of the income inequality our nation and world is dealing with.  &gt;The point guard screaming at the fan isn’t just an immature malcontent, especially when the fan [allegedly said something horrible](https://twitter.com/pdpatt/status/1105312142712946688) and has a history that appears to show extremely racist and violent thinking. Not to mention, many of our willingness to condemn Westbrook shows our eagerness to side with the white person, a reflection of implicit racial bias that infects far too much of our country.  &gt;This is all messy. It’s all tough to deal with. It’s easier to just fall back on cliches and long for the good old days when things made sense. We want to root for guys who want to win for the ball club. We don’t want the real world creeping in.  &gt;That’s all understandable, to a degree, but it’s not what it is to be a responsible citizen, or sports fan, in 2019. You have to do the work."
That’s why he’s Russell Westbrook and you’re not
"Ok I understand that but what's the main difference between racism and what's occurring on this sub?   Racism basically is negative stereotyping based on its previous history (what the Fan said to Russell Westbrook)   That's the same shit you're doing to an entire group of people when you're using their history against them, calling them all racists "
"Yeah. That's pretty messed up and Utah and Celtics fans do have a history of being rowdy, racist, and homophobic. I think there's confusion with this specific situation though.   If both parties were of the same race. This would've been a homophobic situation, correct? But because one party is black and the other white. It makes it racial? Why? Because Russell said so? The other party denies it was racial and they both agree that the comment made was homosexual, referencing Westbrook's history of sucking dick. Correct? There's even been a large number of comments and I've even heard it from randoms in person that they think Westbrook is homosexual. It's just something that went around the NBA chatter years ago over the way he dresses. Homophobic, yes.  Also, Westbrook has said homosexual slurs in a game before and has a long long history of losing his temper at players and fans. More than any other player I can think of in recent history.   Whether or not he was motivated by racism is debatable, considering the context of what he said was a homosexual reference.   Whether it's people not having the full context and evidence of the situation. Or they're just going on Russell's word, just because he said so. Why is Russell being deceptive and promoting being a victim of racism and there isn't much discussion over what he said being homosexual. "
"So many people in this thread disparaging Utah fans as racists based on nothing but conjecture.  Pretty sickening that so many of you would just assume that a crowds worth of people are racist based on the actions(or alleged actions) of a few individuals and equating that to the entirety.    Meanwhile Russell Westbrook is caught on tape saying he would assault a fan AND his wife and everybody is letting that go.  Players can't threaten fans.  Players can't attack fans.  Players can't attack fans wives.  If the guy said something repulsive, then yes, he should be thrown out.  Players shouldn't have to be harangued extensively.  But players can't do this to fans; it's a terrible look for the league when one of the best players is threatening to assault a woman for nothing more than likely sitting next to her drunk husband."

"If he wasn't homophobic. He would've responded, in manner similar to ""There's nothing wrong with that."" Instead of referring to a homosexual act as ""that shit"".

That is deceptive and promotes an agenda.  The NBA has report after report of rampant homophobia in the locker room and Russell Westbrook himself has a history of using homophobic slurs."

I've played basketball against D1 players before (low tier D1 school) and these guys were so much faster and more explosive than I am. Those guys made me look like i was moving in slow motion, and Russ would make those guys look like they were moving in slow motion. Just because I (or some other gym bro) can squat and benchpress than Russ doesn't mean i would beat him in a shoving match. The guy jumps 40 plus inches and has like 40 lbs on me.

Meanwhile, he has 72 posts on the sixers subreddit.    Past basketball, though, he's made some interesting claims relating to this.  He posted the same thread twice that anyone who uses the word ""Bruh"" is [unintelligent](https://np.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ayr8g6/if_somebody_begins_a_sentence_with_the_word_bruh/).

"Sure.  [Matt Barnes said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0u9oLTqVsw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=353) he heard a lot of racial slurs in the NBA, especially in Utah.  There's a [bleacher report article from 2008](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/22893-Utah-Jazz-The-Most-Disgusting-Fans-In-The-NBA) that has some examples of racist Jazz fans.  [Stephen Jackson has called out Utah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0pdhbLLBY4) for being the most racist place to play in the NBA.  [There was even an article](https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2018/04/30/commentary-its-sad-but-russell-westbrook-is-right-about-some-jazz-fans/) in the Salt Lake Tribune where a commentator from Utah explained some of the racist/homophobic things he's heard at Jazz home games.  I'm sure there's other incidents I'm forgetting but a lot of former players seem to back the claim that racist/homophobic/other offensive comments are heard often at Utah games. "

"Exactly. We might not know what they said, but a player like Russell Westbrook is getting shit yelled at him by fans at every game on the road for his entire career.   I find it pretty hard to believe that a simple ""Russ"" chant is what made him snap here."

I’m the wife. We’re divorced now. I’m not letting Russell Westbrook murder me.

Russell “Crowd-susher” Westbrook. 
"You're right, I don't like Russell Westbrook BECAUSE he does shit like this. I still think I'm completely right. Also I love the subtle ad-hominem lmao, what's the use in discussing something with someone who argues like a 14 year old"
If that were Russell Westbrook we'd be hearing about how she punched him a d he and Iman had to have a talk. 
"&gt; As you said, knowing Westbrooks history with this it was probably tame.   Yeah but that's canceled out/countered by [Utah fans' history](https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2018/04/30/commentary-its-sad-but-russell-westbrook-is-right-about-some-jazz-fans/).   And five fans did get warnings that their comments were against the Fan Code of Conduct so they obviously weren't just normal tame, mundane stuff. Probably Westbrook is easily triggered by this fanbase because of previous abuse but let's not act like anyone here knows whether the fans were crossing the line or not."

"**DOUBLE WHAMMY EDITION**  *March 16th, 1994*  Joel Embiid is born!(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_W6XREY8Z4)  ----  We are witnessing the rise of the new Shaq. Yall better catch up because this man WILL easily be the best big man in the NBA for years *if* he just manages to stay healthy. I’m not sure how many players I can say this about, but I truly believe Joel Embiid has top 15 all-time potential. His game is just super exciting; he has an incredible [offensive repertoire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6tJa_o6DWg) as well as a knack for [elite rim protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgfkvX21sBM). The man is a [monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdsaT-rpBQ8), and we should not take this moment in history for granted.  Embiid is also [one of the funniest guys in the NBA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05dHRyLL8VU), so if you’re looking to have a good-humored NBA all-star for a son, you might wanna aim for March 16th as the date of birth. In fact he’s so funny that Russell Westbrook allows Embiid to reside in his head free of charge!  [And don’t even think about comparing dong sizes…](https://streamable.com/bhkb) "
Russell Westbrook is the real MVP   League rigged
"A Jazz fan yelled some racist shit at Russell Westbrook on Monday, Westbrook responded verbally saying basically if he said shit like that again he would kick his ass regardless of the fines he would get. The league fined Westbrook 25k, the Jazz banned the fan for life, and released a statement condemning his actions. Then Gail did this before yesterdays game. Jazz fans also set up a GoFundMe to cover Westbrook's fine and donate it to charity. I'm not sure if they ever reached the 25k goal though."

The Thunder contingent leaves the restaurant that night with the impression that Durant will return.  You’re just wrong"
Because they are obsessed with race-baiting. They’re just as bad as any racists. Using minorities’ issues to sell newspapers and divide people. As if they give a shit about Russell Westbrook.   They just pushing division.

"Nobody said they shouldn’t be able to defend themselves? The fuck are you talking about who are you replying to?   Russell Westbrook has less self control because despite every other star getting yelled offensive shit at them, Westbrook is the only one the reacts a decent amount.  That’s all I’m saying  You and your other thunder butt buddy are putting words and claims in my mouth I’ve never even said. "
"I think the problem is there's too much talent in the NBA. We look at Anthony Davis, and think he's this generational talent, but he's really not.  Just going down the standings, the list of superstar talent in the league:  Giannis Antekoumpo, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Bradley Beal, Kevin Love, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Karl Anthony Towns, Lebron James, and then Anthony Davis way down there in the standings.   When you have a superstar class that big, Anthony Davis is only going to impact winning so much, as there is too much talent in the league.  This doesn't even count all the superstars in training that will be on the come up soon like Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum, and Lauri Markannen, or guys like Kemba, Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Lou Williams, Jrue Holiday, etc. that are also as good of what we traditionally think of all stars.  The league is fucking stacked right now, and it's only getting more talented every year."

I'm proud to be Canadian. I'm not asking for subservience, I'm asking for you to not be such a ignorant cunt about all this. If as a fan of Mad Max, I can look up the 1973 oil crisis and what the fuck a Ute is, you can as a fan of the NBA, learn a little bit about the league and the racial tensions that have plagued it since the inception of the NBA. It's a huge part of the story of the NBA, from Bill Russell to Russell Westbrook.

"I saw Russell Westbrook at a grocery store in Oklahoma yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
"This person did something full well knowing the connotations of what they were saying. There is no reason to have patience with racist people, or people who think racism can be used in jest. We're past that as a country. If the person in this video is not, the time for them to change is overdue, and no one else should have to face the drivel that this person spewed. It's not the responsibility of the Utah Jazz, Russell Westbrook, or any other person to educate him. He has to learn on his own."
Westbrook lost his shit over two people. imagine Bill Russell playing in an arena where everyone was saying that type of stuff to him

"You are misquoting her. She said some fans exhibit poor behaviour and forget their manners after she had already condemned this specific guy as a racist who had offended practically everyone involved with Jazz. She had moved on to the larger issue at hand which is how to treat the competition with respect, using an appeal to manners and decency.       It was an excellent speech by the owner, to go with swift decisive action by the president to ban the guy for life, and [a soul searching discussion by the GM] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/03/14/jazz-general-manager-dennis-lindsey-thunder-russell-westbrook/3162787002/), as well as their star player putting out a heartfelt statement. From top to bottom the Jazz has handled this in an exemplary manner, and to be furious about taking a few words out of context is just looking for a reason to be outraged."
"Am I the only one who thinks this wasnt all that great?  Not the though of it, I thought it was brave, noble, and sincere.  Im talking more about her being seemingly out of touch with the actual issue at hand.    The actual issue is that a racist yelled racist remarks at Russell Westbrook.   She spent way too much time talking about how it negatively effects the Jazz organization, fan base, etc.  while never actually apologizing to Westbrook.  Further, her whole thing about using your energy to support the home players instead of heckle opposing players.  Thats just part of the game, part of being a fan, and theres nothing wrong with that.  It turns into a problem when you bring personal shit into it, when it delves into racism or other forms of dehumanization.    I know everyone seems to love this speech because she’s apparently a nice lady and it takes guts to do something like this.  I just think the way she went about it shows that she might be slightly out of touch.    Just my 2 cents.  I expect to get downvoted.  "

"I also think Dwight leaving the Lakers to sign with Houston has gone underrated in terms of how much playing for the Lakers isn't all that it is cracked out to be even though Dwight didn't work out for the Rockets either. Heck, Russell Westbrook and Paul George rather stay in OKC than play in their hometown with the Lakers. I think if this LeBron James to the Lakers thing stays a total disaster, it will for ever hurt the Lakers in terms of attracting stars until they get new ownership."
I never understood why Warrior fans hated Russell so much. They've won the championship the last 2 years but have always felt the need to trash Harden and Westbrook. People even see Curry as the #1 PG in the league.  The insecurity is crazy.

"You know, there are some interesting parallels between Jerry West and Russell Westbrook.   Both were drafted by teams that would be relocated before their rookie seasons began, both were late bloomers physically, both came into the league with questions about being a point or shooting guard, both proved that it didn’t matter because they were just ballers, both made the NBA Finals early in their career, both lost to a legendary dynasty, both saw their co-star small forward leave the team, only to be replaced by a new co-star.

"Bail him out? LeBron led both teams in every statistical category and had multiple clutch plays throughout the series. I know you have a hate boner for Russell Westbrook, but he’s an incredible player and didn’t play much worse than KD in that series. KD severely underperformed and they lost. Don’t act like KD didn’t have help. If they were good enough to go up 3-1, they were good enough to win."
"According to the Jazz, “an investigation through video review and eyewitness accounts” of Keisel’s interaction with the Oklahoma City superstar merited a ban for “excessive and derogatory verbal abuse directed at a player … that violated the NBA Code of Conduct.” from (https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/3/13/18264281/russell-westbrook-utah-jazz-fan-conflict-ban).  The idea being, we don't know what ""excessive and derogatory verbal abuse"" really means, the Jazz or the NBA can justify banning any number of fans for anything that is deemed 'excessive and derogatory.' I'm not saying this to defend the guy at all because I really don't like hecklers, but I've seen people escorted out of stadiums for things that are fairly commonplace in a sports environment. Many fans think there are unwritten rules of heckling, but they can kick you out for a lot.   My point was more about media outlets running with fake tweets before verifying them. I doubt Keisel wins the case, it's hard to prove, but I bet Twitter rolls out some feature to verify identities before they are posted on verified outlet's Twitter/Facebook feeds. "

"SVP asks Patrick Beverley what words comes to mind when he says ""Russell Westbrook."" Pat Bev responds, ""Knees."""
"Russ is a person that escalates those situations, when others would ignore and just play. I don’t think anyone knows for sure what was said. I hate how the franchise and fan base are portrayed and I hate that this fan was being an asshole over the line.  I don’t think players should be subjected to verbal abuse, I expect them to remain professional as best as they can. People make less in an entire year than a guy like Russ makes in one game. I think this makes it easy for fans to have some sort of disconnect from players, not seeing them as a normal person anymore and in the worst cases vilifying them to the point a bad fan would believe the player deserves it. Westbrook seems to overreact and the idiot fan was obviously being over the line stupid. I don’t understand why racism became such a prevalent issue in this. I heard reports of the fan teasing him about ice or heat on his knees, shouting get down on your knees again boy, you better get use to it.  I wonder if this would have been a big situation if the same fan had said this as a fan in a different city or even with a different player as the recipient of the verbal abuse. It was almost a perfect storm of stupidity. Russell was given a light punishment because I assume we would all get extremely angry if we were abused that way and react in a similar way.  Although I’ve had worse done and said to me and never thought to ever say I’d attack a woman or react how Russell did.  I also don’t know what it’s like to be on a court with 20k people against you and some of them trying his best to piss me off and get a reaction from me. I’m sure it’s tough tough. But if anyone’s looking, I’ll trade jobs with any of them."
"I’m not the one calling it racist, Westbrook did and so did the fans surrounding him, and the NBA. If it’s homophobic (which would be odd because Russell is straight), then money to the HRC makes since, but nobody’s calling it a homophobic slur. What is your point? Sounds like you’re getting mad just because you want to prove you’re right or something. "

Except every black NBA player can corroborate Utah being a very racist place to play at. Russell Westbrook is not an isolated incident.
Russell Westbrook is my favorite PG. I love him.
Hot take: Russell Westbrook is a triple-double machine.
"An idiotic Jazz fan made a potentially racist comment toward Westbrook.  Westbrook responded by threatening the fans wife and threatening violence.  The Utah Jazz organization investigated the incident thoroughly and rightly banned the jack*** fan for life. He can no longer attend ANY event in their arena .  The NBA investigated the incident as well and rightly fined Russell Westbrook for vulgar comments and threatening violence against a fan.   A LOT of redditors didn't agree with the fine. But think about it this way.... if you threatened  someone with physical violence while working... how would your boss respond? You would definitely face disciplinary action. No question. Plus, the NBA doesn't want another ""Malice at the Palace"" incident. They had to do something to punish the player in order to avoid possible future player/fan physical altercations."
"Dude, your cake day is also Russell Westbrook day! Cool!"
"What's wrong telling Russell Westbrook to get on his knees? Yeah its an insult, but who gives a shit?  What pisses me off is that Russell Westbrook is saying that it's ""racial"" get the fuck outta here, with that Jussie Smollett victimhood bullshit. "
D'Angelo Russell Westbrook
I mean it's kinda known in the NBA unfortunately that Jazz fans are generally pretty bad  https://www.thenation.com/article/russell-westbrook-utah-jazz-racist-fan/  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/22893-utah-jazz-the-most-disgusting-fans-in-the-nba
"Westbrook tries hard and contributes winning basketball, Russell contributes to winning basketball. TS% is not the only stat that matters lmafo"
"No way, the thunder have Paul George AND Russell Westbrook. That superteam is unbeatable."
"&gt;Maybe Allen adds to his list of rejected All-Stars with a block of Russell Westbrook or Paul George. Or maybe he gets dunked on. He's OK with either; Allen isn't afraid of ending up on YouTube for block attempt gone wrong.  &gt;""Either way, you're going to be on the highlight [when you try to block a dunk],"" Allen says. ""**If you go up and block it, you'll be on the highlight. If you go up and get dunked on, you'll be on the highlight. Just go up and protect the rim.**""  I love this mentality."
"Jokic was thrown out of a game last year for literally no reason. NBA rescinded the technical that ejected him.   Russell Westbrook standing shoulder to shoulder with a referee shouted at Jokic he would ""fuck you up"" and he didn't even get a technical.   There's no consistency in refereeing and no one knows what happens to referees who screw up all the time (except that their union's twitter handle says ~We promise referees get punished~. "
"&gt;Either way, it’s an odd situation especially when you consider superstar players like Kevin Durant, Boogie, Russell Westbrook and others literally scream bad words at refs with no consequence.   There is definitely a different standard for star players. It makes sense since people come to see those player play, but it's still unfair to average players. If this was Lebron or Durant there would be a much bigger outrage.  I recall reading somewhere (don't remember the source) that Iverson once literary screamed ""Fuck you!"" at a ref AFTER receiving a tech and stared him down, like he was darning the ref ti throw him out. And the ref didn't."
This was hard to watch.  But you know what? These people will not ruin the love I have for the game of Basketball and the immense gratitude I have towards Russell Westbrook and all NBA players who give their everything for their teams.

"I mean I keep telling people I think the NFL will be fading in fifty years time, this kind of stuff very well could be one of the main driving forces. If you're an athletic 6'3"" guy do you become a linebacker or try and become the next Russell Westbrook because even if you are elite at your position in the NFL unless that position is QB you won't be making more than a solid starter in the NBA."
"I mean you haven't been to any games, and I've been to 5-10 a year since I was a child, so yea maybe I'd know more than you about this kind of thing?  You think someone sitting courtisde could say some racist shit to Russell Westbrook and not get their ass kicked or ejected?    Of course there's racism all over the place, but specifically at NBA games, and yelling shit like ""boy"" at a superstar, that doesn't happen anywhere near as frequently as a place like SLC, and if it does it's not tolerated for very long by the fans and security.   "
"I'm as mad as anyone that he hurt Russell Westbrook but Beverly isn't a guy who can take plays off. If he doesn't go 110% on defense every single second on the court, he's not in the league. He doesn't make much of an impact on offense, so he damn well better go all out all the time on defense. I'd kill to have Beverly on my team."
Imagine if Russell Westbrook showed up at this man's job every day and harrassed him 
"Man, you guys are dense as fuck. Read the fucking tweet: ""The Utah Jazz have permanently banned from their arena the fan who engaged in altercation with Thunder's Russell Westbrook last night after conducting thorough review of video and eyewitness accounts.""  Sounds like they have the info and banned his ass. You come across stupid as fuck saying this. "
"Well, I was actually in attendance at this game tonight! Crazy stuff.   I can tell you, without a doubt, 100%, I have absolutely no idea what happened here. Every single person in the stadium was confused and literally had no idea what was going on.   It only makes sense that the ref either made a mistake, or there were words exchanged that we can’t see on video. Either way, it’s an odd situation especially when you consider superstar players like Kevin Durant, Boogie, Russell Westbrook and others literally scream bad words at refs with no consequence.   Anyways, that’s my 2 cents. Go Lakers "
"For what cause of action?  Keisel coming into my office: ""I want to sue Russell Westbrook."" Me: ""For what?  What did he do?"" Keisel: ""He yelled at me."" Me: ???  ""GTFOH"""
Haha. Russell Westbrook is completely absolved of his part in this because they found out somebody in the stands called him gay or whatever? Dude threatened to beat up a women in the stands. 
"I know this one is a little out there but here we go. Some Jazz fans might be racist, and some Jazz fans also might not like Russell Westbrook"
"I feel like Jazz fans get especially bold when it comes to Russell Westbrook, and I think that gritty playoff series in 2018 has a lot to do with it"
"I don't know this, I wasn't at the game, but my guess is the guy said ""Get down on your knees like you're used to"" in a very condescending, aggressive way. That alone is too far. It's possible that the way it was said, and the content of what was said could have triggered something in Westbrook based on past experience or something? I'm not going to guess at that. What is important is that Russell was being verbally abused by a white male, in a city where he expressed he's had incidents like this before. It's not unreasonable for him to feel like it's racist, especially since he says he's experienced it there in the past. I was so triggered yesterday but I got to sleep on it, think about it a lot today, smoke some, and I'm really glad Russell said something. I'm disappointed that he said something violent, even though I don't believe he would actually do that to another person or to himself or his family. He has every right to be mad. It could've been handled better, but fuck it. The way he reacted put a huge spotlight on my least favorite thing about the NBA. I hate how shitty some of the Jazz ""fans"" behave. It's so insane. Most people at the games are families (obviously, it's utah), but the bad fans are so bad you guys. Like, they get soooooo mad about nothing. I've had to tell people to calm down multiple times at Jazz games. And then they just feed off each other. Ugh, please know that there are normal people who just wanna cheer for a fucking basketball team.   /rant"
"It’s a response to another person. I said Russell doesn’t need to ever sue anyone. He already gets paid millions. He even gets paid millions for sitting on the bench. His contract allows that. So, if Westbrook has the privilege of making MILLIONS for even not playing, he doesn’t ever need to sue anyone when he’s already making a shit ton of money. "
The Jazz need to ban Russell Westbrook too.
Ban WB lol. Russell Westbrook has twice as many followers on twitter than their Vice President Pence. Westbrook brings in way more for the NBA and society in general than any of these people could hope to fathom
There is not probably one person in that arena besides the owner who has more money than Russell Westbrook 
"A shithead Jazz fan told Russell Westbrook something along the lines of ""get on yer knees boy"" whih resulted in an altercation. His Tweet history made it clear he's an actual racist (though he deleted some to try and hide). He has been permanently shown the door and will be considered trespassing if he returns."
"Like you’re used to is what his teammates said the dude said, not like you used to. But again, the dude is a racist as proven by his twitter account. He’s obviously an idiot. But people unfortunately make jokes about sucking dick with regularity in America. Much like I didn’t know Dennis Rodman would help bring an end to the Korean War or that Kanye and Kim would help bring criminal justice reform, I never knew Russell Westbrook would be the guy who finally made it not okay to tell other people to suck or that they suck. "
Russell Westbrook and Paul George
Lol I wish Russell Westbrook made 100x more money than me
"""on your knees [picking cotton] like you use to""    that's what l immediately thought of when l saw that russell claimed the fan was being racist   this is also for sure not the only thing the fan said, and given this guy's past statements if russ says the fan said something racist that we didn't hear about then l 110% believe westbrook"
"Please don’t lump all Jazz fans in with this asshole. In terms of Jazz fans on reddit all we wanna do is talk about our team, yell about Joe Ingles at people, and come up with stupid names for Gordon Hayward.   Jazz fans have a reputation among players and media as rude and complete disgraces to sports and we are sorry for the ones responsible for that. However, they are a horrible representation for what Jazz fans are usually like, especially the ones on the threads bashing Russ for standing up to this. I fucking hate Russell Westbrook on the court, but I’m glad he’s taking a stand for something that is still a huge issue.   Long story short, Jazz fans love to talk about the Jazz and meme, please don’t let sour grapes ruin Jazz fans as a whole."
That's Russell Westbrook (without Eazy's hair)
Funny that Lebron is under Harden (James - Harden) and Russell under Westbrook (Russell - Westbrook). 
"Russell ""Kingslayer"" Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook (this one will be controversial like him)
Russell Westbrook as a 7 footer with the same athleticism would be a monster. 
"&gt;Based on every starting PG in the league not being as bad as him at that age when it comes to being a point guard.  That's not true though. Rookie seasons (Points/Assists per game) - Collin Sexton: 16.3/2.8 in 31.3 min - De'Aaron Fox: 11.6/4.4 in 27.8 min - Kemba Walker: 12.1/4.4 in 27.2 min - Kyrie Irving: 18.5/5.4 in 30.5 min - Russell Westbrook: 15.3/5.3 in 32.5 min - Steph Curry: 17.5/5.9 in 36.2 min  In terms of TS%, Sexton ranks behind only Steph and Kyrie's rookie years. He's dead last in AST%, which is concerning, but it will improve over time as he becomes more of a leader on the team. His TOV% is close to the best out of these 6 players, on par with Kemba's (although maybe that's a product of low assist attempts). Worst in BPM and VORP but I'd like to see those stats for only post-ASB play, as he revolutionized his shooting game around that time.  Per 36, Sexton is comparable everywhere except for his assists, which are only half the amount that those other players made in their rookie years. But I don't expect Collin to be the next Westbrook or Steph. He's not surrounded by great shooters like some of these other players were - having watched a lot of Cavs game this season, he often makes the potential assist and his teammate misses the shot. I also don't expect him to be out of the league.  &gt;Teams play their rookie guards (pgs and SGS) to develop their playmaking skills.  Which is what this season has been all about, right? Develop sexton, cedi, and pump up the value of other players to acquire assets next year.  &gt;The Cavs gave up on Sexton already and have him off ball They're playing him off ball more for sure to develop his outside shooting, but that certainly doesn't mean they have given up. Check out this highlights video from his most recent game: https://youtu.be/G2p1LAKp4UE?t=142 "
MVP:  Giannis  Harden  George  Jokic  Dame  DPOY:  George  Gobert  Giannis  COTY:  Budenhozer  Rivers  McMillan  ROTY:  Doncic  Young  Bagley   MIP:  Siakim  Russell  Montrezl  All nba 1st team:  Curry - Harden - Giannis - George- Embiid  All nba 2nd team:  Lillard - Westbrook - Durant- Leonard - Jokic  All nba 3rd team:  Kyrie - Kemba - James - Griffin - KAT
"Well with Russell shooting much better since AS break, what you need is for PG and Adams to be healthy going into the playoffs.  Westbrook couldn't have picked a better time to step up:  26/8/10 on 46/35/64 shooting.  Ft% has to come up but I think you can live with the rest.  Larry Bird was before my time but yes obviously I like the Pacers quite a bit as well. If you went through my comment history a few years ago, I totally called Myles Turner becoming an All-Star caliber player. He will only get better."
"I wouldn't call that an unpopular opinion, I'd just call that a matter of perspective. If you wanna isolate just Russell Westbrook and look at his incidents it looks bad, but there are plenty of players who are hyper competitive and are confrontational on court. Joel Embiid, Boogie, Draymond, Rondo, Chris Paul, Tristan Thompson, Rudy Gobbert.  I don't think he's better or any worse than these players. But I don't think that being confrontational on court has a lot to do with you players are perceived in general by other players. As fans our entire perception of these people is through their sport and /r/NBA memes. As players these are guys who know each other personally and have been acquaintances if not friends for years. And they're all basketball players. They understand it's competitive and that people can get chippy in the heat of the moment, but know that doesn't entirely define who they are as a person. I think Russ is respected and liked around the league, and most importantly I think he's a guy people want to play with"
russell westbrook is an amazing player dude   Remember when it was impressive when a player would have a triple double 10 years ago? Remember when it was crazy seeing a PG grab 10 bords  Remember lance leading the league by having 5 triple doubles?  This dude averaged one for 3 years straight 
basically eric bledsoe or russell westbrook
"If anybody in the league not named Russell Westbrook put up these exact stats, there would be no hate towards them. Everyone just wants to drag Westbrook because he’s been averaging triple doubles for years now "
Here's an article about how Westbrook's rebounding helps OKC's offense.  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/ 
"Yeah I could go on about this Ive spent time digging into this collapse because I found it interesting but Ill say several things   1) Paul George had a lot off the court shit that stretch    a) Yeah Ive heard the same about him fucking Roy's wife it was a big deal  b) [There's this: The star gets sullied. George encountered the ugly side of fame when reports surfaced he had impregnated a Miami-based exotic dancer and offered her $1 million dollars for an abortion. Two days later, George solemnly and awkwardly addressed the rumors. ""Uhm. I mean, if and when there's any legal confirmation that I'm the father, I embrace and I'll step up to it. Still being sorted out or whatnot, just ask that you respect my privacy."" George also denied offering money. In the 30 games since the pregnancy rumors came to light, George has averaged 20.2 points on 38.8 percent shooting (35 percent from the 3-point line), 7.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 2.8 turnovers.](The star gets sullied.

Still being sorted out or whatnot, just ask that you respect my privacy."" George also denied offering money. In the 30 games since the pregnancy rumors came to light, George has averaged 20.2 points on 38.8 percent shooting (https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/pacers/2014/04/07/epic-pacers-collapse-chronicled-highs-lows/7436293/)  c) oh [and this](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/pacers/2014/03/24/paul-george-indiana-pacers-catfish-fake/6832323/)  2) Lance was pissed about not being an all star that year and his grumbling about that affected the locker room dynamic.   3) The Danny Granger trade fr the locker room yeah didn't help   4) Roy Hibbert in addition to dealing with his wife cheating on him was also a vocal leader who gave a lot of interesting quotes. So him being affected mentally affected the entire team in a way and him doing things like explicitly not mentioning Lance's name when being asked who he trusted with the ball late in the game in a March interview made the locker room dynamic worse.   5) On court it came down to defense mainly along with the fact that even the first half of the year when they were rolling their offense was merely ok. When your offense has limitations it caps your ceiling really  6) In terms of defense which fell from a 96 def rating pre ASB to 104 post ASB   a) Teams schemed Roy Hibbert. [Everybody knew he dropped into the paint as much as anybody on D](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-nba-abandoned-roy-hibbert/). Here was the key thing [even washed 2017 Hibbert was very good at the shots he contested at the rim](https://on.nba.com/2FvlCiA). But per Cleaning the Glass 2014 was the only season where there was a significant drop off in terms of the % of shots opponents took with him on the court vs off. Translation: he didn't truly deter opponents from going inside he wasn't a Rudy Gobert type presence. And it made him more exploitable   b) It went under the radar but George Hill who was generally a very good defender in Indy was trash that stretch. There were games like vs [Dragic](https://on.nba.com/2U0RdTw) or vs [Lillard](https://on.nba.com/2U5R1T3) he was so bad they had to take him off those guys. When your point of attack defense is so bad everything starts suffering.   Whiel back I looked at their stats during their below average games. I looked specifically at how George hill defended his man those games. Here's what I found   He spent 659 poss these games defending the following: Brandon Knight Kemba Walker Devin Harris Jeff Teague Goran Dragic Dame lillard Steph Curry Mike Conley Tony Parker John Wall Grevis Vasquez and Russell Westbrook  During 659 poss those guards scored at a rate of 34.7 pts/100 poss and on 61% TS. That's trash for perspective only 5 players [in the NBA that season averaged 35+ pts/100 poss](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2014_per_poss.html) he turned anybody he faced that stretch into a super star bascially. Indy's defensive rating was 109 those poss.  "
Any huge center would.  Imagine Embiid but with Russell Westbrook energy level
James Harden 2nd year: 26.7mpg 12.2/4.1/2.1  Giannis 2nd year: 31.4mpg 12.7/6.7/2.6  Russell Westbrook 2nd year: 34.3mpg 16.1/4.9/8.0  Paul George 2nd year: 29.7mpg 12.1/5.6/2.4  Steph Curry 2nd year: 33.6mpg 18.6/3.9/5.8  DeMar DeRozan 2nd year: 34.8mpg 17.2/3.8/1.8  All those guys suck now.
Uh oh Russell Westbrook is going to lose his shit over this and punch your wife.
"How you figure? In 5 years Westbrook and Curry  will be 35. . Kyrie will likely be #1, Simmons will be right there. Lillard and Kemba will be 33, on their way out of top 5 conservation. Deangelo Russell perhaps top 5. Who else?   By the way it’s going , Fox is gonna be on a  very good team. He’s gonna have consistency and playing with the same guys, same coach.   17 and 7 in year 2 means he’s gonna be close to 20 and 10. Already improved his 3pt shot to above replacement where some guys take years.   In 5 years Fox no doubt is gonna be a top 5 PG"
"If you think that you haven't watched any Kings games. De'Aaron Fox is the fastest player in the league since Russell Westbrook pre-injury. He's an insane athlete. Spida has a bigger frame, but in terms of athleticism I'd say if there is a difference it's negligible. "
"yes, this. i was a very good skateboarder when i was younger, for my age, very good. and then i broke my arm. never really accomplished any big trick ever again. skated a bit after that but just lost all passion for it. i did still love it, but mentally i just never ever wanted to feel that pain.   mine was such a freak accident too, simply slipped and landed on my elbow, which caused it to dislocate and the pressure of the dislocation snapped my forearm. had to get a metal plate. to really excel in many sports you need no fear, to throw your body around like Russell Westbrook, but that's hard when you mentally are scared of that pain, and yeah, its that bad. i've had 3 kidney stones, various operations, cut a finger off, you name it, but nothing compared to breaking a bone. "
"I am not, and never have been, Russell Westbrook's #1 fan. I love Russ for staying with us but he makes some boneheaded plays and I've always criticized that. You're the one thinking that every Thunder fan has to be a huge Westbrook fan. Do I love Russ? Absolutely. Is he my favorite player? Hell nah I got Jerami Grant, Paul George, and Kiwi above him and I had KD above him too before he snek'd out of OKC. I legit didn't remember saying to trade Westbrook but to me that's not near as big of a deal as it seems to be to you. So sorry I said to trade your favorite player. I like Westbrook when he's good and I criticize him when he's bad. This is a sport."
So Russell Westbrook is his idol?
Imagine using triple double as a comparison between a  forward and pg not Russell Westbrook lol. And to be fair Luka is a lot like Westbrook in that his stats are pretty padded

"russell westbrook nephew.  kd isnt a leader, thats why he went to the warriors so steph could show him how to win.  kd can score and thaaaaaats about it neph"
Russell Westbrook and Embiid just because I’d love to see the chaos that ensues 
&gt; Russ can't get out of the first round without KD. That's what diminishes his accomplishments. Not not having a championship.  Just out of context. How many times did KD get out of the first round without another All Star as compared to Russell Westbrook? 
"&gt; but the metrics would have you think he's one of the better defenders around.   As for if it ""overvalues"" big men, I think that's an argument to be had but could go either way. Centers are definitely defensive anchors in the PnR/drive/3s dynamic of the game. A bad center makes for a lot of open looks or layups.  That being said, Kyle Anderson, Ben Simmons, Dejounte Murray, and Russell Westbrook are 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 8th in DBPM last season. Lonzo Ball was 14th and Danny Green was 18th. So that's 6 guards in the top 20. So it's not as if only big men get rated with decent DBPM.  This year has been a lot more focused on bigs, though, although Giannis is ranked 1st and Westbrook is 4th. But it's mostly been dominated by big men this season. It's hard to know if this is a bias in the stat  What makes KAT special is that he is able to be decent on defense while also being elite on the offensive end, which a lot of players can't do. He's 7th in offensive win shares as well as at least being somewhere in the OK-ish range for DBPM. When guys like LMA don't get any crap for having a DBPM of only 0.4, the situation is a bit unfair towards KAT, at the very least.  As for Jokic as an example, I'm kinda torn on that. I think he has some very strong suits on the defensive end. His Steal% is rather high for a Center (5th highest Center,) his OREB% is top-20, and his DREB% is 13th. But he's not super mobile or get a ton of blocks either, so it's hard to say. "

"I'm not gonna include KD, because we've been beating that horse for 3 years. But he should always be #1 for everyone.   1. Pat Beverley - I hate dirty players, no matter how good defensively they may be  2. Russell Westbrook - Stat Padding should be a punishable offense, and he has hardly adjusted to being a good #2 after being a leader for 2 years. He chucks up 3s just because everyone else is, and he knows he's not too great at it, but he just keeps doing it.  3. Justise Winslow - another dirty player. Dude stomped on Embiid's face mask.   4. Zaza Pachulia - repeat offender for dirty player. Should be suspended for like half a season. Glad he's on the downturn.  5. Kyrie - You thought you could go without me mentioning a Celtic?

No one has ever done it to this level. He scored 70 and 59 in blowout losses. What's his career high in a win? No one else has ever scored 50 in a 30+ point loss. He is the Russell Westbrook of stat padders.

Russell Westbrook. The hatred I have towards him is enough to put him in top 5.
Savage including Russell Westbrook in that list of “great but could never get it done” when he’s still playing and OKC should be a competitive team (recent form aside) 
I knew Russell Westbrook modeled his game after someone 
"Everyone cries when Russell Westbrook stat pads for rebounds, but no one cares when they put Devin Booker back in with 2 minutes to go in a 30pt blowout just to get 60. Not saying it wasn't petty, and that it didn't make me laugh, but Jesus Christ. No denying Booker is a stud, but also, doesn't need 60, 56 is a damn good game."
And self-awareness if your name is Russell Westbrook 
Tyler Dorsey &gt; Russell Westbrook   #ScoDucks
Tyler Dorsey &gt; Russell Westbrook  #GoDucks
these are the same people that call lebron james the goat and russell westbrook an elite playmaker 
"I'd bandwagon the Bucks. The drive, intensity, work ethic, athleticism, and broke-ass 3 point shooting that drew me to Russell Westbrook is obviously comparable to Giannis.  Those dudes have a lot in common."
"think people are overrating zion. he's the best player in this draft 100% but i dont think he's the best propect since AD. id rather have luka, jjj, KAT, simmons over him as far as prospects go.  he could play sf in the league but with how strong he is plus he's shaky 3 pointer the coach will make him more of a pf. against some matchups he will dominate but unless he's rodman reincarnate he's gonna get out rebounded. he's a pretty good passer but with the amount he's gonna touch the ball i dont think he'll be as good as an average point guard as far as playmaking goes which will hurt the overall team success. i think he'll basically the point forward version of russell westbrook (with less playmaking) which is great but not as good not as good as some poeple think of him.  &amp;#x200B;"
My favorite part of this is your premise is *im a GSW fan pretending to be a bulls fan to make Westbrook jokes*.  Wtf? Who would do that? Did you think that out in your head or did you just start typing without thinking of how stupid that sounds?  If I was a GSW fan I would be asking who Russell Westbrook was because I only start paying attention to games in mid May. 
This is kind of similar to what I have. Ill post mine here   1st team:   Embiid(C) Giannis(F) Durant(F) Harden(G) Curry(G)  2nd team:   Jokic(C) Paul George(F) Blake Griffin(F) Kyrie Irving(G) Dame Lillard(G)   3rd team:  KAT(C) LeBron(F) Kawhi Leonard(F) Bradley Beal(G) Russell Westbrook(G)   My general thoughts   1) I think people take KD for granted and penalize him to an extent partially because they just dont like him. GSW [has a -5.1 net rating when he's not on the court](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01/on-off/2019). Even with their recent run[the Warriors are still only +3.5 net when it's Curry and no KD](https://stats.nba.com/vs/advanced/#!?PlayerID=201939&amp;VsPlayerID=201142). Translation: KD still absolutely makes a major impact on GSW he's not just some luxury and I still think the gap between KD and PG is meaningful offensively.   2) Blake Griffin over LeBron and Kawhi will probably generate some controversy. And honestly I wish Blake's RPM/PIPM were better in terms of advanced metrics having said that   a) I usually dont care as much about missed time as others but it's still not irrelevant   b) It's just comical how much that offense is dependent on him hes [3rd in the NBA in touches](https://on.nba.com/2frBTZ9). Amongst qualifiers [he's 4th in the NBA in terms of % of shots that come with 4 or less on the clock](https://on.nba.com/2Tyr5dg) and 2nd in most [attempts coming with 7-4 on the clock](https://on.nba.com/2TxuXew). For him to be at 58-59% TS on that is really impressive there's just nothing easy for him. Guy like Andre Drummond [his TS% drops 5% when Blake's not on the court](https://stats.nba.com/vs/advanced/#!?PlayerID=203083&amp;VsPlayerID=201933) Reggie Jacksons TS[drops 11% when Blake's not on the court](https://stats.nba.com/vs/advanced/#!?PlayerID=202704&amp;VsPlayerID=201933) Reggie Bullock's TS[dropped 6% without Blake prior to the trade](https://stats.nba.com/vs/advanced/#!?PlayerID=203493&amp;VsPlayerID=201933). so many guys are just so dependent on him. Defensively I dont think Blake is anything great but theyve had a solid defensive rating with him on the court all year and IMO they dont have alot of great wing/perimeter defensive talent either compared to other teams. I get putting LeBron or Kawhi over him I just think Blake has done more
"Been juggling this for a while... I think I have it (at least one that I think is fair).  **FIRST TEAM**  - Giannis Antetokounmpo (F)  - Paul George (F)  - Joel Embiid (C)  - Stephen Curry (G)  - James Harden (G)  **SECOND TEAM**  - Kevin Durant (F)  - Kawhi Leonard (F)  - Nikola Jokic (C)  - Kyrie Irving (G)  - Damian Lillard (G)  **THIRD TEAM**  - Anthony Davis (C)  - LeBron James (F)  - Karl-Anthony Towns (C)  - Bradley Beal (G)  - Russell Westbrook (G)  In summary: I took Embiid over Jokic, gave Beal the 6th guard, and gave AD the other ""forward"" position. I think that he and KAT deserve it (despite all of the former's issues with the trade deadline)."
"Okay, here's my list, in cooperation with Basketball Reference's opinion. From PG to C. No overlapping players here though. No unreasonable out of position players.

"You used a word I actually had to look up and didn't know. Nice.  It's a rival team in our conference, they bandwagon downvote and don't know what it's like to tank or have a losing season. Also, Russell Westbrook is an overrated loudmouth stat-padding chucker."
He also predicted Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love would go to the Lakers. If you make enough predictions some of them are bound to be true.
"Yeah it’s crazy to me. What’s even more crazy to me is how Russell Westbrook single handedly normalized triple doubles. People were going crazy when Lance Stephenson led the league with like 6 triple doubles. Now, that’d be irrelevant. "
I’m finding this hard to believe. Russell Westbrook career stats is already better than Chris Paul and Chris Paul been in the league longer than Russell Westbrook.   What makes Chris Paul career better than Russell Westbrook’s career to you?
What about one of the most polarizing point guards in the league right now that should be added to that list. Russell Westbrook
*Russell Westbrook has entered the chat*
"&gt; ""Wasn't gonna pass to him anyways..."" - Russell Westbrook   LMAO things haven't changed much.  "
Russell westbrook killed the triple double.
"Okay, let's see. I am a HUGE fan of Zion and believe he will be a perennial all-star in the NBA. But he has yet to play in an NBA game. (This list is going off of RIGHT NOW. Not potential. This isn't a trade value list. If it was, he'd be a top 10 asset. This is strictly who is the better basketball player in 2018-2019.)  This year (2018-2019) he wouldn't be better than:      Lebron, Durant, Curry, Harden, Giannis, Davis, Kawhi, Embiid, Paul George, Westbrook, Lillard, Kyrie, Jokic, Karl Anthony Towns, Gobert, Beal, Oladipo, Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Aldridge, Mitchell, Doncic, Klay, Chris Paul, Butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Kemba, Booker, Ayton, Mike Conley, Fox, Lowry, John Wall, Zach LaVine, John Collins, D'Angelo Russell, and Nikola Vucevic.  That is 38. Then you have guys averaging nice numbers and winning in the NBA: Porzingis, Nurkic, Draymond, Ingram, Cousins, Capela, Jamal Murray, McCollum, Horford, Markennen, Bagley, Sabonis, Tatum, Markennen, Middleton, Kevin Love, and Trae Young.      He's probably in the 30-55 range.  Again, I think it's possible. I am going based off of 2018-2019. NOT the future. It is definitely a conversation. I could see him averaging like 20/8/4 next year."
"its kinda scary actually, i still remember how hard she was pushing for lebron to get the mvp during the season russell westbrook averaged a triple double."
C    Serge Ibaka PF  Kevin Durant SF  Paul George SG James Harden PG Russell Westbrook 
"There is definitely weirdness with that guy. I've watched a few videos and appreciated him putting in work with stat analysis about common myths about Russell Westbrook, Lebron vs MJ, etc  But man oh man... He has some weirdness "
"1/5- Jealousy?  Hell no.  If KD had gone to Miami or Boston, he wouldn't have gotten nearly the flak that he did.  And it's not like KD is getting only flak from other fanbases.  I'm a neutral fan and think what he did was weak.  I have a friend who's a Warriors fan and calls KD a ""pussy ass bitch"".    &amp;nbsp;  2 - Did you not read what I wrote after that. Those are the similarities that exist between KD and Average Joe's job.  I mentioned a few differences after that.  Here are a few other differences out of countless others, if you need: Average Joe worries about his paycheck, while KD is getting a max and more than enough for a lifetime.  Average Joe applies to get a job, while nba teams apply to get KD.  Average Joe needs to adapt to wherever he goes, while nba teams will adapt and build around KD.  Average Joe won't have a legacy related to his job that's heavily debated over, while KD will.    &amp;nbsp;  3/4: You really think KD would have left if he had won a championship with OKC?  Also, KD has said multiple times both [publicly](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/kevin-durant-addresses-reports-that-he-left-okc-because-of-russell-westbrook) and [by ""burner""](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/9/19/16335582/kevin-durant-confession-tweets).  OKC's front office did blunder by trading away Harden, but they were far from incompetent.  They built a team that was up 3-1 in the WCF.  KD on his ""burner"" wants to blame the team outside of Russ, but KD was the one who laid eggs in Games 5 and 6.  "

"&gt;I’m not even from America so don’t think that’s “a mindset that’s been drilled into me” buddy  I'm talking about people who join fucking gangs  It never ceases to amaze me how the answer to not get gangs is so fucking simple: give youth an opportunity to get a job, get an education, have some meaning in life other than ""this is where I'm from, this is my area, if anyone encroaches on it I will use violence to solve it"". Look at someone like Lebron, he gets it. He helps his community without glorifying what being in a gang means. Then you have someone like Russell Westbrook, who referenced his 20/20/20 game when talking about Nippsey Hustle because he was a Rollin 60s crip.   You can be proud of where you're from while still distancing yourself from gangs that have claimed the lives of countless young men. Gangs aren't all about violence, but there's no shortage of it, and glorifying the lifestyle and if it's something cool that kids should be proud of is honestly beyond trash."
"I don't think the NBA wants Steph Curry breaking all the records. With his FT%, if he got to the line 10/game, he'd be averaging 36 PPG.

Yes. Truley Russell Westbrook is the worst nba player ever and his 20/20/20 performance is the worst all time. 
"So Russ this year so far has: 1)gotten in a fan's space, then tripped when the 9 year old literally just put his hand on his arm because he was so close, and blamed the dad for being a shitty parent.  2)threatened to beat up a fan and his wife (implying violence against a female, Craig from Friday would be livid)  3)shouted out a gang, a member of which is the primary suspect in the death of Nipsey Hussle.  Weird little angry guy, this Russell Westbrook."
We drafted Michael Beasley over Russell Westbrook.   We didn’t give Wade his Kobe contract and instead paid Whiteside. This is the one that still baffles the shit out of me to this day. 
"k listen up you little shit  I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns. This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"

A lot of greats have flaws. Russell Westbrook deserves so much respect.   He’s made us not care about triple doubles. Do you realize how crazy that would seem five years ago?   Single game triple doubles were given more love five years ago than Westbrook averaging a triple double for an entire season. 
"I'll stand by my point til I hear someone give any semblance of a refutation. Take out the absurd 1.6/5.6 on 3s and he's already down to 18 ppg. Stop chasing meaningless defensive rebounds and actually play D and that rebound number would probably drop but steals, meaningful steals, would probably even increase, instead of the false narrative ""Westbrook plays D now"" that was going around earlier in the year when its really just PG actually playing D and Westbrook gambling his ass off at all costs pursuing the 2 steals per game avg he hasn't had in a couple years.  &amp;#x200B;  Russell Westbrook is fun to watch. Russell Westbrook seems like a cool dude. Russell Westbrook is a stat chaser. I would not want Russell Westbrook on my team if the goal is to win a championship."
"For real lmao. You tell anybody 'hey if you do this thing you'll win 107 out of the first 133 games you do it in"" they're definitely gonna do that. That's over 80% win rate. I can't wait for people to realize how insane Russell Westbrook is years from now. Dude isn't my favorite Thunder player and at times I've felt like he has held the team back, but as an athlete and as an individual NBA player how the fuck do you get much better? His only weakness is perimeter shooting and that's what people roast him on. Gotta find something I guess. "
What other point guard can actually do what Russell Westbrook does? A prime Lonzo might be the closest to get some triple doubles but to average a triple double for 3 season's straight is amazing for someone at 6'3 200 pounds.
Never thought I’d see a Tim’s reference on a post about Russell Westbrook. 
"I love Russell Westbrook. Dude is a class act (from what I know at least) and is honestly a super-freak of nature in regards to his athleticism. Didn’t he almost average a triple double one season?  I want to remind everyone this dude has undergone *knee* surgery for a *torn* muscle and is still playing at this insane level. Just looking at most other players who suffered the same injury, very few have come back to the player they used to be (ex. Russ &amp; Jamal Crawford) and others will never be close to the players after the injury (ex. Derek Rose &amp; Greg Oden).   He is an insane player and I really doubt this is the end, but the real question is...  *WHY NOT BRODIE?*"
I think this has nothing to do with hero ball. Paul George is literally injured right now. His shooting shoulder is not 100%. Russ took the backseat to allow Paul George to score pre all star break and it translate to Paul George becoming a MVP candidate.   Regardless of whether Paul George was going to play with that much intensity on another team or not. Russell Westbrook has been a solid teammate to Paul George. To say Russ makes his teammates bad is a spit to Russ face for all the effort he puts out when all of his starting teammates are averaging CAREER HIGHS.  I mean he is averaging a triple double and keeping up with Paul George in leading the league in steals. But now since Paul George been struggling since after the all star break it is Russ job to be more aggressive and try to get the Thunder wins.
"To everyone saying he's a stat padder, I get it. But you have to realise that a lot of nba players will ""pad their stats"". What Russell Westbrook does is absolutely unheard of. Nobody in the history of the NBA besides Wilt Chamberlin has done this. So regardless of if it's ""statpadding"" or not, how are you not impressed? 99.999% of nba players are incapable of doing what Russell Westbrook just did. Insane.   "
nba hates Westbrook. Sure when he gets a record everyone acts like they liked him but he gets a bad game everyone does a 360. People in this sub and reddit in general are bandwagon pussies who just follow the crowd.  I’m a Russell fan for life and will be even if he goes 0/20 every night. 
Also Russell Westbrook fantasy teams just got a great head start to the championship 
Need a coach that’ll get Westbrook in line. How is the coach ok with Russell taking more shots than PG13 on some of the worst efficiency in the game

Don’t sleep on Russell Westbrook. I know he is still an active player and may not be a top 25 player of all time but 2-3 seasons of Triple Doubles is nothing to joke about.
Not his MVP year but I can find that one for you but here's one from last year:  [Thunder news: OKC has 121.8 offensive rating after Russell Westbrook defensive rebounds](https://clutchpoints.com/thunder-news-okc-121-8-offensive-rating-russell-westbrook-defensive-rebounds/)  
"Quote addressing r/NBA:  &gt;No player has been the subject of more on-court scrutiny over the past few years than Russell Westbrook. Other guys have been maligned for off-court choices (most notably his ex-teammate Kevin Durant), but Westbrook’s wildly variable style of play combined with his penchant for chasing statistical milestones has earned him quite a bit of criticism. His detractors will point to his “empty” triple doubles as proof that we’re all too focused on round numbers and that Westbrook’s third straight season doing something that had previously only been done once in NBA history is somehow a bad thing."
"Quote from article on why they let him grab it:  &gt;The idea of getting the ball to your best player quickly after a defensive rebound is nothing new. In his heyday with the Boston Celtics, Bill Russell would often tip balls to faster teammates, who could get running in transition. Wes Unseld understood the value of a precise outlet pass before we could have ever dreamed of the kind of in-depth statistics we have today. Coaches have long known that transition offense was better than half-court offense, they just didn’t have the statistics to back up their intuition.  &gt;Circling back to Westbrook, the split-seconds Oklahoma City saves by putting the ball in his hands directly off the rim help get them moving that much faster, thus increasing their post-rebound efficiency on the next possession. The very idea that each possession is its own entity and should be treated as such has been mostly debunked by taking a look at what came just before or just after each play. The Thunder have put that principle to use in perhaps the most extreme way possible."
"&gt;Oklahoma City’s offense thrives in transition – they’re ranked in the bottom half of the league in half-court efficiency, yet are able to cobble together an acceptably-strong overall offensive unit due to their volume of transition opportunities. Only the run-and-gun Sacramento Kings get out in transition more often than Oklahoma City, who get nearly one in every five offensive possessions against a scrambling defense. A lot of this has to do with Westbrook, as they run nearly 30 percent more often when he’s on the floor. He’s able to spur the Thunder’s transition attack because of his “rebound hogging” tendencies, and Oklahoma City is better off for it.  &gt;Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  &gt;That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  &gt;After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years.  &gt;Westbrook’s stat-hungry style draws more than its fair share of criticism, but it’s not as if Oklahoma City is hurting their chances of winning in order to get him his numbers. In fact, it’s the exact opposite – going out of their way to get Westbrook as many rebounds as possible has a positive effect on their ensuing offensive possession. With that in mind, it’s no wonder Steven Adams and the rest of the Thunder box out for Westbrook at every available opportunity.  [Article from February](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/2)"
"Why does he have to? Russell is an adult, he can use words to say “It’s not that, the ball just took a few bounces that didn’t go our way” he isn’t being held at gunpoint. NBA players can say whatever they want on the podium, Westbrook chooses to be an ass"
"Okay but he had a future mvp in Russell Westbrook next to him lol. That team was great, when kd left they had to figure out how to make the same team work that was built around kd being the focal scorer, as well as Westbrook. Obviously Paul George cannot fill that role the same way kd can, hes not as good. That doesn’t mean the team he had wasn’t good. "

"*Front page of the Oklahoman*  ""Is Russell Westbrook a fuckin' nerd who isn't even that good""? *story on page 3*"
"The question was: which rookies have caught your attention this year?  *""None,"" Simmons told ESPN. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""*"
Was it Russell Westbrook who was giving dickhead answers one time in an interview and then one reporter baited him such that his one-line response actually answered the question?  Can anyone tell me what I’m thinking of and please send that clip to me?
"Another member of the media who takes shit personally and projects it back onto the players.     *""Westbrook is like soooo frustrated by me and seeething. He is desperate for control. But alas, it is my noble duty and virtue to deliver these questions with the utmost integrity. Whether the hysterical Westbrook answers, Or Nay!, I will remain steadfast.""*      The league will always have guys like Russell who dont like the media. Someone like Russell lives to play basketball at the highest level. It's obvious that is his complete focus professionally and good for him. There are plenty of other players who will make you feel special and wanted out there media guy. Go talk to them. "
"He got a (partial scholarship offer from Stanford)[https://www.google.com/amp/s/basketball.realgm.com/wiretap-amp/242007/Russell-Westbrook-Was-Offered-Partial-Academic-Scholarship-By-Stanford], so probably pretty high.   Also, the disrespect to my man's playmaking."
"They're always Berry I'm pretty sure lol.  Same guy who wrote Mr Unreliable and asked Adams to throw teammates under the bus in 2017.  He gets crap now but he brought it on himself.  There was a story in SI a while ago about Westbrook giving a baby carriage to their sideline reporter even.  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant  &gt;Westbrook will never be a garrulous speaker, but he respected McCaslin’s candor. During the playoffs last spring McCaslin was pregnant, and Westbrook pestered her about when she was starting maternity leave. She didn’t understand why he was so interested. Finally, after a flight from San Antonio to Oklahoma City, Westbrook led McCaslin through the airport parking lot and popped the trunk of his car. Inside was a Maclaren stroller. “He’s more human than people would ever think,” McCaslin says. “He just doesn’t want you to know that.” When McCaslin thanked Nina for picking out the stroller, soon to be occupied by baby Hunter, Westbrook’s wife laughed. “That wasn’t me,” she said. “That was all Russell.”  He treats most of them normally.  Tramel is the boy crying wolf now."
"I don't see how OKC's front office can look down at Harden for liking the ""Titty Bars"" too much and saying that it ruins their image of being ""familiy friendly"" when Russell Westbrook is leading the league in T-fouls and always bitching at the refs.  Little kids don't see Harden going to the bars, but they do see Russ's reactions on the court.  Let me chest bump Klay Thompson on a no call and get suspended..."

What goes on when he goes to the bench; why is Houston so successful and do you sense that they sort of get an energy boost just from him going out of the game?  The easy and obvious answer would be about how Westbrook gives them matchup issues, he plays so hard, he's so unique, he's the motor of the team and the Thunder feed off his energy, etc.  Or you can choose to look at it as he's calling the rest of the Thunder shit.  It's really not that offensive unless you're looking for it to be. Later in this video someone asks why Nene had such a good night. If you wanted to be offended by that you could take it as implying that Adams didn't do a good job against him, but Russ lets that question go and Adams answers."

Russell Westbrook can't lead a team to a championship. It's not his fault his GM wants non-shooting athletic defenders around him. Give the Thunder some shooting and I think they're a championship favorite.

"&gt; What does assists have to do with defense? MVP is best player on both ends of the floor, not just on the offensive end.   Yes because Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, and James Harden are defensive juggernauts. *cmon man*  &amp;#x200B;"

I always thought that Russell Westbrook could use a runner/floater when he is driving to the rim. 
"It's fucking disgusting the level of basketball that's been played the last 20 games.  If Russell Westbrook weren't the awesome human being he is and if he wasn't the heart of OKC sports, I'd have some harsh words for him."
"But he only averages 14.8 minutes per game over his career (~170 games). I'd imagine a good portion of those mpg are garbage time, which will especially throw off per-minute stats. BPM and VORP are both box score stats, which are especially useless defensively IMO, because steals/blocks/rebounds aren't necessarily indicators of a good defender.  According to dBPM, Russell Westbrook is by far the best defensive guard in the league (and the 4th best defensive player overall)."
Nah the numbers dont support that. KD is averaging just a hair more assists now than he did his last few years in OKC. (5.4 vs 5.0)  And that was with Russell Westbrook on his team   And actually it’s the opposite. When KD has high usage people moan and worry he’s ‘messing up the flow’ (until he goes off in the finals and they embrace it)  KD could go anywhere and do his thing
There is no way in hell Russell Westbrook should make the Hall of game.   Maybe the fantasy basketball hall of fame.
"k listen up you little shit  I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant 
"&gt;Russell Westbrook isn’t the 2nd best point guard.  Excuse me, Russell Westbrook is averaging a triple double for the third season in a row. "
Because Paul George isn’t a top 5 player and Russell Westbrook isn’t the 2nd best point guard. 
&gt;Russell Westbrook just singlehandedly lost the Thunders match  did he fuck he was our best player
"Billy was given a fucking dream. Two if not 3 future HOF players in their prime.   Look at what Pop did with players who are fucking nearing 40 and well past their prime. And we're not a hard market to please, if anything we're too loyal. It's so fucking depressing knowing that when Russell and PG leave, we will not be competing for another title for 10-15 years at LEAST.   Wasting Russell Westbrook is just sad. "
Would you say Russell Westbrook is not the leader of OKC?
"“I’m just trying to get back to watching cartoons during the finals, as quickly as possible. Ya know, so I can try to convince KD that I don’t care... but really I’m seething inside.”  - Russell Westbrook"

"Ok question the year that Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Klay Thompson, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, and Russell Westbrook made all NBA over James Harden does that make James Harden not a top 15 player in the league?  Ill answer that for you actually. The answer is no it doesn’t stupid. Just because someone does not get an all NBA selection does not make them automatically not a top 15 player. You’d have to do some real mental gymnastics to tell me that LeBron James, who most likely will not make an All NBA team due to missed games and stuff, is not a top 15 player in the NBA anymore? Paul Pierce definitely was a top 15 player over the course of a decade"
"The ""likable up-and-coming"" phase. Joel was pretty well liked up until last year. He even talked about it in the big ESPN piece they did on him:  &gt;""People love you at the beginning,"" Embiid explains. ""But at some point they're gonna start hating you. LeBron. Russell Westbrook. All the superstars. Even Steph. He's so likable. He does nothing wrong, but some people still hate him. It just comes with the nature of it. I've seen it.  &gt;""I feel like I'm about to go through it. I think it's coming. People always want something new."" [Source](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/21741498/philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid-bringing-team-life)  People seemed pretty indifferent on Simmons until he started talking about the ROY race last year."
"In the context of the subject I'm talking about the here and now because a topic about which players have the best Top 5 Career Shooting stats is inane.  &gt;Volume isn’t really taken into consideration regarding efficiency, or Russell Westbrook would be one of the best shooters in the nba  This is extremely disingenuous. Westbrook is statistically one of the worst shooters of all-time. KD is putting up .512/.536 at twice the volume of Kyrie. Do better."
"Larger sample size, not like kyries stats have gotten any worse in recent years so it doesn’t really matter. Usually when comparing two players you use their career stats for the largest sample size possible unless the conversation specifically states that it be from the current season.   KD takes more shots overall than kyrie as well, so the volume is understandable.  Volume isn’t really taken into consideration regarding efficiency, or Russell Westbrook would be one of the best shooters in the nba."
The way I play~~ed was~~ is unacceptable. - *Russell Westbrook*
"I would argue that kyrie can *also* shoot from anywhere, I’ve never seen kyrie not be able to get his shot off.  Percentages favor kyrie, and I don’t think kyrie struggles to get shots off either.    I don’t see KDs “better shooter because he’s tall” argument having any value.  Russell Westbrook *can* and *does* shoot from everywhere and whenever he wants, but he isn’t more efficient doing it than most other players, so I don’t see why that should be taken into consideration."
"Reality: The Blazers win going away, CJ and Dame have monster games.  ESPN: **WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR RUSSELL WESTBROOK???**  It's fucking comical at this point"
"&gt; I think the thunder would be better off if they kept harden and let Russell walk.  replace Russell with Harden and I think you got a contender. This is a really hot Lebron-caused-Kevin-Love's-depression take but I think Westbrook is too intense. Even though the teammates like him I think his overall ridiculous intensity can cause performance anxiety among his teammates. He isn't as good as Kobe, so at least other players respected Kobe and could count on him to bail them out. Westbrook thinks he is Kobe, and no one dares speaks against him or tells him to tone it down."
"I don't mind it in this instance, though - Russell Westbrook is just a divisive player on this sub and I've tried to ask my questions as impartially as possible, but I knew what I was getting myself into when I posted a thread about him haha."
"Paul George's unfinished business involves getting bounced again in the first round. The whole team is overrated from the moment they acquired PG.   The only way OKC can ever be relevant again, is to trade Russell Westbrook."
"Given how poorly constructed the Thunder are as a team, some of these kinds of moves are really obvious: trap Paul George, bait Russell Westbrook into shooting long jumpers, load up the paint and dare the many Thunder non-shooters to beat the Blazers from beyond the arc.  There just isn't much that Billy Donovan can do to adjust. He just doesn't have the personnel to open upon the floor for his stars consistently enough to win a 7 game series.  I'm surprised Presti still gets away scot-free with not taking any of the blame for the current state of the Thunder right now."
What do the Notre Dame Cathedral and Russell Westbrook have in common?  They both got torched.
If I dressed like Russell Westbrook no one would talk to me            ^(No) ^(one) ^(does) ^(anyway)
"For the entire season, Russell Westbrook hasn’t been very good at making shots.   That is the problem, not anything else.  The difference is in the regular season many were ready to excuse that by pretending his uncontested rebounds were improving the offense or something."
"It's the same anytime there is any thread about Westbrook. His die hard fans who believe he walks on water and can do no wrong. I understand these fans because he was loyal. He stayed in OKC and he clearly cares. I get it.   On the other hand you have the haters who shred the guy if he goes for a 20/20/20 performence.   Then you have the people who want to have honest discussions like your points above. There are so many discussion points with the guy. Why take so many threes when you suck at it? Why be so damned angry all the time?   My rebuttal to the point you made digs right into the core of the paradox that is Russell Westbrook. He is terrible off the ball. I mean, really, really, really bad. When he doesn't control the ball, OKC is usually playing 4 on 4.5. There are no hard cuts, no back door cuts, no running around screens. At best, you see a guy who will poke his nose in to see if he can get a long rebound.   I think the best move is to keep him at PG because I think he would be terrible if he wasn't dominating the ball. I think you have to hope you can get a coach he will listen to who can help him evolve his game. It isn't to late, there is still time. Westbrook is going to want to do it though. I just can't see him switching who he is at this point."
"Why not?  Here's this year's all stars in the west:  James Harden - age 29  Steph Curry - age 31  Damian Lillard - age 28  Russell Westbrook - age 30  Klay Thompson - age 29  Paul George - age 28  Every one of these guards is between age 28-31. In six or so years, when Murray is age 28, around the tail end of his prime, all these guys are going to be 34-37 years old.  It's possible a few are still all stars, but eventually some of these guys are going to stop getting invited to the game.  Murray's gotta compete with the new guard, of course, and is by no means a lock in a west with Booker, Fox, Doncic, and whoever manages to switch conferences (who knows where Ben Simmons will play, for example). But he doesn't have an all-star ceiling in the west? What if he becomes a 40% three point shooter three years from now on 24+ points per game and the Nuggets take the crown from the Warriors as the top team in the West. You don't think he has any shot at Klay Thompson's spot?  The Western Conference is going to look a lot different in 4-7 years (Murray's prime)."
Russell Westbrook won’t win a championship as a starter. Heed my words.
Russell Westbrook just being Russell Westbrook. Chucking machine.
Russell Westbrook is a loser. He will never win a championship until he puts the team first. People forget he had KD and Harden and still couldn’t win.

"When will people (especially Thunder fans) stop blaming everyone but Russell Westbrook?  It's PG's shoulder, Donovan, Roberson's health, but never consistent choke jobs by RW (if they end up losing the series, it'll be two years in a row)  I've never seen a star player be so babied in my entire time watching the NBA"
Uh.... so here's an example....2016 here are the teams so you tell me if it matters:  West: - Anthony Davis - James Harden - Steph Curry - Kevin Durant - Kawhi Leonard - Marc Gasol - Russell Westbrook - Klay Thompson - Gordon Hayward - Draymond Green - DeAndre Jordan - DeMarcus Cousins  East: - DeMar DeRozan - Giannis Aafdsfasfasdfaf - Kyrie Irving - LeBron - Jimmy Butler - Paul George - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Carmelo Anthony - Isaiah Thomas - Kyle Lowry - Paul Millsap  See anything vastly different about these teams?????
"WS/48 is an almost perfect predictor of MVP. The leader in this stat usually wins MVP. Not surprisingly when they deviate from the player leading this, these are the most controversial.  For this decade for example:  * 2010 - MVP Lebron James WS/48 - Lebron James * 2011 - MVP Derrick Rose WS/48 - Lebron James * 2012 - Lebron James / Lebron James * 2013 -  Lebron James / Lebron James * 2014 - Kevin Durant / Kevin Durant * 2015 - Stephen Curry / Stephen Curry * 2016 - Stephen Curry / Stephen Curry * 2017 - Russell Westbrook / Kevin Durant * 2018 - James Harden / James Harden  * 2019 - ???? / Giannis Antekoumpo  James Harden and company do too much whining. He’s a 1x MVP caliber player and they gave it to him the year he earned it.  In 2017, Durant was the best player. It was his first year with the Warriors and he played elite defense in addition to elite offense. Kawhi Leonard was 2nd, and since there was no way they were giving Durant the mvp that year, he would be more deserving than Harden.   Golden State won 67 games that year and Sam Antonio won 61.   This year he didn’t even finish 2nd, Gobert finished 2nd behind his beastly 68 TS%.  Harden is nice and has been Top 5 for most of the last 5 years outside of that one down year, but their constant whining about not getting MVP’s they don’t deserve is getting old. Want to win the MVP? Have an MVP season with excellent stats and team success."
Never underestimate how sensitive thunder fans are about Russell Westbrook
It does but shooting is broad. Shooting is all over the court. A midrange jumpshot is one specific area of the court where Russell Westbrook was at least above average in for a decent period of his prime. Unless he wants to deny that..
Russell Westbrook out here begging god for Fairy God Parents
"But that's just it isn't it? The absurdity of this game we all play? The way things are set up, a large majority of the fans will suffer soul wrenching pain as their teams fail in the climb to the peak of the mountaintop. But why? Why are things set up in this manner? Why do we allow ourselves to become so emotionally connected to something that ultimately doesn't matter, something we cannot control, something that causes us so much pain?  This is a difficult question.  Some people look to institutions for peace. They cling to the back of the titans of the basketball world. You know them, they are the Spurs and the Warriors and the Patriots ""fans"" of the world. True, perhaps these deities grant brief respite from the ills of the sports world, but it is just that: brief. Just as our short time in Seattle slips through our fingers like grains of sand, so too are these false idols ground into dust.  Some believe there is little value in victory, all that matters is to refine the self. True, they seem to hold not loyalties, but a discerning eye begs to differ. They follow the self, the individual. These are the MJ's, Lebron, and Kobe stans of the world. However, this too is but hollow purpose. The wheels of time leave no prisoner to itself and so too will man meet the eternal void as naked and afraid as he entered this world.  Where does that leave us, then? It certainly seems hopeless, does it not? No matter what you do, the end result is the same. Why bother?  That, my friends, is the beauty of it.  If you can stand in the face of cold despair and laugh - truly and earnestly laugh - you can find the true humor within it all. You must revel in the senselessness of it all.  You must imagine Russell Westbrook happy. He is happy because he accepts the punishment assigned to him. To experience first round exit after first round exit for all eternity.  That is what it means to be absurd."
"Oklahoma City Thunder also have no real shooters outside of Paul George, and declining Russell Westbrook is still as terrible as a scorer as he's been all season (even by his standards).  All the Blazers players have to do is load up on Paul George defensively and pack the paint area and bait everyone else into taking jumpers. It's working incredible so far, OKC is 9/60 from three (15 percent) in 2 games so far.  I think this series has really exposed the Thunder's front office as overrated. Sam Presti makes bad trades for overpaid non-difference makers like Carmelo Anthony and Dennis Schroder and gives up valuable picks to obtain them, then stacks his roster with long-armed athletes who can't shoot.  Anyways, predicting the winner of the Blazers/Thunder series before the playoffs began was kind of tough since I have a soft spot for the Thunder, but I'm glad I picked the Blazers to win this series. They've decisively been the better team so far."
"Dude, you’re out of your BIRD if you think the Thunder are “the most spoiled franchise” in the NBA.   It’s just clear to me that Russell Westbrook will never lead this team to a title. In the end, that is the goal.   The moment OKC starts to have a hard time? The moment??? It’s been like this for 3 fucking years bro.   This is like some sink cost fallacy. We need to stick to the losing formula because we’ve put so much into it, it’s gotten us meager success.   Plain and simple, it isn’t working."
I can't believe Russell Westbrook just swept the Tampa Bay Lightning
"Guess so, but if it were me I'd have posted a Russell Westbrook triple-double highlight video with an extra Dawkins title."
I think the expectation people have of Westbrook is MVP Russell Westbrook and that doesn't line up with reality.
"A series featuring Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, Paul Gauge, Anna CJ McCollum. Shocked would be an understatement."
"Russell Westbrook is player that doesn't strike fear on the opponent. Like when the Knicks fear MJ or Kings are terrified of Shaq, or Joakim Noah feigning machismo on LBJ's Heat. Westbrook doesn't have fear factor, where opponents plays messed up hoop when he's on offense."
Russell Westbrook fucking sucks. dude never learns or adjusts his playing style. So goddamn reckless. Been this way for 11 years. Basketball IQ of a peanut. FG% of a janitor.
"Russell Westbrook killed our momentum in the 2nd quarter when he was subbed in. Lazy defense, quick fouls, poor decision making. I’m not even mentioning his scoring, I’ve witnessed all year he’ll have these games. Russell Westbrook basically wasn’t not giving his usual effort. The bench squad lead by Schroeder was doing phenomenal and built OKCs lead but Billy Donovan (nor Scott Brooks) will ever bench Russell Westbrook even when he deserves. Our fans may hate Berry Tramel but he was right about one thing: we’ve given Russell Westbrook the keys to OKC Thunder and people are afraid to tell him he needs to change how he plays."

Russell Westbrook was an MVP candidate of the Thunder so athletic and so angry, he could use his stats to influence the subreddits to create...hype. He had such a knowledge of stat padding, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from rebounding. He became so hyped, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his stats...which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught James Harden everything he knew. Then James knocked him out in the first round. Ironic. He could save others from elimination... but not himself."

"I agree Siakam deserves the award, but I'm saying Russell is not a crazy choice either.  I do believe storylines matter.  It's literally the reason Westbrook has an MVP.  The triple double machine despite being on a sixth seed won an MVP over Harden, who by advanced metrics dominated him, as well as having team success.  Voters are people, and narratives sometimes play a role is all I'm saying."
"To quote NetsDaily:  &gt;In past two seasons, Joel Embiid has had seven flagrants called on him, tied with Russell Westbrook for the most over that span.  You would think that matters to the refs and that they would take that into consideration when determining whether it's a 1 or a 2.  But no.  And immediately following this, Kurucs on the Nets was called with a Flagrant 1 as well for a foul that was significantly softer, so I think a lot of people just had an issue with what seemed like two very disparate flagrants both being 1's.  I think it should have been a flagrant 2, but that being said the Nets were only down 1 after this, and could have been up if Kurucs had controlled himself (his foul, though softer, was *definitely* intentional).  The foul is arguably a moment you can point to as a ""turning point"" when the Nets stopped being in the game and got blown out, but even though I think the Nets chances dramatically improve with a flagrant 2 on Embiid and him kicked out (obviously), they team still had plenty of chances, Kenny should have taken an earlier time out.  I can't blame this on a single bad call, the Nets got outplayed in the 3rd and outcoached."

"It's truly astounding that Russell Westbrook continues launching 3's.  Does he not understand that he's completely fucking his team over when he does it? Does he just not give a fuck?  Does Donovan not have the balls to tell him not to shoot the 3's? If I were Donovan, I'd straight up tell Westbrook to take MAYBE 1-2 3's MAX per game, otherwise he's getting benched. It's absolutely insane that this has continued for years.   Imagine how much more efficient the offense would be if the Thunder didn't have a 29% 3 point shooter jacking up 5.6 3 point attempts per game!!! That's 5.6 entire possessions where they would score more points on average. That's sooo significant!  Insane."

He brought his laptop into the locker room to move quotes directly from the players’ lips to his copy. Mayberry sat in a chair in front of an empty locker. Westbrook saw him and told him the chairs were for players only. “Mayberry got up. But then a funny thing happened. Backup point guard Reggie Jackson took his chair, wheeled it across the locker room, and offered it to Mayberry. Remember that when you wonder why Jackson now plays for the Pistons.”  https://nesn.com/2015/03/reggie-jacksons-kindness-to-reporter-may-have-miffed-russell-westbrook-in-okc/"

"&gt; But the one time he’s actually in —gasp—-a bad mood, all it takes is 1 ‘next question ’ and guess what—-FIRST TAKE. ‘Russell Westbrook mopes thru presser!’  This is of course massively revisionist history. Any player can get a few 'next questions' through if they don't have history of being an asshole to reporters. It only becomes a problem when there's a clear pattern.  And as much as you call the reporters 'clowns' who are out there to hurt the players, miraculously most of them manage to have a professional relationship and realize it's a part of their multi-million dollar job."
"You’d think right!?!? Well ask Russell Westbrook how that’s going. Not with free agency but in general. He OBVIOUSLY hates the reporters’ guts. But he tries to give them their dumbass cliche answers that they almost MAKE you give.   But the one time he’s actually in —gasp—-a bad mood, all it takes is 1 ‘next question ’ and guess what—-FIRST TAKE. ‘Russell Westbrook  mopes thru presser!’  Ask Cam Newton how that works also.   If you have any type personality and for 1 second act normal with these clowns they will use it agaisnt you when you lose.   The only remedy is to be completely neutral and boring  from jump. And that’s hard bc ya know most people come into the league with no expectations and are generally happy to be there."
Russell “T-Mac” Westbrook.  He’s too talented to be this bad in the playoffs. Leadership and self-control is an underrated  skill.
"See and that last sentence is why people don’t respect many journalists, because you get in your feelings and try to tear down professional athletes.  Happened with TO and the HOF, it’ll probably happen with Russell Westbrook after he retires, so thanks for proving his point I guess"

Not sure if this is true as Russell Westbrook plays in OKC and is one of the highest earning athletes from sponsorships in the world. KD will be in Brooklyn its the biggest borough population wise in the city.

"Thunder's Paul George on Russell Westbrook missing more shots than the rest of the team combined: ""That's a bad shot. I don't care what anybody says. That's a bad shot. But, hey, he missed it. That story has been told, that it's a bad shot. You die with that."""
Nice try Russell Westbrook.
"How bout both. Russ was my favorite player, so I brushed the blame from the past two seasons off him.  This year tho, Im watching the game this morning  and I made the hypothesis once OKC was up 105-90, that the win condition was set, and there would be absolutely ZERO reason for OKC to lose this game.  Even factoring Lillard, there was no excuse with only 7min left.  Then CHO-K-C took over to prove me wrong. Flat out choke job by ""little O"" Russ and ""Playoff Bum P"". Every talk show today has a right to bash these two today and for every day until their next playoff game. Russ hasn't been out the first round since 2016. PG hasn't since 2014. Billy Donovan sucks ass and prob should be fired anyways,  but I'm not putting this one on him.   Russell Westbrook and Paul George are chokers."
What do Russell Westbrook &amp; Donald Trump have in common
"Jesus Christ, the double narrative is huge. Other stars will go out and not answer questions, or disrespect the media, and no one cares. They either don’t care or think it’s funny. Russell Westbrook does it and everyone starts calling Russ an asshole smh"

"""Dedicated Russell Westbrook Stays Late After Practice To Miss 100 Extra Shots"" - The Onion"
I watched basketball in ‘17. He was not in that conversation amongst anyone who knows anything about basketball. Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook were well above him.
Russell Westbrook (29%)  John Wall (37%) using last year since he was injured when he’s played this year
"Yeah I said this in a ""fire Donovan"" thread - at what point do we accept that Russell Westbrook is not conducive to a great offense?"
"Hi, my name's Russell Westbrook. Nice to meet you."
"Exactly. It's the same reason people like Al Horford are underrated. It's because stats are overrated. It's all about winning and having a clutch gene. Give me a proven winner like Robert Horry, who may never even get a double double, instead of someone as empty and soulless as Russell Westbrook."
Which one would be Russell Westbrook?
"It think this perfectly shows the type of player he is. I don't know about you but as someone who has been playing team sports since childhood, I appreciate winners. Russell Westbrook is not a winner. It's not in his genes to win. Things like intangibles and leadership are lost on him. He tried to ruin Kevin Durant's career at every turn and by the grace of God Durant was able to expect to a team that plays *the right way*. The answer is simple, he's a trainwreck and needs to be abandoned just like a 2000 Honda that's been in an accident. Trade him for whatever you can get."
&gt;Gotta put Russ (Russell Westbrook) up there because you don't know what you're gonna get from Russ. He can go cold for five games and then you play him and he hit five threes   LOL

Russell Westbrook has the basketball IQ of a stale loaf of bread and it was on full display. Paul George was on fire and he refused to let him close the game. Thats all Westbrook has ever been good at. Stat padding and shooting the Thunder out of games. Only this time around he doesn't have Durant cleaning up his messes.

It’s easy to wonder what if the thunder had player a or player b; point is you’re trying to argue the thunder’s main problem is Russell Westbrook and you know that isn’t true. And AI got to one finals and lost to a historically great team just like Russell did. Not every player is destined for rings. Kyrie is nothing like the other players you mentioned. I’d rather have an MVP and finals participant  Russ than a perpetually injured John Wall and a really underwhelming Ricky Rubio... I don’t see that being very controversial.
Blazers: Russell Westbrook
"I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns.  This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd.  And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist.  I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"
Because he's Russell Westbrook
"The Anti-Westbrook train is leaving Oklahoma at breakneck speed, even faster than the coward Kevin Durant left in the summer of 2016. Russell Westbrook’s reputation amongst, and treatment of, members of the media has reached a zenith just as his team sits on the brink of an early postseason exit, no doubt the fault of several hatchet-faced referees, a pinheaded fanbase, and an old sack of oatmeal named Raymond Felton.  Russell Westbrook has been accused of refusing to answer questions from the media, sometimes refusing to even make eye contact. On behalf of all writers, we can barely look at ourselves in a mirror, so why should Russ have to?  Russell Westbrook is having historically bad post season stats, but it’s hard to be efficient at basketball when your hands are busy carrying Paul George, who injured himself at his second job as the inflatable man at a used car dealership, and with both of his eyes trained on Berry Tramel, who looks like if doing Whippits in the back of a 94 Dodge Ram was a person.  Even Steve Kerr has piled on, calling Westbrook’s actions “dangerous to the league.” But the only danger Steve Kerr is an expert in is getting punched in the face by Michael Jordan.  Does Russell Westbrook have a contractual obligation to cooperate with the media? Maybe, but my cousin had a contractual obligation to stay away from the local high school, and now he’s serving 3 to 5 in county. Free Hambone  Does Russell Westbrook have a moral obligation to cooperate with the media? I’m reminded of the old saying “it takes more muscles to smile than it does to frown.” But only at first! Have you seen what 25 years of sadness does to the human body? My grandma is the unhappiest person I’ve ever met and her face looks like a haunted mask from an Indian burial ground. Anyway. MY POINT IS that Russell Westbrook is a smart, handsome and good player, and I say this not just because I’m a fan, but because I am financially invested in gaining access to Russel Westbrook.  If you’re reading this, Russ, I promise to write fawningly about you (triple doubles are underrated! Stat chasing is good!) unflinchingly about your enemies (Why does Pat Beverley look like he should be selling bean pies on the subway?) and most of all, I promise to never subject you to the Ramsey Bolton-esque torture of ever making direct eye contact. I love you Russ."

He is going to freeze our players much better than him for the length of his contract, refuses to change his game and or be coachable. Switch 34-year-old CP3 with Russ today and the series is headed back to OKC easy"
What exact standards are you putting on a Russell Westbrook? Is Paul George a top ten player? Can you guard a 33 foot step back at the buzzer? You’re criminally underrating a Portland team that is a perennial top 4 seed. This was a 3 vs 6 right ? What point is to be proved? That Russell isn’t the best player in the league? That he isn’t top 5? Is your only agenda to prove he isn’t great? I’m severely confused What EXACTLY is the issue?

"Again, I think you're trying to turn Russell into some kind of martyr here when in reality he's just being an asshole.   You're overthinking this big time. This is not comparable to the BLM movement or voting rights. (both of which are very important.)  Of course there's bad questions, but the NBA and professional sports in general would not exist without journalism. Westbrook is asked the same questions as every other player, so he should be able to handle himself like a professional, like 99% of other players are able to do successfully.   Every one else seems to get along with journalists just fine for 29 other teams"
"29 points on 11-32 shooting in an elimination game, with a triple double.   Ladies and gentlemen, the Russell Westbrook experience."
Westbrook missed his last 6 shots in the 4th. Shot 36% from the field. 5 turnovers. Can we all recognise that Billy Donovan is a shit coach for being complacent towards Westbrook's ineffective playstyle. And then next person to be blamed is Russell Westbrook himself. If I'm the GM I fire Billy Donovan and try to trade Westbrook for a more consistent/less hero ball oriented point guard. Getting rid of westbrook probably lowers the ceiling but raises the floor of the team
This is why Durant left  Russell Westbrook: 29 points 11/31 shooting Paul George: 36 points 14/20 shooting  Replace George with Kevin Durants name and you have a similar statline from years back. And of course Westbrook takes the potential game winning shot instead of feeding PG

RUSSELL WESTBROOK HOLD MA DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK
In press conference Russell Westbrook: Next Season!
"It'll only be an offensive foul on Harden if he's actually kicking the defender which is rarely the case. If he's landing and someone is underneath him then more likely than not it'll be a foul on the defender.   When someone got under him, Steph Curry started falling down on his three point attempts because believe it or not it's safer than landing on someone else's feet. Harden is doing the same thing on plays where he thinks he's at risk of landing on someone. And if you think that he's doing this on every attempt he takes or that he's the only one that even does it, then you're greatly mistaken my friend.   “These plays happen every day,” Kerr said. “I don’t think a game goes by where Jamal Crawford doesn’t flop six times on his 3-point shots. It’s part of the game and I don’t blame them for doing it. Russell Westbrook does it. Everybody does it.”  “I think he[Steph Curry] did flop, I think he does flop, but I think everybody else does, too” Kerr said.  Read through this and apply the same logic to Harden: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1t692c/what_is_steph_currys_deal_with_flopping_every/?st=jv4ed46u&amp;sh=e8c1906c"

"In an appearance on The Bill Simmons Podcast, Bills Simmons of The Ringer and Ryen Russillo of ESPN discussed the possibility that Thunder General Manager Sam Presti could trade the face of the franchise, Russell Westbrook, in the 2019 NBA offseason. With their inability to contend for the NBA championship during his leadership, Russillo believes that it’s time for the Thunder to part ways with Westbrook.  “If I were Presti I wouldn’t make it known publicly, but I think you get a dollar on a dollar for Westbrook right now,” Russillo said, as transcribed by Metro USA.  “What’s the point in OKC? What’s the point of bringing everyone back and having Westbrook as the ring-leader? I understand what he means to Thunder fans. You lost two MVPs and this MVP took your money and wanted to stay home. He decided to stay. But you lost to one rookie scorer in the playoffs last year. Oklahoma City is held hostage to Westbrook in a way that I haven’t seen since Iverson was with the Sixers"
The last guy to say that was Russell Westbrook.
"Nikola ""Russell 'stat padder' Westbrook"" jokic"
The reverse Russell Westbrook
"This would make sense if Harden didn't lose to a Russell Westbrook-less OKC in 2013; lose to 2nd year Dame Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge the following year; lose to a Steph Curry-less Golden State in 2016; and then proceed to choke against the Spurs in 2017 with Kawhi out and J. Simmons being their best player with LaMarcus Aldridge suddenly forgetting how to play in the post.  &amp;#x200B;  Also don't forget Chris Paul carrying him in the second half of Gm. 5 with Harden going 5/21 from the field.  &amp;#x200B;  For someone whose followed his entire career this guy is so overrated it's comical. Nah, he's been the subject of scrutiny because his trash kick-out threes, travelling stepback, in addition to the refs whistle blowing if you touch him after he's released his three, ensure that you can't contest his shots like the rest of the players in the league."
these dogs are the first thing i've seen on a basketball court faster end line to end line than russell westbrook
"What is the point of relation that people have when they keep saying OKC ""underperforms""? They keep ""underperforming"" in comparison to what? Tge team with Kevin Durant in it? Russell Westbrook keeps ""underperforming"" related to what? He's the player he is. He's 30."
*Russell Westbrook has entered the chat.*
Is it just me or does this guy look like Russell Westbrook?
Team only goes as far as Russell Westbrook does. It doesn't matter if you change your coach.
It does more than tarnish it. It is a handicap that helps facilitate it. He is a very good player. But when defences can't even breath near you without picking up fouls it makes it much easier to score. Then add in all those extra points from free throws to pad those numbers.... I equate it to Russell Westbrook state padding for triple doubles. He is a very good player but getting triple doubles not in the flow of the game diminishes the accomplishment.
"you know what? Fuck it. Sam Presti gets paid to know his shit and do the research and has advisers and way more experience than ill ever have. Ill trust his decision. Maybe Billy D isn't that bad and i shouldnt just blindly trust random nobodies off reddit who hate the Thunder and Westbrook anyways.  Its easy for me to blame the coach and blindly agree with whatever statistics and hatred that gets created on here, but i have less of a clue than most of you do, and you guys don't really know anything either other than watching the games and reposting cherry picked stats.  no offense to those who create great OC and know some stuff, but i have never been a GM or head coach or assistant coach or whatever in the NBA and i have no clue what is actually good and working or bad. The Thunder havent made it out of the first round in a while, but we have not been as bad as advertised. Imma just trust Sam Presti on this one and hope he pulls out some of his patented magic and we do better.  Especially on Russell Westbrook day."
"&gt;	Except that isn't what every answer would be. Refs are human, just like players. For every Russell Westbrook ""next question"" there could be a PG ""that was a bad shot"" honest answer. The potential gain is peeling back the curtain for fans and letting them in on a part of the game that they have 0 insight into right now.   Go one step beyond this. The reason the NBA requires players and coaches to do media is to generate headlines and interest in the league. More press attention regarding the players/coaches means more marketability for the NBA. Paul George saying he took a bad shot doesn’t do anything to hurt someone’s interest in the product.   This is not the same for officials. The reaction to the league admitting missed calls is almost universally negative. Just read the replies on these links:  https://twitter.com/officialnbarefs/status/1106040544139059201?s=21   https://twitter.com/officialnbarefs/status/1106010438792347654?s=21   There’s no appreciation for transparency, just ridicule and ridiculous standards and expectations of perfection."
"That’s not what the guy is trying to say with the numbers.... I’m well aware of what happened yesterday. He was trying to say he’s been exactly as inefficient as Russell Westbrook, which is blatantly not true."
"Except that isn't what every answer would be. Refs are human, just like players. For every Russell Westbrook ""next question"" there could be a PG ""that was a bad shot"" honest answer. The potential gain is peeling back the curtain for fans and letting them in on a part of the game that they have 0 insight into right now. Clearly the NBA thinks there's at least SOME value in something like this or else we wouldn't have the L2M report. Those have no impact on game results or a referees ability to do their job either, but they exist. Just take it to the next level. Peeling back the curtain isn't a bad thing."
"The difference is 2 of yours are Kevin Durant and Steph Curry. Two generational talents and MVPs is a big step up from Ben ""no jumpers"" Simmons and Russell ""too many jumpers"" Westbrook."
"Don't think anyone has said this yet, but I believe it's because James Harden has attempted more 3-pointers than Russell Westbrook."
As good as he is we still haven't seen him at his full potential as the only hardship he had to face in his career is playing alongside Russell Westbrook
"People saying Russell Westbrook have me going ""Dude what the fuck"" The going ""Ha, you admitted he's an all time great"""
Russell  ^^^^^^^Westbrook
Russell Westbrook 2019 playoffs:  36.0% FG  32.4% 3P  88.5% FT   James Harden 2019 playoffs:  36.4% FG  32.9% 3P  88.2% FT
"&gt;I also didn't know if this was a well known fact but Russell Westbrook is actually #8 on this all-time list, thanks to his 37.40 ppg playoff run in 2017  Is it really a run if you lose in the first round? We gotta find another word for that, like a jog or a speedwalk."
"Well I can’t speak to the whole team, but as far as Westbrook goes: if the Warriors make it to the Finals again, you can be sure the Russ will be dropping a Snapchat showing that he’s DEFINITELY watching cartoons and NOT grinding his teeth over seeing his former teammate compete for ANOTHER championship. No siree, not Mr. Russell “I’m so humble” Westbrook."
worse than the guy who said Russell Westbrook should not be a starter?
How dare you criticize Russell and / or Westbrook for not being able to shoot worth a fuck!!!
"Thank you so much for your feedback. I'm in complete agreement with you about the triple double. However, instead of looking as it as a stat I'm looking at it as an achievement. When you think of Oscar Robertson first thing that comes to mind is triple double, same with Russell Westbrook. Thus, this has heavily impacted their legacy and where they are viewed upon all time. I agree I rather have someone average 27/8/8 with good shooting numbers and such numbers should equate him to 1st Team NBA, possibly MVP thus he would be rewarded in this system. But averaging a triple double is an achievement in itself and will always be remembered in history."
"Yea man it’s just not a natural shooting motion...you can’t argue that. If the refs know you’re attempting to get fouled EVERY time you take a shot you don’t deserve borderline calls tbf. If harden wants to jump forward on every shot where he’s a taking a STEP BACK three it’s his own flops he should be changing. If he taking a transition three where his body momentum will naturally project him forward it’s a completely different story.  Fact is James harden is looking for a foul on shots his body has no business landing where he does. If your game is reliant and getting calls then you just need to adapt to the refs whether you lie it or not. I give Russell Westbrook a lot of the same criticism, but atleast he gets after it and makes a basketball “move” rather than outright funky stuff harden does to try to bait refs into blowing the whistle 99% of the time."
Don't let Harden and Dubs hate distract you from the fact than Russell Westbrook hasn't gotten past the first round since KD left.
"hey, at least we've moved on from Russell Westbrook now"
russell westbrook
James Harden is generally efficient.  Russell Westbrook is not.
"James ""Russell Westbrook"" Harden"
James Harden is Russell Westbrook with a beard. Change my mind
Giannis “Russell Westbrook “ Antetokounnpo
"That's like saying Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double and therefore he was good. Nobody cares about the raw stats anymore. If you watched the game, you'd know he was shut down. He had 4 baskets in the paint all game. 0 of those baskets were on Horford."
Giannis Antetokounmpo with the Russell Westbrook
... But Russell Westbrook is just too inefficient and Will inevitebly be remember ed as a perrenial loser...
"Russell Westbrook is easily To-pngghnmm hnngggmgmmm r/- aahh NBAggngmmmNOODon't no! Dont! Okay okay he's utter trash, chucks up shots, and a big behemoth of a statpadder who knows nothing about winning basketball... phew"
giannis efficiency in first half was bad... Russell westbrook levels of bad
Russell Westbrook
Uhh..I don't know how that angle makes sense either since people loved Russell Westbrook for it for years. He's only under fire just recently.
"😂😂😂ya’ll goofy ass fanboys Harden gets buckets like russell westbrook bro  Just chucks shit up there and hopes for the best, Hes just a better shooter than westbrook so he gets away with it And he flops and pulls fouls like a 14 year old when his teams losing  Kobe, Jordan, Klay, Wade, Ray Allen, Tracy Mcrady, Vince Carter, Reggie Miller, Iverson, Penny Hardaway.  Id go as far as to say Lou Will is a better shooting guard  for patrick beverly lol  Ya’ll are literally just like OKC with Westbrook. ya’ll gonna be sick and twisted when it happens to you too 😂😂😂😂"
Still don't have as many misses as Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook complains and flops as often if not more than Harden.
They're making Russell Westbrook proud.
Nikola russell westbrook jokic
This entire team is just chucking up Russell Westbrook type shots.
Russell westbrook
"If you watch the Thunder play - and Russell Westbrook take terrible shots - you'll see the negative value in none shooters shooting.  Ben is elite as a switchable defender, a generational passing talent, fantastic inside and spectacular in transition.   His shooting is an issue with his game. But it's a flaw with a lot of players games and it's overstated as a hole in Ben's game by 12 year olds like you who judge basketball players based more on 3p% than their ability to play the actual game."
"So you're thought process is that, in the middle of close games coming down the stretch, Russell Westbrook is kicking out to open teammates for his own assist numbers.   Not that he's trying to win a game.  Not that 3 points are worth more than 2.  Not that Billy Donovans primary coaching scheme is dribble-penetration, and that Russ is there to suck the defense in and create open looks.   You think an 11 year-Max Contract former MVP, with really nothing else to prove besides winning a title, is primarily focused on getting 10 assists instead of 9 when the game is on the line."
"Not just this sub, but the general notion that Russell Westbrook is a bad teammate/selfish/stat-padder.   I got into an argument in another thread where someone said Russ was ""stat-padding"" his assists by dumping the ball off instead of taking lay-ups after the defense crashes on him. Like what? Finding the open man is bad basketball now? Seriously. The lengths some people go to in order to justify their positions will never cease to amaze me."
"Why would 'making the playoffs' be a line for you though? Russell westbrook has been carrying his team to the playoffs the last few years and he's a lesser lebron.  Winning and dominance matters. Last year lebron had a great argument to still have the #1 spot but this year he does not, and the eye test supports it as well."

"Wow how did i misread this  &gt; [Dawson] Really interesting insight from Dennis Schröder about Billy Donovan. Talked about how much he likes Billy’s willingness to listen to players but says “when he listens to that **bitchass Russell Westbrook** everything goes to shit, every time."""
"Not saying he isn't. Curry is symbolically the leader of your team. A franchise player, just like russell westbrook is for the thunder."
"You really believe Russ is acting like a clown to Tramel because he didn't know some names at media day and he wrote some things about Durant?   Seriously? Have you read any of his articles about Westbrook? (I have and most of them have not been negative in anyway. A few have questioned facets of Westbrook's game that anyone with eyes can question. Overall? Tramel has been fine with Russ and he was a MASSIVE defender of Russ early on in his career. Seriously, go read the columns)   You know how I know that you know nothing of this reporter and Russ? You don't even bring up Russ saying ""I don't like you"" in January of 2015 to the same reporter.   Russ isn't doing this because of a botched media day or a Durant article. If you really want to know the reason and have interest in WHY Russ did what he did, listen to this podcast:  https://hoopshype.com/2019/04/22/nba-russell-westbrook-next-question-media-writer-berry-tramel-press-conference-russ/  This is an hour long podcast with someone interviewing Tramel. Tramel spends some of the podcast defending Westbrook. He also says he knows what happened, starts it off with ""I am not entirely innocent in this"" and pinpoints the EXACT day Russ went off on him this time.   If you don't want to listen, don't. FWIW: I don't know Berry Tramel, but I know a lot about him. I was a journalism major who wanted to be a sports reporter and I went to college in Oklahoma. Tramel is very well respected by his colleagues. (one wrote about him in The Athletic recently)   Lastly, I don't need any reporter to tell me Russ thinks of them about the same as he thinks of pond scum. Just watch a damned interview. He doesn't look at them, answers questions like he's being held at gun point and has been openly hostile on multiple occasions. (Like telling a reporter asking him a question ""I don't like you"" for example) Russ makes his view of all things media crystal clear."
Russell Westbrook has to be the worst player in the history
"Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Dwayne Wade, Dwight Howard, James Harden, Steve Nash, Allen Iverson, Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo (if he keeps up another 5 years of his current output)  Came up with 14 off the top of my head, pretty sure I missed some other big names possibly"
"Russell Westbrook has the second most toxic contract in the NBA atm, of course they would do it for a All-Star potential PG and a lethal shooter."
"If I'm a Clippers brass, not a chance. Russell Westbrook has a supermax contract and he's not living to the expectation. SGA is a tall 6'6"" PG and he can be another Jason Kidd who can improve his teammates."

Russell Wilson to NY LeBron to NY Westbrook to LA George to LA Kawhi getting traded to LA Butler getting traded to LA AD getting traded to LA  It’s almost like the media hypes these signing or trades to big markets that suck ass🧐🧐 or maybe I’m just reading into it too much
this sub worries too much about how others post. it's never going to be perfect  The way Russell acted vs Dame was funny because Westbrook talked all that shit to shoot bricks and lose 4-1 that's why people were shitting on him..  that is possible to do and still recognize that Westbrook is a superstar
Russell Westbrook?
"He's already better in my eyes. Never rated the pre-KD Warriors that highly and when they gutted their bench for KD these past few rings he won made me really appreciate what he did. That bench depth and Steph + Klay (whose highly inconsistent) + Draymond on defense is what made the pre-KD Warriors great.  &amp;#x200B;  The issue was that in OKC he NEVER had shooters. And people subconsciously admit this when they talk about what help Russell Westbrook needs. They constantly complain that he's never had shooters outside of KD and PG. So my question is, since Russ' only shooter was KD, what floor spacer did KD have to allow him to operate freely like LeBron has always had? (Korver, Kyrie, Love, Ray Allen, Mike Miller, Chalmers, Battier, etc.)  &amp;#x200B;  If he goes to NY and they provide him with floor spacers then you'll see the same KD you see here in Golden State, and he was damn good in OKC with that all-time terrible level of floor spacing."
Russell Westbrook.  There is your answer.

So do you have a real basketball argument or are you just gonna keep using FG% for a center who scores in a limited amount of ways and name calling?

"&gt; Klay is definitely an all-star. He is a 3&amp;D guy but an elite one who can guard 1-3 reliably and is one of the best 3 point shooters in the league.  Not sure I agree that it's ""definitely"" when you look at the other players that miss out being all-stars in the West.  Currently the other backcourt players who made it in the West were: Steph Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Damian Lillard.  This notably leaves out: DeMar DeRozan, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Mike Conley, and Jrue Holiday. It also leaves out borderline glue guys like CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, and Lou Williams. Next year Luka Doncic is almost certainly going to be in the mix.  Is Klay arguably better than a bunch of those guys? Absolutely. But I don't think one can say he is ""definitely"" in the top 5 guards in the West.   Conley and Holiday are super underrated. Booker would almost certainly be an all star if he wasn't on a team that only won 4 games a year. It's hard to think Doncic won't soar in voting next year. DeRozan is still really good and is a 4-time all-star already."
"Spiting the media contest? Let me introduce you to my friend, Russell Westbrook."
"all i read was ""Russell Westbrook is upset""."
Cowherd is racist and if Russell Westbrook or John Wall was white he wouldnt have been nearly as hard on them over the years .
Agreed. People forget about that. Russell won 11 championships when Wilt was playing in the NBA. Wilt was the original Russell Westbrook. Athletic freak but not good at decision making or being a team player.
"&gt;How is he insecure?  I have a story for you:   I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there.  Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared.  It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy.""  My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."

"This shits on melo more than it does Russ. Melo's only redeeming quality is his scoring, if Russell Westbrook is doing that at the same clip and rate while doing other stuff then that's a problem."
Objectively Russell Westbrook is more talented than Damian Lillard
Imagine if Russell Westbrook was LeBron James.
"slightly mis-titled in that he even concedes that westbrook's teammates do help him get the easy rebounds, and that westbrook does care a ton about his stats. but that's actually a minor point and i think the video does a great job of explaining westbrook's value to his team. fits more to me as ""russell westbrook is a stat-padder, but that's okay"".  the one part that didn't convince me was the defense. i get that russ is good at deflections but i'm convinced that they'd be a better defensive team if he played tougher defense on his man. it's just more value than being a ball-hawk, no matter how good a ball-hawk you may be, because there'll always be an open man.  i'd be curious to see if there was any difference in the offense for cases where westbrook himself gets the rebound versus cases where his teammate gets it and gives him the outlet pass immediately. i doubt there's any difference at all, and if not, i'd be telling westbrook to stay on his man. he can chase the loose ball or deflection or get a rebound immediately after that, and if his teammate gets it, he can still run the break. if there really is a difference in the offense between westbrook getting the rebound vs having it passed to him immediately, then fine, but if not, i don't buy westbrook's defensive strategy at all."
The fact that we’re built on athleticism and not shooting when our superstar is Russell Westbrook is precisely the reason we haven’t gotten out of the first round in three years
"Book it. Next season will be the the Russell Westbrook redemption arc. I know everyone says that this happens ever year, but this is the last time it happens. This one stings. And, if Russ never wins again, this Portland series will be what defines his legacy. Russ is about to go on a tear. His stubbornness is what makes him so great (and also very frustrating), but I think he finally understands what it takes, and it will all click this summer... Playoff Russ will be a problem."

"Having Dame in their over Westbrook,Lowry and Simmons feels wrong. Jrue Holiday also made some great strides as a passer this season and I can put him over Lollards comfortably. Trae Young is only a rookie and is already a phenomenal passer. Fox made a big jump in his playmaking as well. Draymond is still a great passer especially for his position.  I’d say the top 5 locked in no order are LeBron, CP3, Harden, Russ, Jokic.  Following that I’d put Lowry and Simmons closely behind the bottom of the top 5.  And to round out the top 10 I’d probably put Lillard, Fox, Young, Irving, and Russell in no order.  So best case scenario Lillard is 8."
"I know what you mean though. Like for a more exaggerated example, (not to add to shit on Russ week), but if you compare Russell Westbrook with a guy like Jrue Holiday, or Bradley Beal. Westbrook is definitely and deservingly the better player, but I think if you polled teams on who’d they prefer to add to their team, I’m not sure Russ wins it. I still think Westbrook is better than those players, but it’s an interesting discussion I think."

Russell Westbrook has never been a top 5 NBA player either
"i mean i just looked up ""Russell Westbrook gets mad at reporter"" and [this came up] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUjn6XR8lBI) where he literally blows up over the wording of a question from Barry that wasn't even directed at him. i literally cannot see any other superstar getting that pissed over a question that's not even directed at them"
"Russell Westbrook is the best hustler in the entire NBA, IMO.  This dude is ALWAYS active on the court, and you never see him take a lazy play."
"&gt;but it is so odd to me  is it really that odd to you? like you might disagree with the reaction, but is it really that odd to you that somebody as respected and successful as Pop could be getting less shit from the media than Russell Westbrook?"
"My rankings right now. I believe players like Lebron and AD (possibly Giannis, Kahwi, Westbrook, etc.) will probably go up next season after proving themselves again  Tier 1:  1. Kevin Durant  2.

"Also Warriors wouldn’t be playing ISO heavy with KD like they were which would change everything. KD couldn’t beat the Warriors with Russell Westbrook, so I don’t think he can with the clippers."
but where in the world is Russell Westbrook?
What numbers have provided? Ahahaha pretending you aren’t mad  when you are is awkward lmfao  Sorry Damian Lillard playing better than Russell Westbrook doesn’t make him better than Kyrie. He just got swept lol
Russell Westbrook?
But Russell Westbrook and Terrance Ferguson weren't playing tonight
but this year he picked up a son in russell westbrook.
Lilliard just needs to imagine all the Warriors as Russell Westbrook and he can win it for the Blazers.
Russell Westbrook would shoot California out of the game
"Bill Russell: ""The way I play my team wins"".   Had Wilt understood that teams he lead would have won more titles. Individual stats don't mean anything if you keep losing. See Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook is a top 3 pg
"It really is. Utah in general is awesome if you’re into that stuff, or saying offensive shit to Russell Westbrook."
"I’m glad you can prove me otherwise. He’s at the very least in the bottom half of defensive guards. Bledsoe, Lowry, Simmons, Beverly, Westbrook, Lonzo, Rubio, White, CP3, Conley, Holiday, Rondo, Hill, Russell, and probably a few others are almost certainly much better defenders than Curry.   Many other players are arguable.   Compared to every other PG in the league? Sure, he’s average for his position, but he’s a bad starting defender and absolutely below average overall.   Every time he has an amazing stretch of games or a series this bullshit argument that he’s suddenly a decent defender comes out of the woodworks. It’s literally not true, many times they’ve schemed to get curry off of the good offensive players.   I mean Jesus just look how many times the rockets tried to switch onto curry lmao"
"Yes, the chucker known as Russell Westbrook."
One was playing with Mo Williams as his second best player and the other had Russell Westbrook.
"I never thought the ""Curry isn't a great rebounding guard"" was a jab.  He mentioned Jason Kidd and Russell Westbrook as great rebounding guards.  He's right.  Curry is not as good at rebounding as those guys.  It's not a jab, because there is a distinction.  I like Curry, but not enough to be offended when people don't call him a great rebounder."
"The NBA lockout was only 8 years ago, but the only players on each teams starting 5 to stay until now are:  Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Dirk Nowitski, and John Wall"
"He WAS the best, but was never considred clear cut. I don't see anything wrong with that.  Deron Williams, Derrick Rose, Tony Parker, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry were all being debated as being better."
That’s like once a month or once every ten games. “On any given night” is like Russell Westbrook and triple doubles.
Y’all niggas trippin-Russell Westbrook
Hope Russell Westbrook can see this and decide to change.
"I'll say it right now, one of those 2 star role players (Draymond Green) is a more valuable playoff contributor than Russell Westbrook."

Not following you literally every time I click on a thread I see you saying dumb shit about dame.  No matter how much you whine and bitch he still owns russell westbrook. Nothing will change that.
You underestimate how hard it is to win meaningful playoff games with Russell Westbrook dominating the ball.
"Most of the answer would be the stat-padding side of Russell Westbrook. But damn when he plays to win, its a thing of beauty. Only thing he needs to fix is his shot selections."
"A lot of people say Lillard ?? Report just came out he playing with broken rib bones!!  All of you couldn’t even get off a couch let alone play a basketball game with that sorta pain!!  So quick to hate!!! My say would be NO ONE !!!!! Are you in the NBA??? Even the most benched player in the NBA could wipe up the floor with you.. Russell Westbrook ?? Could u take him one on one ?? Kyle Lowry ?? Let’s see you get knocked down every game and still get up !  Some of you hate and hate and criticize all these players,  but what have any of you done besides watch a game? And say oh I would have !! You would have  done what ? Sat on your couch and ate more chips ??  Not one player is overrated !, they worked hard to get there regardless if they have disappointed you. You didn’t do any better so why even comment? We expect these guys to be perfect but it’s impossible,  embrace the sport instead of just being a critic.  Otherwise shut the fuck up and get on the court and show the world you can be a champion too !! L"
"Russell Westbrook  Sure the guy averaged a triple double for 3 straight years, but what has he done without KD. The guy can’t lead a team, plain and simple. They could’ve gone to at least the WCF this year, but nope Dame sent them home in FIVE"
"My argument is that a certain number of baskets happen during every basketball game regardless   The value of a player is in creating points where other players wouldn’t   Stockton’s 7 consecutive 12+ assistseasons lead to these overall offenses: 16th, 17th, 10th, 11th, 4th, 7th, 7th  The best stretch of Curry, Nash, or Magic would go more like: 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1...etc.  Sloan’s system funneled assist opportunities through stockton in a way that maxed out in his statistical prime as *one* top 5 offense. Much like a volume scorer who only played on average offenses, I don’t think this is as impressive as it looks  Elite PG play is measured by making your teammates better, not assist stats. Russell Westbrook can lead the league in assists, but he’s not improving guys like Steph Curry  Which is not to say Stockton was great, but his tremendous assist numbers, imo, don’t make him a better passer than Magic or Nash"
I mean clutch shot from a likeable player against a DPOY caliber player from 35-40ft buzzer beater to win the series and eliminate Russell Westbrook.   That’s just begging for number 1

You can watch him destroy russell westbrook again if you want.  Explain to me how he isnt even on the same tier as westbrook when he embarrassed him

"Draymond Green is the Russell Westbrook of the Warriors. When he gets to lead the fast break after a miss, good things happen."
Draymond has more playoff triple doubles than Russell Westbrook.  He has more triple doubles than anyone in playoff history.  But r/nba tells me he is a product of playing on the Golden State Warriors.
He always was. Russell Westbrook has done dog shit in the playoffs despite significantly better teams.  How the fuck do you lose to this Portland team missing Nurkic when you have Paul George on your team?
Russell Westbrook is not a good defender.
Give Leonard the Russell Westbrook treatment. Back it up let him try
Does my original team have Russell Westbrook on it
"Good question. Too many people didn’t understand that your question relates only to performance. Here are some answers:  1. KD was given more leeway because almost everyone was scapegoating Russell Westbrook for the Thunder’s struggles.  2. Steph was already being somewhat shat on for not being the best player in their previous championship, in which Iguodala won Finals MVP.  3. Curry’s Warriors were “supposed to win” because of the 73-9 record and his MVP season, whereas Durant’s Thunder team was the underdog going against the best team in history (up to that point).  To summarize, the narrative seemed to be that Durant wasn’t given the proper chance to shine (bc of coaching and Westbrook) whereas Curry had the full advantage and spotlight. Not saying I agree, btw."

"It's always so funny to hear Charles expressed these truths and honesties about how bad the league has become given he's probably the most well known analyst because he's absolutely right.  He said here how bad it is that players just want to team up together. Yup, that's basically what the future of this league is with all these guys knowing each other since middle school playing their shitty AAU camps and how kids today have the whole ""I want to always win everything!"" mindset. Players like Russell Westbrook are going to be gone in the next decade. And Charles mentions the word ""contraction"" in this interview which I never thought I would hear an analyst discuss. Yeah, the league basically only wants the biggest market teams to succeed and I'm pretty sure the fans do too. The league really needs contraction to just get down to mainly the big markets and some larger/more successful small markets for both media coverage and centralizing talent, but instead the NBA wants to expand so it's going to get even worse.  And unfortunately no matter how bad the league is, or how bad it gets, it's just going to keep growing because for some reason that I can't grasp, NBA fans don't seem to care about the product on the court. I don't really understand what NBA fans actually care about."
"A lot of small markets have had it ALOT better than the Knicks and have pissed away talent. The Thunder have had Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Oladipo, Serge Ibaka, Carmelo Anthony, Paul George on their squad and nothing to show for it. Durant, Westbrook, and Harden they didnt even ""earn"" if we're talking about tanking not being acceptable, they just got lucky. Matter of fact did you know the Knicks have the 3rd worst lottery luck in the NBA moving down so many times? What free agents have we brought in over the years? Amare and who? We traded for Carmelo. And got screwed over because Amare got injured. You ""small markets"" dont know how good you have had it. Time for the Knicks to get some luck and us fans to see some competent basketball."
"Curry, Lillard, Irving, Walker, Conley, Westbrook, Paul, Holiday, Bledsoe, Lowry, Simmons, and Fox I think are all just strictly better.  Then you get into a broad tier of injured guys (Dragic, Wall, Teague), guys who are roughly equivalent in different situations (Murray), and guys who are better by advanced stats but don't pass the eye test (Jackson, Collison).  So if you put Russell in the middle of that group, as a rough heuristic, you're looking at about 15th-16th, which is my point. Or put differently: he's not a max player if he's not in the top 5 (maybe 10) at his position."
"I agree, that looked pretty good.  Now I want to see a video of someone absolutely blazing through this drill.  A young Russell Westbrook maybe."
I didnt know russell westbrook couldnt swim
Yeah but Paul George was able to lead a team with Russell Westbrook to the 6th seed...

Russell Westbrook is friends with Kevin Love
"That time Russell Westbrook was about to clinch his triple double season average in Phoenix, but the Suns would foul anyone he passed to so that he didn't get the final assist he needed."
"Have you ever heard of a dude named Russell Westbrook? CP3 is pretty intense on the court but he seems to be a lot more chill once the games over. I’m convinced Russell Westbrook pays someone to piss in his Cheerios every morning, that dude is just on edge and pissed all the time."
Fam its Russell Westbrook get your fucking memes together
3rd best PG in the league**  Russell Westbrook is better than Damian Lillard.
Russell Westbrook
They're both physical specimens but Zion is tiers higher in some other universe. It's like saying DeAaron Fox and Russell Westbrook are both fast except Fox is bigger..yes true but Westbrook is just a different level

The biggest takeaway from this is that VORP loves Russell Westbrook
"Yet they beat the Thunder who have Russell Westbrook (former MVP) and Paul George (MVP consideration until mid-way of the season) and the Denver Nuggets (2nd seed in the West, Jokic who is playing at MVP-level)... again how is this team a ""worst team"" with these wins...?  What do y'all mean by ""worst team""...?"
"I see what you did there. You changed your original comment.  So instead of "" She has never asked a player a difficult question.""  You go with "" She didn't make a player a difficult question.""  Right.    FYI: No reporter can *make* a player answer a question.  Just ask [Berry Trammel](https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/russell-westbrook-berry-tramel-next-question-2019-playoffs.html). He only gets 'Next question' out of Westbrook.   Your claim *was* that she didn't ask difficult questions, suggesting she isn't doing her due diligence or isn't asking the question that matter or that fans/viewers what to know the answers to. That's not true: she is.   She just knows enough not to be difficult when the player clearly has no interest in answering a question and has enough emotional intelligence to see where pushing an issue is only going to sabotage the rest of the interview.  Even in her recent Curry interview she didn't just ask the ""When KD's gone"" question once, she reworded it in different ways and offered different phrasing and context before moving on.   So I'm not sure what your point is, but not conceding the point and then changing your argument isn't accomplishing anything."
"2016 WCF, Russell Westbrook shoots the 3 ball better than KD. Kd shoots less than 3% better from the field than Westbrook. KD taking 24 shots a game an WB taking about 22 a game. Is that Westbrook's fault?   Quit making excuses."
You're literally delusional if you think a Russell Westbrook/Roberson back court of all time. Have a good day   There's an argument to be made that WB outplayed KD in the 2016 WCF
I think Giannis should be MVP but you can definitely be outside top 5 in league and win it i.e Russell Westbrook
"&gt;I think he just didn't want to end up like some of the veterans of the past, like ~~Karl Malone~~ Russell Westbrook, who never make it to a ring and than, at the end of their careers, try a desperate attempt to put together a super team."
"That's not the point. Him being more efficient than Westbrook should be a given. Kevin Durant doesn't get bonus points for being more efficient than Russell Westbrook. The fact that he was shooting sub 40% from the field and sub 30% from 3 is damning. Her performed well below standard, when he should've been playing ABOVE standard."

"The way he moves, he makes Javale McGee look like Russell Westbrook."
"He's not anywhere remotely close to being compared to Lebron. Russell Westbrook, another small market superstar has 13M insta followers. Giannis has 4M. Lebron has 49M.  He's not anywhere in the same stratosphere as not just Lebron but some of the other major stars of the game in terms of casual fan appeal. It's just not happening for him as much as they're trying."
"Sure. Here's an example of a team revoking press credentials of reporters.   [https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/11/mavericks-mark-cuban-espn](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/11/mavericks-mark-cuban-espn)   Here's an article from 2015 talking about Westbrook and Durant's antagonism towards the press and how the Thunder have shielded them. It also goes into some detail about Westbrook's petty feud with Barry Tramel. I assume that they haven't completely banned him because he hasn't actually done anything wrong, but my impression is that the team gives him only the bare minimum and treat him as poorly as they feel like they can get away with treating him.

"&gt; Russell Westbrook hasn't been held in breach of contract either.  Then the fines wouldn't be valid. You can't decide to fine somebody unless they've violated a condition of their contract. I don't really have any problem with criticizing Westbrook for his approach, I just don't think your comparison really works and actually demonstrates how athletes are held to a higher standard. As long as it fits within their persona, Tarantino isn't gonna have to worry about getting suspended from his next movie because of a bad interview. They'll get noise, but afaik, celebrity contracts are nowhere close to as restrictive and Draconian as athlete contracts. They have similar morality clauses and such but either they're pretty much never enforced or they aren't as strictly defined."
I always wondered how Westbrook would fare with Pop.  Probably not well (and I don’t much care for Russell) but the idea fascinates me.
"I think almost anyone would take Russ over Blake though.  And where you see ""Westbrook lite"" I could just as easily see ""Westbrook with a higher bball IQ.""   And where you see ""Blake with elite defense"" I could just as easily see a ""shorter version of Blake.""  Of course we'll never know with either guy for a few years but just off this discussion, if we agree on Russ/Blake comparisons I'd rather have a Russell Westbrook than a Blake Griffin of any sort. But hey, that's just my opinion.   It'd be hard to pass on Zion though, fans would vandalize my property lol."
"I don't know that it's actually happened with a big star. Wouldn't likely be worth it for a studio unless the actor decided to do press altogether. All I'm saying is that they're contractually obligated to promote the film and represent it well and could, in theory, be sued if they didn't do so.  Russell Westbrook hasn't been held in breach of contract either. Look, I'm sympathetic to players in these situations. I defended Cam Newton when he left his post-Super Bowl press conference early because he was sitting like three feet away from a gloating Broncos player. But when he made sexist comments towards a local beat reporter in another instance, that was not okay and he was rightfully forced to apologize. Similarly, I don't mind Westbrook displaying human emotion and being genuinely upset after a tough loss, but he has a terrible attitude towards reporters on a regular basis and has a personal vendetta against a local beat guy for no real reason."
"No. They don't. An A-list star may get to choose whether they go on Kimmel or Fallon, but they're not lining up their own press junkets. That's up to the studios and it's absolutely contractually obligated, not something they're just doing out of the goodness of their hearts. Actors have walked out of interviews before, but it's a big news story when it happens because it's so uncommon and it's not exactly praised. They won't be fined, but they could absolutely be held in breach of contract.  Please tell me what exactly was said to Russell Westbrook that was ""out of bounds."""

I would like to be watching Paul George, Russell Westbrook. I would have liked to see Derrick Rose to full potential. And others I might never even heard of.   I was just watching a video about top drafts in the past years and a lot of them were 'busts' because of injuries.   I would hate seeing for example Giannis Injured, Kawhi, Zion just got injured."
"No. If you are a good enough player and lead your team to success the off the court shit will come. Giannis is developing into a huge star despite being in one of the smallest markets. LeBron became a mega star in Cleveland. PG built fame in Indiana and then OKC. Russell Westbrook And KD got big in OKC. Shit even 10 years ago people would not have considered GSW a premier market team at all and Steph is arguably the most popular player in the league.  It is 2019, not everything revolves around NYC or LA anymore. And I live in NYC so it isn’t just small town bias or something."

Russell Westbrook and Patrick Beverley
"Well the parity that the league is trying to maintain is between very good teams (think Warriors or Rockets) and very bad teams (Chicago or Atlanta), not bad teams and very bad teams as in your example. It’s not as if any playoff team was able to get a top 14 pick in the draft unless a team willingly gave them that pick.  The draft system recently changed only because teams (Philly) were abusing the way it was and tanking on purpose, in order to leverage that into a very high likelihood of getting the first pick. The change is actually good because bad teams still have a chance at the first overall pick, and are deincentivized from tanking because the guarantee of the number 1 pick is less than it used to be.   Lastly, recall that just because you have the number one pick, does not mean you will end up getting the best player in the draft. Giannis and Kawhi Leonard were both double digit picks in the draft and are the best remaining players in their conference. One year two teams passed over Joel Embiid who was the best player in his draft and selected Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker, both of whom are undoubtedly much worse than Embiid.  Having a high pick is not meant to guarantee a great player, it is meant to guarantee that fewer teams will pick the player you want to draft before you can. It is still up to the franchise to do its due diligence and scout well.  Lastly, I assume that as a Knicks fan, you’re unhappy with the third pick, but personally I think Zion will bust and that in a few years the wear and tear of being a nearly 300 pound NBA player who jumps and lands from abnormally high heights even for a basketball player, will take a toll on his knees and affect his career. He’s basically Shaquille O’Neal’s weight as a rookie in the body of Russell Westbrook. I still believe that RJ Barrett is the best player in the draft and that in five years, everyone will agree with that"
"33.8% from 3 in college on his volume means nothing, plenty of guys shoot it well in college and then struggle when they get to the NBA. Russell Westbrook shot 33.8% on slightly higher volume his sophomore year before the NBA and he's a historically bad 3pt shooter. Chris Paul - 47% (!) in his two college seasons, 28.2% as an NBA rookie. Draymond Green - 36.6% and 38.8% in his last two years of college, 32.3% NBA career with one season above 33.7%. Adreian Payne - 40.9% in college, 25.4% in the NBA. Especially for big men, the slightly shorter line makes a world of difference. The further out you are, the less leeway you have with an imperfect shot.  You determine how a shooter projects based on the difficulty, distance, and volume of their 3pt attempts in college, in addition to FT% which has proven to translate really well. Guys like Curry, Hield, Redick, etc definitely looked like they'd be great shooters. Zion not so much."
"We wouldn't have faced the Lakers if Tmac wasn't injured, he was today's Russell Westbrook"
How do I @ Russell Westbrook on this.
Russell Westbrook dislikes.
Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook...because you know why and Serge Ibaka and Robin Lopez cuz also you know why
"Then go to Boston, San Antonio, or the Clippers. Any team that wasn’t winning championships when they wanted him.    And OKC didn’t provide anything? He didn’t play next to James Harden and Russell Westbrook? Oladipo and Horford weren’t coming if he stayed? That’s a terrible take.   He picked a team that won a ring already so he could just overpower the league and get rings. That’s it."
Honorable mentions to Russell Westbrook and Dame Lillard
Paul George and Russell westbrook live in LA. Tom Brady lives in LA. Who cares where they live.
No title contender would or should want Russell Westbrook. His shot selection and decision making is horrific in late situations.
Paul George and Russell Westbrook won’t be traded. Donovan would be fired and the rest of the roster would be put up for sale

he has to spend over 8 months a year in Oklahoma and gets to play with a declining chucker in Russell Westbrook.   that's a fate worse than death

"A lot of people here are projecting their own narcissism.  What if KD just wanted to play basketball at the highest level on a team where the ball actually moves.  I can’t imagine anything worse than playing with a point guard like Russell Westbrook. Or playing for a franchise who let James Harden go right after making the Finals over 4 million dollars.  How can anyone turn down Jerry West? Who is going to say no to playing for Steve Kerr who played with MJ and Duncan, and was coached by Phil and Coach Pop. Imagine the stories Kerr has about his playing days.  The reason the W’s are successful is they emphasize unselfish ego-less basketball. NO ONE is bigger than team."

"Not defending the guy, but there were some fake tweets/instagram comments falsely attributed to him that circulated, too. Someone did some PI work. I'm pretty sure the most widely circulated one of him using the n-word is fake.  [But even the non-doctored ones were really bad.](https://blacksportsonline.com/2019/03/the-jazz-fan-shane-keisel-who-reportedly-told-russell-westbrook-to-get-down-on-his-knees-like-hes-use-to-is-maga-a-big-trump-supporter-video/8/)"
" I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the  lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."

"Markannen is the only 7""0 player to average 18 ppg  and 2 3P/G in a single season (I'm still kind of amazed Dirk never did it, although if he averaged the same amount of attempts that Lauri had this past season he definitely would have done it more than a few times). Also to cherrypick some more, Lauri is one of 4 players to average 18, 9 RPG, and 2 3P/G. The other 3? Kevin Love (2X), Russell Westbrook, and DeMarcus Cousins."
"I mean... All due respect to Lowry, but PG is a VERY deep position in the league right now:  PGs who I think basically everyone would agree are better than Lowry: Steph curry, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, kemba, Chris Paul, Westbrook   PGs who I think you could make a case for as ahead of Lowry: Ben Simmons, DeAngelo Russell, John wall (depending on if/when he ever returns), Conley, doncic.  So we have like 6ish dudes that are definitely ahead of Lowry and another 5ish that could go either way. So it's not THAT crazy to suggest Lowry might fall outside the top 10 pgs.  Again, not hating here at all; actually an a big Lowry fan. Just illustrating how deep the position is."
You think James Harden and Russell Westbrook were HOFers in 2012?
"I googled it and saw a slightly different order but same posts. Must have to be some algorithm thing.

I liked this result a lot https://www.nba.com/clippers/news/chris-paul-named-sports-humanitarian-year    Just gotta address your #3 result as well  &gt; And the #3 result is an article titled ""Everybody Hates Chris (Paul)""...on ClipsNation.com...from 2015  Did you bother to actually click and read that article? It's pro-CP3 and making the argument of him being an all-NBA player that year (though the author does agree that he should still be behind Curry and Harden)  Another interesting quote from the article, ""But rather than getting the same hatred flung at them like Paul endures, guys like Russell Westbrook and Steph Curry are able to flop and do the same things without any ramifications from the outside world. Reputation is an interesting thing, to say the least."""

"Again - you're trying to bridge the two and equate them, but beyond each being a superstar leaving his original team in free agency, the two are not very similar at all.  Sports are very much about narrative. Lebron having no help. Lebron vs the Big Three. Lebron wanting to win a ring. LBJ's decision to leave definitely shook up how the NBA viewed superstars and their agency in picking their supporting cast, but if you refer back to the three narratives, Lebron was still against his adversaries. He was recruiting allies in his quest to beat the eternal enemy (dramatic for dramatic's sake).  Was he wrong to leave his teammates and give up on winning with that roster? I could definitely see an argument for it. I mean, my goodness, he got to the Finals with stalwarts like *Drew Gooden* and *Zydrunas Ilgauskas* defending the Cavalier paint whilst **clear** HOF shooters like *Daniel Gibson* and *Donyell Marshall* anchored his wings.  Honestly, the more I see it, Kevin Durant was the **real** victim here. Dude got to the Finals in 2012 carrying scrubs like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Derek Fisher, and Kendrick Perkins. With that cast? No way he could win against Lebron, absolutely zero chance of winning with those cats. Don't even get me started with 2016, he may have had the GOAT Kyle Singler on his team, but the rest of that cast? Russell ""Noah's dad"" Westbrook, Steven ""ball'less"" Adams, Enes Kanter, Andre Roberson, Serge ""just a chef"" *fuckin'* Ibaka - talk about *LUDICROUS* to imagine Kevin Durant winning anything with that team. They probably struggled to break .500 and were bounced early by the Spurs or something...  Oh wait, they crushed Dallas in Round 1, defeated the 67-15 Spurs in 6, and were 3-1 up against the Warriors before losing 3 straight, with KD going 12-31, 10-31, and an admittedly respectable 10-19 in Games 5, 6, and 7 respectively (Russ did have a stinker going 7-21 in Game 7).   I'm going to take off the mask and say definitively - no, KD's situation was not like Lebron's. KD's situation cannot be classified as no help. KD's situation cannot be classified as repeatedly failing against a bigger, better, and stronger team - OKC had faced the Warriors **once**, and had a 3-1 series lead. KD bailed at the first sign of adversity, which explains his insecurity. There could be a serious argument for OKC having enough pieces to win the chip (and good management to bring better pieces if need be), KD's decision was very soft and nobody can or should respect it.   The closest situation to Kevin Durant's case is Lebron James' decision, but that does not mean they are indeed close, just that Kevin Durant's is so absolutely outlandish that nothing else comes close. I'm not a Thunder fan and I thoroughly enjoy roasting Russell Westbrook's selfish play, and I still get extremely riled up thinking of Kevin Durant's move. It was a straight up bitch-ass move and he deserves every bit of calling out for it."

"&gt;If MJ was in the league today, he'd basically just be a slightly better version of Russell Westbrook and he'd likely have 0 rings  I won't call you names because that's how I got banned last time, but I'm just saying this is name-call worthy"

"I love the false comparisons. KoBe aNd LeBroN DiD tHe sAMe ThInG!!   Kobe literally had Smush Parker, and Kwame Brown starting and wanted to join who? Kirk Hinrich and Ben Gordon? Also didn't join Steve Nash/Amare/Matrix      LeBron had Mo Williams and Drew Gooden. He joined Wade and Bosh, but those those guys wouldn't win 73 games without Bron in the WESTERN Conference. Also didn't join Garnett/Allen/Rondo/Pierce or Duncan/Parker/Ginobili   KD left Russell Westbrook, the chance to play with Oladipo and Al Horford for a team that won 73 games and he had down 1-3 in the WCF (where the older version of this team just swept the WCF Finals lmao). No one cares that he left OKC, it's who he left them for. **KD's supporting cast is a 73-9 team.**  He's free to do it, but he's not free from criticism and the fact he ruined the competitive balance of the league in the softest move in American Sports."
"Tremendous young talent?  Do they really?  Lonzo hasn't progressed from his rookie season, Ingram might have a serious medical condition, and people love to over value Kuzma and Hart.  Tremendous young talent is a team that had russell westbrook, harden, ibaka and durant all on rookie deals and they couldn't make it work or win...and they had competent people at the front of the organization.  Just because they were drafted by the lakers doesn't make them tremendous."
Russell Westbrook
Yup. And I dare someone to look me in the eye and say Russell Westbrook roid rage looking ass is not on something.
"Context is important. I don't think OP is talking about players like that.  I think he is referring to players who are in conversations of top 100 players.  For example, if you took off one of LeBron's rings and added an MVP, would that enhance or decrease his legacy? To me, it would decrease it, implying that in conversations about who the greatest player ever is, championships are more important.  The way I see it, a championship is a reflection to do the ultimate thing: win.  MVP is a reflection of having the most talent. But since it's a regular season award, you play both good and bad teams, and there are plenty of opportunities to pad those stats and solidify an MVP campaign.  However, in the playoffs, the competition is far stiffer, and people who win championships consistently, to me, are more impressive than people who put up good regular season numbers.  Another example: Kawhi has 0 MVPs. Russell Westbrook has 1. Kawhi has a championship. RW doesn't. Who in your eyes is the better player?  So yeah, I'd argue that in conversations regarding top players, championship rings is by far the most important indicator. When talking about lesser players, well since lesser players never win MVP anyway, it's clear you just look at their stats and compare and championships are a secondary factor."

Rodman) weren’t even great until they left Chicago 8) The Thunder were favorites to win the finals against the Heat(not an opinion, just a reminder) 9) Shake Milton is the next Reggie Miller 10) The Pelicans WILL win a chip in the next 30 years"

"It's not really about elevating those individual player's game although that is the case in some cases. It's about suddenly making a role player an integral part of a contender. Curry does the same thing he makes his teammates better. So did Shaq and Duncan. Role players playing with them suddenly become very important.  That was the case at the time though. In their preseason interview, all three of them Bosh, Wade, and James said Boston was the team to beat. Boston literally had a big 3 and beat both James and Wade the previous years.   Wade was a top 5 player for sure, but Bosh was not and never was. You realize Bosh made 1 all-nba teams his whole career right? He was 2nd team all-nba in 2007. In 2010 his last year with the Raptors he didn't even make the playoffs, and the following big men were on the all-nba teams over Bosh: Bogut, Gasol, Duncan, Nowitzki, Amare, and Howard.  There is no measure that places Bosh has a top 2 or 3 or even top 5 *power forward*.  &gt;Okc has a big 2. Harden wasn’t that guy yet. We was a strong 6-man.  Harden was the 6th man of the year. Ibaka was 1st team all-defense. Kevin Durant was the leading scorer in the league and Russell Westbrook was 5th. OKC was definitely on par with James/Wade/Bosh.  You're also missing teams like the New York Knicks. Carmelo Anthony was all-nba 3rd team same as Wade in 2012. Tyson Chandler was all-nba, all-defense, and the DPOY.  In 2011 there was the 60 win Bulls. Rose was the MVP and Noah was all-defense. They got Jimmy Butler too.  See the Heat had plenty of competitors just as good of them. Remember Chris Bosh was none of these things not all-nba, MVP, DPOY, or all-defense. It was really Wade and James. Technically, some of the teams they faced had more players with accomplishments than them.  This is not the case at all with the Warriors. The Warriors have DPOYs (Draymond), all-defense (Draymond and Klay), multiple all-nba guys (Curry and Durant) and all-stars (Klay). No team they faced comes close to them they don't have equals out there to compete with them.  &gt;Lebron kicks if someone help defends his drive. If not, he tries to finish himself.  He primarily does pick and rolls with rolling bigs like Tristan Thompson, Joel Anthony, Timofey Mozgov etc. These guys were never asked to shoot 3s or even jumpshots. He definitely does not try to finish himself he is 50/50 correct playmaker type of player. His picks and rolls can result in shots for himself in the paint, shots for the big man rolling with him/alley oops, shots for shooters at the 3 point line, or a  3 point shot for James himself. He forces defenses to make mistakes so someone on his team can get a quality shot and he always makes the right play.  &gt;More than just having those guys on Lebrons team, they also were no longer on other teams in the east, making it even weaker.   That's really only the case with Wade. Love was busy not making the playoffs in the West, and Kyrie and Bosh were busy not making the playoffs in the East.   &gt;Likely, those players would have kept their superstar numbers and status though.  How? They would get faded into irrelevance. Karl Anthony Towns gets buried now for doing what Kevin Love was doing on those Wolves. Devin Booker is putting up the same numbers as Kyrie, but Booker isn't recognized as a superstar. In fact, Kyrie really became recognized as a superstar only after his performance in the 2016 finals."

Would have loved to see Russell Westbrook go in on that dude who made that dick suckin joke at him.
"They're all basic ass undergrads who are post-modernists and taught to hate historical greatness at every turn. Of course they despise the Rockets. They don't see greatness or achievement as something to aspire to, they see it as a direct threat to their mediocrity. And thus, remain mediocre.   Funny how an all-time great like Russell Westbrook recognizes exactly what Rockets basketball stands for and knew it was the perfect environment to excel in for the final chapter of his career. Once viewed as the everyman struggling against the oppressive titans of basketball privilege, their ubermench has betrayed their entire life philosophy and left them in shambles. None of this is written in jest or irony, it's a mindset that permeates most corners of reddit where the dissatisfied unite to pull every lobster down into their empty, miserable bucket."

"To me, Scottie Pippen was just a good role player for the Blazers. Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Karl Malone, were just old guys that could barely move and jump, yet people spoke fondly of.     The stars that I grew up watching will be just ordinary players for the next generation of fans. It's a sad reminder that everything changes.      To some younger fan: Dwight is just a role player for the Lakers. Nowitzki, Kobe, Wade are just old guys that can barely move and jump, yet people spoke fondly of.      Some fans will only know Russ as a Rocket. Maybe he doesn't even stay in Houston that long. They'll never enjoy the triple-double, live by the BestBrook die by the WorstBrook, entertainment machine that is Russell Westbrook. We may never see triple-double Westbrook for a whole season again.

"What does this mean? Russell Westbrook, Melo, and all cursed ballhogs have big game numbers. And LeBron, who is always chasing stacked teams, is also the guy his blind fans say doesn't get any help. Maybe it's time to say LeBron doesn't have 8 rings because he doesn't make dudes better"
Off topic but it makes me so mad that we had Russell fucking Westbrook as our starting point guard and for some reason we were at the bottom of pace last season and the year before. Thanks billy
Russell Westbrook type beat
"That's like saying Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Russell Westbrook, Vince Carter, Allen Iverson, John Stockton, Steve Nash etc. dont matter because they didn't win. Not everybody can win. Most great players WON'T win. It takes the right players/coaches at the right time to win. Not just one guy."
Russell Westbrook is the third best player in the league and Kawhi is not in the top five
"So, what, does Kemba Walker get a statue now, too? DeRozan?   When guys like KG, Barkley, and Nash don't have statues it's really fucking hard to argue that Russell Westbrook deserves one."
"But then why are they in the top 5 for transition points per game?  Maybe westbrook gives them more opportunities.    Also, ""the average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possession.  when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto..  After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years.""  -An uproxx article titled Russell Westbrook’s Aggressive Rebounding Isn’t Just About Triple-Doubles, It Fuels OKC’s Offense from Feb 12, 19"
"1. If you gave them all an equal $20M/yr contract, I’d take CP3 in a fantasy draft for my team, before I took 50% of the guys drafted in the First Round of the draft, within the last 3 years..   Before you downvote, I think there should be a “Best Player in the NBA” award **AND** an MVP award..but because there isn’t...  I can slightly waiver on this opinion::: Russell Westbrook should’ve won MVP each of the last 3 seasons.. The Bucks without Giannis make it further than the Thunder without Westbrook (yes even with PG13)"
The Russell Westbrook scheme
"Who would get the rebound?  James Harden with nine rebounds or Russell Westbrook with nine rebounds? Both five feet away from the ball, who grabs it first? 🤔"
They’ll remove the clippers logo to reveal a Los Angeles Thunder logo. Russell Westbrook and Ashton Kutcher appear from under the desk and say that they punk’d all thunder fans   ^^pls
Russell Westbrook is pretty ugly too so they nailed that one

"It's not like they're going to be awful. But did they get better?  I think the 2018 Rockets team is on the short list of best teams never to win a title.   However, here's the cause for counterargument:  Part of the reason why the Rockets have been fantastic is that Chris Paul has been fantastic. He's arguably the greatest &lt;6'2 player of all time and the second-greatest PG since Magic.   He's so good, in fact, that even in a year when it was obvious that declining athleticism was reducing his value, RPM rated him as the twelfth best player in the league.   Westbrook was not the twelfth best player in the league (RPM had him ranked 42nd). Even though he's younger, his game appears to be suffering a similar athleticism-related decline. Unlike CP3, his game relies heavily on this athleticism and his areas of weakness (shooting, court vision) are exactly those areas he'll need to maintain elite production as his athleticism continues to slide.  (I recognize that it's weird to talk about Russ as having declining athleticism since he's still more athletic than 3/4 of the league. But he used to be the most athletic guy in the league, and if you compare Russ today with Russ of 5-6 years ago, the decline is obvious. Go watch video of, I dunno, the Warriors-Thunder series in 2016. It's striking.).   So from an objective, talent standpoint they got worse. Even if Russ improves going into next year because of an improved situation, he's probably not going to be as good as Paul was for most of last year, much less Paul of two years ago (when in any normal year the Rockets win the title pretty easily).   Then you get to issues of fit. CP3 fits quite well on the court with Harden - he's an excellent spot-up shooter and an enthusiastic and willing passer. Russ, on the other had, is not an excellent shooter and tends to pass only when he doesn't have anything approaching a makable shot.   So you're seeing both an objective talent downgrade and a downgrade in basketball fit.   Lastly:   &gt; Russ will have 12 minutes a night where it’s Westbrook time, and Harden will have 14. That means they only have to share the ball for half the game.  I don't know if this ever actually works, the idea that the team will play one way for most of the game and then completely shift gears and play in a different style when their star is on the bench. Maybe the Bad Boys Pistons did it, with Vinnie Johnson? Teams that are built around the signature talents of all time great (like Houston is with Harden) invariably seem to struggle when that star is on the bench, no matter who else they have. It's the same reason why the Warriors struggled when Curry was on the bench even though they had KD.   I don't know if you can ask Westbrook to be ""The Russell Westbrook show"" for 12 minutes and then, ""Mr. Supporting Player"" for another 20 - that kind of gear shift is really hard for most players, and nothing about Russ's style suggests that he'll be the rare exception.   Russ is going to make the non-Harden units good? If Chris Paul couldn't, why would you think Russ could?   Furthermore, remember that Russ being better than CP3 going forward doesn't mean that the team will be as good as the 2018 team. CP3 was great for that team - and that could easily be the level of team required to beat the Clippers or Milwaukee. I suspect Russ will be better than CP3 over the next two years - but neither of them will be as good as CP3 was."
Hey interesting post but I don’t agree with Some of the comments you’ve made.  1. Why do you think Stephen Curry will get injured? I understand he has had a history of injuries but I don’t think he would get injured especially with Russell running the ball mainly allowing Stephen Curry to make better shots and spend less energy.  2. If I recall correctly didn’t Steve Kerr go through surgery and spent a decent time off from coaching while Brown took over? I think they still had a remarkable record that year and continued to dominate the league especially people like Westbrook harden and Chris Paul.  3. I think draymond will remain a warrior forever and I don’t see mike brown being the laissez fair coach he is to impose any tension on his players especially with the history and success that they both share.  32-48 that sounds like the rockets record next season.
The same people who think 2019-2020 Russell Westbrook is still “great”
I know people are gonna downvote me but I don’t think anyone is scared of Russell Westbrook and James Harden.
"Last season, Harden had 40% usage and 40% assist rate. Russell Westbrook had 30% usage and 45% assist rate. Until they start playing with two balls at once, I would expect some massive declines.   &amp;#x200B;  Chris Paul's assist rate was basically twice as high when he played without Harden. Almost the same for Harden playing with and without CP3. It summed up to a high number per game, but not the highest. I would expect a kind of similar story for Westbrook."
[Off topic but my OCD is so mad at Russell Westbrook for this.](https://i.gyazo.com/aa35d3346479fc3a2b32f261c72c2f3c.png)
Russell Westbrook is out of his cotton picking mind.
“RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS OUT OF HIS COTTON PICKIN MIND”
"A certain team had Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook but couldn't pull it off."
"I think those people were sorely mistaken. It really isn't a debate about Embiid. But the difference between the rest of those guys and John Wall is that they can shoot (except for Westbrook), which is a pretty big deal in today's NBA. I know people always touted Wall as a pure PG, he was fast, could get to the rim and all of that. But without being able to shoot consistently, he's not gonna be on the level of all of those guys who can, much better than he can.  John Wall is probably the most similar to Russell Westbrook of anyone else on this list, but Russ is just better in pretty much every other regard. He's more athletic, a better scorer, a better passer, and (to me) shows more commitment to the game. And let's face it, John Wall was never going to do what Russ has done over the past couple of years.  To be honest, I don't know anyone in their right mind who would take 2017 John Wall over anyone on that 2nd tier - MAYBE Kemba, but even then I don't think so, with how important shooting has become."

"DefRTG is only allowed to use when you are trying to make a point of improved Russell Westbrook defense, it's useless otherwise."
"You are completely incorrect buddy. Russell Westbrook is the worst player to ever grace the courts of the modern nba. I mean look at his TS% (it's 50.1%)!!!! That is below the league average TS% of 55%!!   I mean those are numbers that belong in the CBA! It's pretty obvious you haven't and rely on the ""eye-test"" which is a load of crap. I don't even have to watch Westbrook play to know he is a scrub. The man shot 29% from three!!!!!!! That is absolute FUCKIN GARBAGE and SIGNIFICANTLY below league average of 35%!!! HOW I mean HOW can you shoot 29% IN THE MODERN NBA (DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON BEN SIMMONS)?!!!!??!!! LOOK AT HIS FT% TOO!!!! 65%??? ARE YOU FUCKIN KIDDING ME??? Russell Westbrook doesn't not BELONG in the NBA, MUCH LESS in the TOP 10!"
"He really lacked that Russell Westbrook consistency of consistently shooting 6 of 21 and being ""afk"" without ball and on defense."
"Good thing Russell Westbrook kept running into the traffic cones in the regular season and especially in the playoffs, lmao."
"But you see, Russell Westbrook Jr is a better basketball player than Carmelo Kyam Anthony"
"I don’t know who hurt you, but Russell Westbrook is an all time great PG and will be in the Hall if Fame."
"It is silly, but it's why we watch ya know. I feel like I *love* Timmy. That's my guy, my boyhood hero. You feel that way for Dirk.   There's something about being a small market/non-destination teams fan that makes guys like them, guys that just want to be there, such... heroes. Timmy, Dirk, Russell Westbrook. LeBron in Cleveland. Some of my favorite players right there. I really hope Giannis and Luka stay put for the long haul, too."
“Russell Westbrook and Harden will be the best duo in the NBA next year”
"Russ will make Harden play defence, quote me on this Russell Westbrook and Harden will be the best duo in the NBA next year"
Hey at least Semaj Christon made it in a important piece of OKC Thunder history when he scored on a Russell Westbrook assist to secure his NBA record 42nd triple double vs Denver on his MVP season.  That was special.
1. CP3  2. Lowry  3. Conley  4. Simmons  5. Westbrook  6. Kemba  7. Russell
Russell Westbrook is better
"Ah yes, dispelling the commonly held “Dennis Schroeder and Semaj Christon are better than Russell Westbrook” takes"
Yeah Start calling him Russell “Mr Triple Double” Westbrook
"There hasn't been a better fit than someone like Russell Westbrook playing for a franchise called ""Thunder"". Brodie in that blue jersey looked like Sonic blitzkrieging the opponent on every fucking possession. He's quick, unpredictable and banging like real thunder. A perfect match."
"It's a two-motion shot so it doesnt look as fluent as currys jumper for example. ray allen split his shot up as well and always shot with a lot of lift. Somenoe like Ray perfected this and was ultra quick anyways, but a textbook shot with a high release also has more room for error. In terms of midrange I feel James is really consistent and at his best unstoppable, but his 3ball seems streaky and werid lol. Another player struggling with a 2 motion shot (looks like this: players jump and put their arms in place, then lift higher and release at the highest point. a one shot motion like curry doesn't have the idle time between form and release and it all starts and ends simoultaneously) would be Russell Westbrook. Due to his insane athleticism he jumps super high on his jumpshots and recently has more and more trouble releasing at the correct moment. When you watch him you can often see that he's releasing the shot when he's already coming down from the apex of his jumper for example. LeBron adjusted his shot already in that regard as he used to jump really high in his early years as well. Now he pays more attention to his feet and combines a shorter jump with a quicker release. I feel like LeBron is a very mechanical player since he can perform his signature moves like a robot. His post-up turnaround fadeaway looks nearly identical anytime he does it and it feels like he can't miss them either. dunno what all of this has to do with his FT but just thought I'd share"
"Russell Westbrook would easily be able to ruin any team that ever existed. Celtics 60's, Lakers 80's, Bulls 90's, Lakers 00's, Lebron's Heat, Curry's GSW, easily. Just put him in any of these teams and they just fall apart. So Rockets are going to be a piece of cake for the most detrimental player to ever play the game."
And Russell Westbrook
"West  Frontcourt Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Rudy Gobert, Nikola Jokic  Backcourt James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic  East  Frontcourt Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Blake Griffin   Backcourt Ben Simmons, Kemba Walker, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Kyle Lowry, Malcolm Brogdon"
Never forget that everyday is Russell Westbrook day in OKC.
"Anthony Bennett, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook. What a trio."
He's like Russell Westbrook if you took away the rebounding and passing. And made him shoot worse.
Damn bron retired can’t wait to see my 3 favorite players on the thunder James harden Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook dominate the league
When the ~~Kevin Durant~~ ~~Kawhi~~ ~~Jimmy Butler~~ ~~Russell Westbrook~~ Chris Paul situation resolves itself.
I propose...[The Constipated One](http://sportige.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Russell-Westbrook-Funny.jpg)
"This is really an interesting take, simply because it hilariously scrutinize Russell Westbrook for no reason what so ever.   &gt; I agree he's positive, but I think the gap is widened by the fact that the offensive scheme and the roster are entirely built around Russ and his high usage.  &gt; It's hard to change your entire scheme and approach mid-game for a few minutes, so the Thunder offense tanks when he goes out. The WB offense doesn't work, because obviously, they don't have WB.   So essentially: Russell's huge offensive impact is inflated by the team running around him; this is a solid point, except you don't see the same argument applied to most players in the league:   Lebron James has had teams built perfectly around his strength since 2009, outside 2011 and 2019. Lebron's impact shot down when casts didn't fit his specific demand, yet people worship Lebron for his tremendous impact.   James Harden has had wide open spacing with perfect compatible players for most his tenure with the Rockets, you don't see this applied to Harden either.   I mean it's not like Russell's teammates are nearly as good of a fit as players like Harden, Giannis, Lebron, Jokic, etc simply because they can't shoot lick ( Thunder was 19th in shooting the deep ball, despite RW generating one of the most amounts of three's)  Once again, in essence, you are right in theory, but it's interesting that it's used against Westbrook of all people.    &gt; And they don't have another competent offensive system, because WB won't run any kind of normal motion offense.  This is trash lol.   Pick and roll is literally the most ""normal"" offense in the league lol  If you are strictly talking about more off ball actions than it has absolutely nothing to do with RW. He doesn't design the offense lol."
I was there before they were the Thunder and loved watching him grow.  [prebrand hat Russell Westbrook](http://imgur.com/ZOcD641)  So sad to see his last days here but wish him all the best
Idk why you’re laughing that’s exactly the truth. Most guys 6-6’3 are not Russell Westbrook athletic that goes without saying.
"Hey do you know/remember why the crowd was chanting RUSSELL at the end when they said ""It's been a long night for Russell Westbrook""? All I remember is KD's gamewinner from that game"
"It doesn't matter what your profession is. When you see someone do their job as passionately as Russell Westbrook, it inspires and elevates you."
"Hot take: Russell Westbrook is not better than Chris Paul, and the trade **lowers** the Rockets' ceiling. The main advantage Westbrook has is that he will likely play more games, since CP3 is injury prone at this stage.  CP3 is 80% of RW on offense, but 150%+ on defense. And he's better off-ball than RW too."
Bill Russell Westbrook Lopez
"This literally means nothing...  You are comparing an athletic all around scorer's points to a lock down defending scoring forward   Scoring is not Kawhi's strongest point Scoring IS Lebron's strongest aspect  Stats are IMHO easy ways for people who don't watch basketball to compare players. If stats were the #1 factor to determine a players ability. Oscar Robertson, Kareem and Russell Westbrook would be the best players in NBA history...... but they aren't"
Now that he’s on the Rockets expect to see “Here’s why Russell Westbrook is underrated” posts
Kind of like Russell Westbrook
Lakers / Pelicans (Zion primetime / AD vs. Pelicans / Lebron) Clippers / Rockets (Paul George vs. Russell Westbrook / Harden / Kawhi) Nets / Warriors (D'Angelo Russell?! / Great bench shots of KD) 76ers / Celtics
"As discussions between the Houston Rockets and the Oklahoma City Thunder on a blockbuster deal for Russell Westbrook grew serious Thursday, Daryl Morey, Houston's general manager, called James Harden to discuss how both stars might work together.

No it doesn't. The only thing it ignores is Westbrookstans' feelings.  Lost to Harden in the first round. 4-1  Lost to Gobert and Mitchell (a rookie) in the first round. 4-2  Lost to Dame and CJ while the Blazers were missing their second best player and fucking Kanter did work against them. 4-1  A top tier player does not win just 4 playoff games in three years. That is objectively bad. In the past three years Isiah Thomas has had more impact in the playoffs that Russell Westbrook. Literally the only other player of Westbrook's caliber that is comparable to him the past three seasons is Paul George. Turns out teaming up two second fiddles doesn't equal playoff success.
"Well Westbrook isn’t in Miami, but I still think the East will be pretty strong.   What will be interesting is seeing who starts at the “PG” position in GS. I’m guessing it will be Russell since I feel like he’s more of a true PG. Curry played SG in college."
Russell Westbrook is a Rockets legend. Never criticized him. Nope. Not once.
"Lemme tell you something, two years ago I guaranteed that Russell Westbrook would not retire a thunder to my friends and here we are today.   If its people who think like you in the 76ers front office who think its a bad idea to replace JJ Riddick with a better guard in Chris Paul then you will lose Joel Embiid."
"Honestly it's always been a ridiculous statement.  Even burner account KD praised Russ.  PG stayed in OKC for a huge reason because of Russ.  Even when he left he did so to join a contender with another friend of his (Kawhi), and made sure to talk it over and leave on good terms with Russ.  [Enes Kanter wrote a huge article praising Russ](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/enes-kanter-russell-westbrook-nba-mvp-2017), and him and Adams made a series of videos praising him."
Did you know that James Harden and Russell Westbrook played together at the Boys and Girls club together?
I don't think that many people realize how long Russell Westbrook and James Harden have known each other. They began balling together over 20 years ago.
"bro Russell won't get gassed nearly as quickly and is much more atheltic. He's still a killer defender when locked in. Our defensive coordination is great too, we have a system Westbrook will fit perfectly into"
I don't think that many people realize how long Russell Westbrook and James Harden have known and played with and against each other. The began balling together over 20 years ago.
"I'm not moving the goalposts. You just won't or can't understand historical context. These players don't have the same history Westbrook does. Barkley and Malone were *the guys* for their team and they are considered legends who just couldn't beat the greatest player of all time. Westbrook is a polarizing figure but what is objectively true is that Durant never won a championship playing with Westbrook and won two without him. The Rockets have advanced at least to the second round every season besides 2015-16 when they lost to the 73-9 Warriors. If they were suddenly worse with Westbrook, how much more damning could that be for his legacy?   And what if the Clippers won a title during this? I don't know if there is some comparison in another sport but there's nothing like that in the history of the NBA. Three Hall of Famers in their prime played alongside Russell Westbrook and every single one was significantly better off without him. A title as the second/1b guy would be huge but it wouldn't have the same value that it has for Kawhi, Curry, Dirk, and Wade. It would end the debate between if the Thunder or Westbrook were to blame for OKC failing to win a title but most people already take Westbrook's side. Four first round exits wouldn't simply be four first round exits; it would mean that despite all the awards and triple doubles, Westbrook was a player who made teams worse."
Plus potentially 7 games worth of the Patrick Beverly/Russell Westbrook blood feud
"'Can I put the tip in?'  'Well, you just got traded for Russell-fucking WESTBROOK, so I'm finally gonna say YES.'"
"Russell Westbrook, traded for a flock of nephews."
Paul George and Russell Westbrook
"Because you asked what would have the bigger impact. My point is the league has a storied history of dudes just like Russell Westbrook, guys with amazing stats and accomplishments but no championships, meaning that his legacy wouldn't be necessarily be impacted with further playoff failure.   Hence why I said winning it all would have a much bigger impact. Nobody would care if Russ had another 4 first round exits, in the end they would look back on him the way they look back on CP3, Malone, Barkley, Nash, and Mcgrady."
But those middle schoolers and high schoolers could be anything! They could even be a Russell Westbrook and Paul George!
 With Westbrook I think what we’re seeing now is - he'll do that thing where he drives left but always finishes right. And he may be one of the all-time catch and shoot guys from 3. I'm all in on Russell Westbrook.
How about if he gets traded to OKC for Russell Westbrook?
"Question to you, how are James Harden and Russell Westbrook or Curry and D'lo going to guard the elite guard duos in the league? All those guys are worse defenders than KCP, Caruso, Green and Bradley"

What does Russell Westbrook means to you?
"**Mike, Dan, and Tony :**  &gt; “do you like to shoot?”  [*Westbrook’s Reaction](https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Russell-Westbrook-e1474378904917.jpg)"
"Thunder fans will downvote you but this is partially true. The Thunder for many years had an absolutely transcendental offensive talent in Kevin Durant, and an MVP calibre player in a younger Russell Westbrook- yet only managed to have the league’s best offense one year. When teams have two players with the ability to win an MVP any given year of their prime, and only manage to have a league leading offense once, Something is up.   Why? Westbrook isn’t actually as good offensively as the box score stats suggest, Doesn’t really move off-ball, Was a streaky shooter but has devolved into a horrendous one, and despite being one of the better passers in the league he is prone to holding the ball till late shot clock and only then passing it for a below average shot.   He simply isn’t a winning player, and while the sub is currently going through a bit of a “Westbrook is actually all-NBA calibre” moment right now, I think after he shoots the Rockets out of a few winnable playoff games en route to a first round loss people will finally be able to tell it’s not just an OKC thing."
Those two guys are James motherfucking Harden and Russell motherfucking Westbrook.  This is not a problem for the Rockets.  This is a problem for any team playing the Rockets.
"I think its 3 factors, location, player and coach.  *Maybe they just didnt like the small market,  *Russell westbrook can make improvements to his game. *And the coach needs to help russ be the best he can be  I think PG and KD both saw that it wasnt just that they got beat, but that there wasnt much room for improvement with how Russ plays, and the coach hasnt been assertive as he should be to correct ineffectiveness"
"Now I know it's popular to pounce on Russell Westbrook, you're just gonna sit up there and say ""Harden wanted out, KD wanted his own team, and now Paul George left."" Ladies and gentlemen, I got news for y'all. I'm looking at Sam Presti -- Listen, if Sam Presti is reading, let me be very very clear, the man knows what he is doing. The man is incredibly adroit at his job. We understand what they do in drafts, picking up quality players, we get all of that -- but whether it's Sam Presti and his military-like style and stringent way of doing things and promoting team at the expense of individuals which might serve to alienate dudes, or whether its ownership, or whether its the city of Oklahoma that no body seems to want to stay in except for Russell Westbrook, THEN THE BOTTOM LINE IS CLEAR: Russell Westbrook had to go. I don't know if it's fair to judge Russell Westbrook harshly if he is in OKC, that might have everything to do with everybody's desire to be there. If Russell Westbrook was in Los Angeles would people have wanted to leave him? If Russell Westbrook was in New York would people be wanting to leave him? I appreciate Paul George coming out on Twitter or wherever the hell he came out in supporting Russell Westbrook. Because I really don't know if Russell Westbrook deserves blame here. I don't know if we can say that. Oklahoma City has a great fan base, walking into that arena and having those fans cheer for you, nothing wrong with that.  I'm not giving up on Russell Westbrook. He's a super star."
imagine being in 7th grade and getting traded for Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook is the more talented player and sometimes talent triumps fit. Even if they are not better this year, they are better for the next two years because Westbrook is younger and more durable."
"Dude averaged a triple double which hadn't been done in like 50 years. I know he's not perfect but he's still an elite level talent. Tbh as a fan of the Heat, this is the first time in awhile that I felt like a potential move was relatively no lose for us. I love our young guys and their potential so I'm more than happy keeping them. But at the same time if we made that trade we could get Russell freakin' Westbrook, 2 yrs removed from being MVP and still very much elite."
No one seriously thought a Russell Westbrook lead team was a contender. Stop it.
Russell Westbrook has already single-handedly ruined the value of a triple-double. That's what his legacy will be.
"Not sure I see Russell playing off-ball well, although Harden as experience with that. Probably the ideal scenario is to have Westbrook primarily handle fast-breaaks and let Harden handle half-court offense"
"yeah, but it's gambling on draft picks which are already gambles to begin with.  None of those teams have front offices that believe in tanking and are all well run orgs dedicated to winning.  On top of which, I think all but one of the picks is lotto protected.    I think the uncertainty is making people assume they might all be valuable, but there's a real possibility OKC traded Paul George and Russell Westbrook for eight 27th picks, an awful contract, an injury risk, and one good young player."
can't win with these cats  -russell westbrook
"Russell Westbrook, prime Derrick Rose and John Wall could do things like this too but it’s incredible seeing a bigger guard be that athletic."
He doesn’t have to be the GOAT to be the toughest to guard. So many point guards say Russell Westbrook is their toughest cover
Russell Westbrook is a top 10-15 player and got shown up by Ricky Rubio and rookie Donovan Mitchell
If Russell Westbrook isn't the most hated player in the league by volume the amount of vitriol his haters produce more than makes up for it.
"LeBron: Charizard. A rare find that's invaluable. A true force to be reckoned with, 120HP and that's no joke.  Kawhi: Machamp, because he's my champ   Steph: Mewtwo, ok so this one is exciting. A scientist created Mewtwo in a lab and that's really the only explanation we have for his incredible ability to hit 3's. Steph is also a great shooter too though.  James Harden: Arcanine, a truly fierce and polarizing opponent but not one that will get you to the final battle.  Giannis Antetokounmpo: Blastoise, one of the great cards to find in a deck. Don't be fooled by his size, this guy will put anyone that doubts him on full blast with his unexpected agility for such a big figure.  CP3: Electabuzz, because when this guy is on, he's fucking electrifying.  Kevin Durant: Gyrados, because he's a fucking brick shit house and breathes fire like it's his day job, besides being an uber driver.  Joel Embiid: Snorlax, because people sleep on this dude but he's a mountain of a man that makes the average man look like Curious George standing next to Donkey Kong.  Russell Westbrook: Machoke, cause...  Kristaps Porzingis: Drowzee, because he might not always look like he knows what he's doing but he's a good asset to have on your team  Kyrie Irving: Pikachu, because he seems nice but in reality, he's a real son of a bitch if you're playing against him."
"""Why Not?""  &amp;#x200B;  \- Russell Westbrook"
Rubio is a good player he shouldn't be schooling Russell Westbrook in his prime tho
"Lebron Curry KD Harden CP3 Kawhi AD Pau Gasol Draymond Green Russell Westbrook Kyrie Irving Paul George  If they keep up their play:  Embiid Jokic Giannis  That is just current. We are not talking about overlap players that have retired recently like pierce, KG, Shaq etc.  There are a ton of hall of famers in all era’s. That metric  is not worthwhile as you are playing against others of the era. Maybe a better metric would be did any of Jordan’s opponents have a summer job outside of basketball. We know players don’t now, we also know that players train since early childhood now. They did not in Jordan’s era.  Ya I think Jordan is better, but the minimizing of what Lebron plays against is disingenuous at best. If you constructed a 1995 dream team vs a 2015 dream team the more recent one would murder them."
"I don't understand why so many people around here think the NBA is some wild wild west and franchise players are gonna get randomly traded left and right lol.  its like the ""trade russell westbrook"" posts, sorry that's never gonna happen.   And LOL at Kyrie selling more Warriors tickets than Steph... delete this nephew."

So you guys don't want Russell Westbrook?
"Yes, Russell Westbrook"
Right next to Russell Westbrook

Russell Westbrook leads the league in threes taken and threes made
"The five basketball positions are Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, and Center. They all have a certain place where they are meant to stand. Here is a picture showing their location: https://m.imgur.com/a/s4lX41H. Naturally however, these positions need to move around to get open and make plays, but this is their natural position. Now I’m going to show what these positions do and what their qualities are. Look back at the picture every now and then to see where they stand, because it all ties in together.   1. Point Guard (pg) - The Point Guard stands at the front of the 3-point line and acts as the leader of the rest of the players. They are the ones that run plays and try to get a player a good shot. A good point Guard should be a good shooter (example: Stephen Curry, plays for warriors) and should also be good at driving to the rim (Russell Westbrook, plays for the thunder). At the same time, point guards have to be very good passers because they are trying to make plays (example: Magic Johnson, retired legend). Point Guards are usually not very tall and on the smaller side so they can get by their defenders.  2. Shooting Guard (sg) - A shooting guards job is pretty self explanatory. They shoot and they try to get good shots. As you can tell by their picture, a shooting guard is outside the three point line, but closer to the basket than point guards because they are on the side, also known as the wing. Of course, they’re also trying to be making plays just like the pg, however they’re main goal is to be a good shooter so that when they get the ball they can score a basket. Some good examples are Klay Thompson and James Harden both of which are playing in the nba now. Shooting guards are usually more tall than point guards so that they can get good shots using height advantage, however they are not the tallest on the court, we’ll get to that later.   3. Small Forward (sf) - These are very versatile and athletic players. They are on the wing as well, opposite of the shooting guard, and they’re job can be to shoot (example: Kevin Durant, currently plays for the warriors) or to drive to the basket (example LeBron James, currently plays for the Lakers). They are usually strong and well built, while also pretty tall.   4. Power forward (pf) - If you look at the picture, you can now see we are inside of the three point line and next to the basket. The power forward and the center and meant to be the tallest on the court, so that they can get rebounds from the basket and so they can score next to the basketball by laying it in or dunking. Power forwards are usually meant to be strong and tall (examples: Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan, both retired).  5. Center (c) - The tallest on the court. Their job is similar to the power forward, and that is to get rebounds and score close to the basket. There are many legends that were centers, and some I’d recommend to look at are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O’Neal. Some other legends are Bill Russell (has the most champions won ever with 11) and Wilt Chamberlain (has literally the most insane stats you can imagine), but they both played in the 50s and you can’t get any good recording of them playing, so I wouldn’t worry about it.   For your height and body build I’d suggest you be a point Guard. That means you need to work on your shot (make sure you are shooting correctly. When i started my form was awful and i shot two handed for a long time. Before you fix your form, you’ll never be able to shoot consistently. Look up YouTube videos or ask friends to help if you have any that shoot well). This also means you need to dribble very well (example: Kyrie Irving, currently plays for the Celtics, and Allen Iverson, retired legend). You also need to decide what kind of point Guard you want to be. Do you want to shoot from far like Stephen Curry or Damian Lillard, or are you athletic and explosive and would be able to drive to the basket like Russell Westbrook. I’d suggest you first work on your shot, work on dribble moves, and work on driving to the basket, and then learn what you are good at.   Best of luck! Remember: YouTube is a gold mine for tutorials. I use it almost every time I go to a basket to see what I’m going to work on."
Since when do people abbreviate Russell Westbrook as RW?
"So hold on, you say that Harden carried his team, his team would be a lottery team without him etc but then in the same paragraph, disparage Russell Westbrook who dragged a carcass of a team to the playoffs, whilst averaging a triple double?   &amp;#x200B;  I agree with some of your points in the OP but you are coming at this with such a painful bias, that it's hard to take seriously. Giannis was an integral part of a Bucks team that topped out in the Eastern Conference, he was top 3 in Defence/Offence etc. There have been sketchier MVP decisions in the past, including Harden/WB, but this I dont feel is one of them."
He won by a landslide. Also the mvp does not always go to the best player on the best team. I’ll list a couple of examples  Russell Westbrook  Allen iverson  Tim Duncan  Steve Nash  Michael Jordan   As for defence giannis is a great defender do not get me wrong but kawhi has a much larger affect on defence just because of his hands and awareness are so much better a perfect example would be that sixers series where he nullified Ben Simmons passing ability.    As for your comment on enabling his team to be better as much as harden does that is not true. The rockets core was injured for much of this year and they are not as well coached as the bucks who were also among the best 3 point shooting teams this year. A shot that giannis doesn’t contribute much to. But he benefits from the space a chris Middleton or brook Lopez creates on the floor. Giannis is a great player who benefits from his team. James harden is a great player who benefits his team by being its entire engine. With no offence from harden this team is a lottery team. It giannis is not scoring there are all star caliber players and healthy solid guys available to step up all the time. James harden is the MVP because he didn’t have that luxury and used his game to make up for it.
That’s fair seeing how he just has 1 .. but I think stephs first MVP he should have gotten .. Russell Westbrook’s ..and this one .. Westbrook and giannis were really close  and hard to decide so I see why he didn’t .. but if I had a vote he would have gotten it 4 times
"Derrick Rose, Paul George, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan"

Dude the disrespect on this sub toward Russell Westbrook is unbelievable. Some people have really convinced themselves he’s not a top 5 PG

"Isn’t that a dumb way of arguing who’s better all time though?  Like if Shaq was playing in the 60’s at that size and talent wise he would probably be putting up 50 and 20. But Bill Russell and Wilt are ranked above him even though he probably had more skill than they did.  Same thing with an athletic freak like Westbrook, he’d dominate competition then and skill wise probably had more than Oscar Robertson but everyone calls Robertson better.  Accomplishments, acheievements against your competition and accolades all matter way more than “skill” if we’re talking pure skill then the majority of the 60’s and 70’s players should not be rated that highly as the game has advanced so much. An average star like Middleton would probably dominate then."
Russell Westbrook has entered the chat
lol rebounds are a worthless stat. especially in which the manner guys like LeBron and Russell Westbrook pad their rebound stats.
I think Russell Westbrook deserves to be ahead of Chris Paul. Dude has a finals appearance and an MVP award and has averaged a triple double for the past 3 seasons despite no one else doing so in 60 years.

Idk but last night it was Jrue Holiday vs. Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook was a franchise player in OKC because he yanked the wheel out of KD's hands and drove them off a cliff into mediocrity
"""Where are you sending the double team from to double him before the catch? ""  AC Green...Samaki Walker...Nick Anderson etc. Mentioned it in one of the comments already but Shaq in the 06 finals averaged 0.71 ppp on post up plays (0.89 on single coverage)... worse than a Russell Westbrook off the dribble three. The ppp you are going to generate on Shaq post ups is going to be league average at best. The ppp that he is going to give up trying to guard Curry/Harden/Lillard etc will be sky high"
So the way the jazz would generate points is by Karl Malone trying to score on post ups when double teamed. For comparison Shaq averaged 0.71 ppp on post ups in the 06 finals. Thats worse than a Russell Westbrook three. As the defense I would gladly settle for that.
"&gt; Robert fucking Parish  &gt; Russell Westbrook  &gt; Pau Gasol   I'm sorry, I can't even read the rest of the list. I actually hate to say this even, because in my opinion Pau and Westbrook are some of the most underrated/unfairly hated on players by NBA fans. But you clearly value different things in a basketball career than me, and it seems a lot of other people. Just gonna leave it at that."

It was always Westbrook. Right now people will tell you Lillard. Next season it’ll be Russell again
That sounds like a stat I would have in the rec league. I play with the effort of russell westbrook for 3 minutes and then I coast the rest of the game because I'm exhausted
"All in their primes or at the level they were at the time?  If it's the latter then not great. Allen Iverson would be treated the way Russell Westbrook is today, maybe even worse since at least Westbrook is a legit good play maker."
"I would argue that with the defensive rule changes you dont need someone that can guard him straight up. The reason you see teams using the post less and less is because it is one of the least efficient offensive play types. Per the 17-18 season it was the second least efficient shot https://shottracker.com/images/articles/ST_Chart2.png at 0.88 points per possession. So you might argue that coaches are moving away from post play because of the lack of skilled low post players. Lets evaluate that as well.  Looking at Shaqs 06 finals stats (https://www.nba.com/finals2006/stats/shaquille_oneal.html) he averaged 0.71 ppp on post up plays (0.89 on single coverage). Thats worse than a Russell Westbrook off the dribble three.  Keep in mind that with the defensive rule changes you are allowed to double team a post player before they even catch the ball and can send a hard double and have a third defender hedge to intercept any pass out. None of this was allowed in Shaqs prime. That is the reason Marc Gasol who is one of the greatest post players of all time only averaged  0.59 ppp in the playoffs on his post ups (worse than a Marcus Smart 3 pointer). The post up is an inefficient play.   Now lets look at the other side of the ball which is defense.Centers in the modern game need to cover the entirety of the halfcourt and not just the space around the hoop. You can’t give Kemba/Lillard/Curry/Harden an inch of space off a screen, centers need to be able to switch onto guards and at least momentarily discourage the 3-point attempt. I am a kings fan and i can tell you that the kings almost beat the lakers by running Bibby+Vlade pnrs 8 times a game because Shaq just couldnt step up to hedge/trap the guard. What happens when he has to defend a James Harden + Capela pnr? In summary the reason I would take Hakeem over Shaq in todays game is because his offensive and defensive skillset would be more suited to todays game"
"Basketball Reference on Hall of Fame chances: Chris Paul: 100% Russell Westbrook: 99.7% Kyle Lowry: 65.2% Kyrie Irving: 61.5% Rajon Rondo: 40.7% Damian Lillard: 36.4%   Something interesting to think about - Kyle Lowry's been the only other All-star on an NBA Championship team, and an ECF team that lost to an all-time great Championship team (featuring an all-time great, and 2 other perennial All-stars, potential Hall of Famers).    Westbrook's been to the Finals once and lost - was the 2nd best player on that team (been Harden's per minute numbers off the bench were ridiculous).  Since then, Westbrook has had playoff failures, and playoff stinkers equal to Lowry.  Westbrook's also been surrounded by and played with more All-stars than Lowry.    Hall of Fame voters won't remember the above.  But I don't think any Raptors fans would take Westbrook over Lowry on this team or the ECF Raptors (Westbrook next to Demar would have been a clusterfuck)."
"Well that's not just any reporter, that's the legendary Rick Barry. Now if it was Berry Tramel saying so to Russell Westbrook, shit would definitely go left quick lol."
This makes me wonder if anybody will be able to accomplish a quintuple double? Maybe Russell Westbrook with Turnovers?
Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double through 246 games
"You obviously don’t know anything about our fan base. Russell Westbrook just hates playing at Vivint Smart Home because he seems to let fans get in his head, and in Utah they sell out all the seats and get rowdy. You’re obviously going off his complaint this year. The fan he complained about got banned for life. Can’t label a whole fan base off one piece of trash person. LA had a racist prominent figure remember? Donald Sterling?"
 Russell Westbrook would be a champion if he faced the same Golden State Emergency Room that the Raptors did.   How long are we gonna continue this lie Fred Bum Vleet actually “won” a legitimate “championship”.
"Garnett can’t fight.   Charlie was probably the only big dude he started on.   He arced up at Dwight Howard and head butted him. Howard threw him off easilly and laughed.   Garnett is a legend of the game. But like Russell Westbrook, Rajon Rondo, Nurkic and a few others. He can talk a whole gang of shit but the moment something pops off he either deliberately falls over or only starts looking for blood once there’s 25 people between he and the other guy"

Russell Westbrook apparently changed his name from Kevin Durant at some point
Young Russell Westbrook was a Second Team All-NBA player (by his third season in the league). Are you really saying Morant's *floor* is second team all NBA?
"  His contested rebounds per game is the highest amongst player's that are under 6'4 and second amongst players that are under 6'7 (second only to PJ Tucker). He also ranks as the highest guard in the league in the same stat. That can't possible be meaningless?    His rebound chance is the best for players under 6'10, and ranks highly amidst the true bigs when the parameters include the whole league. As per the contributor of the stat, rebound chance determines;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; The number of times player was within the vicinity (3.5 ft) of a rebound. Measures the number of rebounds a player recovers compared to the number of rebounding chances available as well as whether or not the rebound was contested by an opponent or deferred to a teammate.   &amp;#x200B;     So for each of these rebound chances, he is in position to rebound the ball. Above many players in the league. In position to hustle for the loose ball or rebound, even if his man is not there to do so. The league reports Steven Adams has a rebound chance of around 18, which still ranks in the top 15 of the league. He is not having his soul drained for the purpose of Russ' stats.  &amp;#x200B;  Even more important is [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) tracks Adjusted Rebound % which they define as follows;  &gt; Percentage of rebounds gathered when given a rebound chance; excludes all deferred rebounds   &amp;#x200B;    As expected, except by you apparently, Russell Westbrook boasts a % of 69.7%. Which is good for 5th overall in the NBA and best among guards. He is beaten by Kevin Love, Lauri Markannen, Aaron Gordon, and Kevin Durant. He collects the most rebounds out of all of these players, has more contested rebounds per game than Kevin Durant, and is within 1.9% of first place. He ranks above notable rebounders such as; Giannis, Drummon, Davis, and Deandre Jordan.   &amp;#x200B;    So the stats paint Russ as a rebounder who is always in position, and collects an extremely efficient number of rebounds per chance. Especially relative to his size and position. His contested rebound percentage is the best among guards and second among players under 6'10 (to PJ Tucker, a notable hustler and rebounder). Even excluding deferred rebounds, he hangs in the most elite strata of rebounders.   &amp;#x200B;    If we want to say the stats don't paint him as a winning player we can look to his regular season stats in which he ranks Top 10 in the league for VORP, BPM, OPM, DPPM. His advanced rebounds stats as mentioned before demonstrate is a historically good rebounding guard and contends with the bigs in the leagues in terms of chances, and converted chances. If we're being logically consistent, it's hard not to accept that he is a winning player. If you love the stats so much, here they are."
"Yes, Russell Westbrook is amore athletic \[replace with almost any player\], scoring wise."
"As a player in this era you can choose who you want to play with. He chose Russell Westbrook. For example, he could have chosen the 76ers and played with Simmons, Embiid and Covington and enjoyed much more success. I am not going to give him a pass for making a bad choice, that’s also a part of basketball. If you aren’t lucky to be in a situation to win, you have to put yourself in a situation to win."
"I'm not going to say who is more athletic, because that's partly subjective and also I don't know all the stats, but based on the eye I'd say you could argue for the following players:  Giannis, Dennis Smith Jr, Russell Westbrook. LeBron, Oladipo, John Wall when they are healthy.   Like I said, I'm not saying those guys are definitely more athletic, but I think they deserve to be in the discussion with Zion if we are talking about overall athleticism"
"Right now, Chris Paul gets the edge over Russell Westbrook, but if Russell keeps going at a high level, he will pass CP. I like Dikembe Mutombo as a sleeper, too."
"In your opinon, which seems to have little value given the complete lack of basketball IQ you've demonstrated in your last couple of comments. Unquestionable first ballot HOFer and former MVP Russell Westbrook is ass? Keep hating on greatness instead of just appreciating an incredibly talented and gifted player.  &amp;#x200B;  Personally, I rank him at 10th when you consider KD's injury just above Klay and Jimmy assuming that no one obvious was left out of your original 12 man list. Sure, you could argue that Klay and Jimmy are better but it's definitely not a given. Just admit that the extent of your NBA knowledge comes from r/nba hot takes and we can both get on with our nights."
jayson tatum russell westbrook are kobe's sons and they make him proud
Russell Westbrook
"Lol russell westbrook cant really get his own shot because he cant shoot, this from a westbrook fan. The bucks biggest need is perimeter shooters."
Russell Westbrook
"KD is the same dude who called out everyone but Westbrook on his burner accounts. He’s the same guy that told Nick Collison and Russell Westbrook he was staying and left a week later. He’s the same guy that called out a teenager in social media.   Maybe a good teammate, but questionable character."
Russell Westbrook nods
"The way shannon is saying this, he's essentially saying that guys like dame lillard, ben simmons are not superstars. He raised the ""superstar"" bar to super elite player. which... is basically just a TV debate trick. I mean, if zion is a 25/10 human highlight reel I think most people here would say thats a super star. especially with the attention he'd get. But Shannon is saying that's not a super star, that's just a star. A super star is hyper-production (lebron, magic).  &amp;#x200B;  This was probably just done so that skip could make his take. I mean, they casually said hes an ""80lbs heavier russell westbrook"" and also draymond at the same time. lol ok. Because zion ""can swoop"". This is just a nonsense segment built for skip to talk"
"Ja's style of play is also more fitting to the NBA. If he gets a consistent jumpshot, dude has the potential of being at future top 3 PG in the league.  IMO his ceiling is John Wall-ish, hell I'll get downvoted to hell for this, but I'd even say Russell Westbrook with less rebounding at the moment."
"Oscar Robertson so overrated man. Inflated stats because he played in the 60s.   Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double now for three straight years, doesn’t make him the second best pg of all-time."
"So pretty much Russell Westbrook, definitely won’t be a bust."
&gt;Russell Westbrook is clearly visible to the public  Why you gotta do me like this?
Russell Westbrook is clearly visible to the public
Russell Westbrook vetoed the Bol Bol pick - OKC can only have one crazy motherfucker with that kind of fashion sense.
"You literally just posted statistics so I'm convinced you didn't actually watch him. You probably read some article hating on him and adopted it as your own opinion. Everything I said is true, and he has a ton of potential. You're the same type of person who said the Thunder drafting Russell Westbrook was a mistake because you only looked at statistics and Op-eds."
"It’s whoever let’s Russell dominate the offense so much’s fault.   Westbrook has been criticized for not giving all star wings and guards (two top 10 players) enough touches.   No way in hell hes gonna give a largely rotational big man 8-10 iso’s a game.   This isn’t disparaging Adams, btw, I think he has the strength and touch to have developed into a 20/10 guy. He’s at 14 ppg as is ffs.   He could *easily* get 6 more a game if he’d been developed as a legit scoring option in the offense.   OKC doesn’t run offense tho."
Most of the times both teams have atleast 1 superstar (only a few teams had no superstar and even came to that point tho). So we actually could start to laugh at Russell Westbrook or Harden for being 0-1 in the finals. But it wouldnt be worth since its just... well 1 finals appearance.
"Using the term ""low-key"" when if anything, you're actually being ""high-key"".  Not knowing how abbreviations work. Basketball IQ as BBIQ: do you people not know it's basketball, not basket ball? Russell Westbrook as RWB or WB: again, just because a word or name sounds like it's two words, that doesn't mean that it is."

Russell Westbrook too
"Joel Embiid, Russell Westbrook, then maybe someone like Jalen Rose?"
"Man it’s almost like James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka all on one team. How incredible that would be!"
"John Wall  + Troy Brown Jr + 2020 1st  For   Russell Westbrook + 2020 2nd    Wizards get Westbrook paired back with Beal and old coach Scott Brooks.   Thunder get to tank for a season, add additional 2020 pick, then likely have a top 5 pick come in the following year and be able to have a star player in prime years if he can be healthy return with a young reloaded core. 2 birds 1 stone. Acquire a star in return while also being able to tank and draft for a year."
Russell Westbrook?
How to beat recent Russell Westbrook in the playoffs. Have a center. Doesn't have to be a particularly good center. Dude just can't score efficiently even against fucking Enes Kanter. This is the guy who got pick and rolled to death everytime he saw the floor in the regular season.
Lol Paul George is only going to miss the very beginning of the season if he misses any time at all. Lol my bad I for some reason assumed you had a tiny bit of knowledge of what you were talking about. So yeah so Kawhis load management won’t be an issue with that at all. [Source](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-injury-updates-thunder-stars-russell-westbrook-finger-knee-paul-george-shoulder-both-undergo-offseason-surgery/amp/)   Lol 😂 everything you say is completely wrong.
"Russell Westbrook finished third in the MVP race, as a player for the Miami Heat"
"No one:   /u/NSGWP_Mods: PEOPLE ON THIS SUB HAVE SUCH A WEIRD BONER FOR WESTBROOK IT'S INSANE TO ME. DUDE SUCKS AND IS ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE WORST PLAYERS IN THE ENTIRE NBA TO HAVE ON YOUR TEAM IF YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO WIN A RING. I WOULD RATHER SIGN KYLE KORVER FOR THE VET MIN THAN RUSSELL WESTBROOK FOR THE VET MIN. AT LEAST IF YOU SIGN SOME TERRIBLE PLAYER HE'S GOING TO SIT ON THE BENCH AND STFU. YOU SIGN WESTBROOK HE'S GONNA DOMINATE THE BALL AND TAKE 30 SHOTS AND HIT 8 OF THEM. DUDE STRAIGHT UP SUCKS FOR WINNING BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS, PERIOD."
"And in 2021 anything can happen. Who knows? Maybe they could even spend that cap space on a player with the talent level of Russell Westbrook! That'd be pretty cool, right?"
Russell Westbrook averages a quadruple double
Russell Westbrook
Man just called Russell Westbrook a top 3 pg💀💀💀💀
1. Kevin Durant 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. LeBron James 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Steph Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. James Harden 8. Nikola Jokic 9. Paul George 10. Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook does not hurt his own team.
They can get [this picture](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/russell-westbrook-of-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-goes-up-for-a-dunk-picture-id461744270) but like every day
"&gt;Well who else is gonna be the primary ball. Handler? Thunder couldn't even get Shooters around Westbrook outside of PG.  I'm not saying they should have signed another PG and played him off ball. I'm just saying that's inflated his assist percentage.   &gt;Im not saying it's the only defensive metric that matters. But it shows he's undervalued by fans as a defensive PG.  I completely disagree. He's not a good defensive point guard.   &gt;You're whole point is that Westbrook is the one who's overrated defensively just bc the team is good. Not that he's part of it but he's being carried by it. That's just a false narrative.  How is it false narrative? He is surrounded by a DPOY contending wing defender, a great time protector/regular season defender in Adams, Grant is a really good defender, Ferguson is a really good defender, Noel is a solid defender etc etc  It's the same with Donovan Mitchell. He's an average or probably slightly below average defender covered by a fantastic defensive team and it catapulted him into top 10 DWS. It's just not a good stat.   &gt;According to data Forbes’ Brett Knight compiled for his lists of the NBA’s most overpaid and underpaid players, Russell Westbrook was actually overpaid last season. Knight adapted a methodology created by Southern Utah University economist David Berri, estimating the value of a win and multiplying that figure by an estimate of how many wins a player produced to determine what that player’s salary should be. To determine the number of wins a player generated, Knight averaged each player’s figures for Wins Produced, Win Shares and an estimate based on Value Over Replacement Player.  Yeah I just don't know like what the stats formula actually, what it says comparatively about the rest of the league etc. I might look it up a bit later.   &gt;Lastly people rate him badly based off his athleticism... Does lebron not rely on his at an older age to score? Should we not pay lebron bc his shooting is reliant on athleticism as well.  LeBron is 6'8 and like 250 pounds it's completely different lol  He's also better at basically every aspect of basketball. It's a stupid comparison.  &gt;It's also not like he just sits on the couch and says fuck it I'm not gonna try to fix anything. Theres already proof he's in the gym trying to fix his jumper again.  There is proof of that every off season. And yet, it continues to get worse.   &gt;He's also one of the last players with the killer instinct while a lack thereof has plagued players like lebron  Jesus what the fuck are you even talking about."
Russell Westbrook know the Earth is spherical.
If you dont think westbrook is overall a net positive on your own team.. im baffled. Bud is a highly competent coach and will tailor his game plan to utilize russell and giannis favorably.
"people don’t like talking about the *entire* Russell Westbrook  those triple doubles just like...happened, man!"
Russell Westbrook and Blake Griffin plus good role players? Sounds good
"We are trying to determine which player is better, comparing seasons in which they were the sole star. The very WORST team Russell was on (first round exit) we agree is on par with the very BEST team AI was on (finals) based solely on postseason success. You say the difference is the competition but i think both the raptors and the bucks were very good teams that the 76ers still overcame. Westbrook has never won a playoff series as the only star and even with paul george got bounced in the first round. So in my opinion, which is what we are discussing opinion, Allen Iverson is the better player then Russell Westbrook. That doesnt mean i think Westbrook is bad it just means i think Iverson is better."
&gt; I have never watched Russell Westbrook and thought he is an elite finisher. On the other hand I Have thought that about Kemba Walker.   Mind if i ask why? I always assumed this sentiment was the other way around for most
Russell Westbrook
Yeah our delusional sub thinks Jimmy Butler and Russell Westbrook is anything better than a 1st round exit.
"Alright. That’s fair. And I haven’t dissected the stats for this specific argument. It’s just after so many years of nba basketball, I have never watched Russell Westbrook and thought he is an elite finisher. On the other hand I Have thought that about Kemba Walker."
"So, by your logic, you are agreeing with me. Russell Westbrook should take less shots so he can be efficient and stop bricking away his team’s chances at playoff wins."
&gt;Russell Westbrook is the model of the American success story. Born into nothing and working his way up in the world through hard work and and determination. Now he’s a multimillionaire who takes care of his community  Literally Lebron except he wins
"Okay, so you are copy-pasting [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholascrain/2019/06/25/oklahoma-city-thunder-2018-19-season-evaluation-russell-westbrook/#62dea6267ca9) in your replies. Got it!"
"Even in his prime, Chris Paul was in the [150-200 attempt range from 0-3 feet](https://stats.nba.com/player/101108/shooting/?Season=2012-13&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season). Most years Russell Westbrook is [over 500 FGA from that range](https://stats.nba.com/player/201566/shooting/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season). Even taking out the Harden factor it's never been close."
"Paul George had career numbers playing with Russell Westbrook and despite what people believe should've happened in this situation or that situation, Kevin Durant won an MVP with Russell.  I'll let you tell me which other players Russell should've been regularly feeding non-stop in OKC."
"He is a very good rebounder, see his grades here:  &gt; https://www.bball-index.com/player/russell-westbrook/  This takes into account the value of both contested and uncontested rebounding and rates them according to statistical value."
Pretty sure I for one am a worse basketball player than Russell Westbrook
"As a Houston fan, do you actually want Westbrook? No disrespect to Russell but I’m surprised"
"According to data Forbes’ Brett Knight compiled for his lists of the NBA’s most overpaid and underpaid players, Russell Westbrook was actually overpaid last season. Knight adapted a methodology created by Southern Utah University economist David Berri, estimating the value of a win and multiplying that figure by an estimate of how many wins a player produced to determine what that player’s salary should be.

Not that he's part of it but he's being carried by it. That's just a false narrative.  Don't disagree about threes. But he played with a coach who can't run a play to save his life or adjust a game plan. Not to mention thunder have never had a coach who held Westbrook responsible for his actions in game.  As for the data: ""According to data Forbes’ Brett Knight compiled for his lists of the NBA’s most overpaid and underpaid players, Russell Westbrook was actually overpaid last season. Knight adapted a methodology created by Southern Utah University economist David Berri, estimating the value of a win and multiplying that figure by an estimate of how many wins a player produced to determine what that player’s salary should be.

With his work ethic and attitude it's easier to gamble on him fixing shit than 99% of the nba. He's also one of the last players with the killer instinct while a lack thereof has plagued players like lebron"
"AI had no one spreading the floor, Russell Westbrook has had KD Harden Oladipo Jackson Paul George even Schroeder is a decent shot, they may have the same efficiency but that does not tell the whole story and you know it. AI had way better defenders on him too they leave Russell open for so many shots and he still doesn’t hit them. What would Russell shoot if he had prime Kobe on him, two players could have the same per or win shares and that doesnt mean they are equally skilled your teammates and opponents have a huge effect on those numbers. Like people have hyped Toronto for years but the nature of their schedules and every other team having to travel to a different country to play them does have an effect or Denver has low key always had a huge advantage based solely on their altitude. There are never ending layers to analysis."
"Just thought it was cool, it’s the offseason, and I was sick of the Russell Westbrook posts."
"I like Russell Westbrook. But when assembling a team trying to win a ring, would you pick him as your starting point guard?   What about Steph, CP3, Kemba, Damian Lillard, even Kyle Lowry and Ben Simmons?   I know it’s disrespectful for all he’s achieved but he’s had great teams with KD, Harden, PG but does not gel well with others. His style and energy I believe doesn’t team up well and that’s very hurtful to your chances, especially for a point guard."
"Yeah ok sure I'll bite on each of these.   &gt;Westbrook also led the entire NBA in assist percentage at 46.5 percent.  Yeah he's a very good passer. But a lot of that is also due to the fact (and this has been the case ever since Durant left) a lot of the thunder possessions are just Westbrook dribbling the ball for 20 seconds then either shooting or passing to s guy who has to shoot. He's a very good drive and dump passer to find the roll man just on his hip/behind him but this stat is inflated by a lot of possessions where he is just standing with the ball for a long time then passing it  He is a very good passer.  &gt;Westbrook racked up 1.9 steals per game, good for fifth in the entire league. His 5.0 defensive win shares were fourth in the NBA, one spot above George.  He's always been a good steals guy, it's the rest of his defense that's suspect. That's why defensive metric always overrated him. He plays on a good defensive team with great defensive players (defensive stats are bad at distinguishing which players are helping on the floor out of the 5 guys), he gets a lot of steals by gambling (defense always overrates steals/blocks guys).   According to win shares (the stat you're using) westbrook was nearly 5x more valuable defensively than he was offensively. That's just stupid. Basketball reference has him 5th, NBA.com has him 33rd. Either way you calculate it, he's being overrated. Just look at the rest of the list you got it from :  Andre Drummond lead the league lol  James harden is apparently the 15th best defender in the league.   Guys like vucevic, whiteside and jokic are apparently better defenders than Embiid.   Do you think it's random that 3 thunder players and three jazz players are all in the top 20 players in the league? Or do you think it's, as I've said before, the stat can't figure out individual defense and overrated people that are on a great team defense playing next to really good defenders?  &gt;he shot 36.7 percent on corner 3’s last season. Not completely irrelevant given he's played under a shit system and a horrid spineless coach  Yeah that's all well and good. Hopefully that continues. But he also shot 29% on threes last season. That's just awful. He shouldn't have been taking 5 threes a game.    &gt;According to this data, Russell Westbrook’s production in the regular season was worth $34,390,553 which is 1,263,597 more than the $35,654,150 he made.   Idk what data that is from.   I don't really buy it, but idk what it is so I can't really comment on it.   I think the big downward swing in his production is worrying though, considering he is owed $170 million dollars for his age 30-34 seasons and is incredibly (possibly more than anyone else on the league) reliant on his athleticism"
russell westbrook also doesn’t like passing the ball
Russell Westbrook doesn’t play winning Basketball.  REAL TALK.
"Russell Westbrook has never had any substantial problems with team chemistry ever, that’s just a complete fabrication."
"Judging the best athletes pound for pound in NBA history is subjective. Relative to height and weight, how do you declare Russell Westbrook the pound for pound best athlete over guys like Spud Webb or Nate Robinson? Westbrook is 6’3 200 pounds with a 37 inch vertical. Spud Webb had a 46 inch vertical and he was only 5’7 132 pounds"
I really enjoy watching Russell Westbrook. I am also really glad he isn’t on my team
Russell Westbrook has never made the finals.
I’ve seen multiple comments today that they’d rather have Jrue Holiday than Russell Westbrook.  This whole subreddit is delusional
"These people just love him cos he plays hard and his teammates ""snake him"" (in their opinion)  Dude is straight up trash when it comes to winning basketball. I would rather have Danny Green than Russell Westbrook for the same money because at least Danny Green isn't going to shoot 25 shots and make 6.  If Russell can let someone else handle the ball and not take bad shots I would change that statement. But he won't."
It makes sense for a New York or a Miami to bring in Westbrook. Get a big name player in a big name market to avoid tanking and keep a steady revenue stream. But no contender should ever take Russell Westbrook and his contract. He’ll raise your teams regular season floor but absolutely lowers your championship ceiling.
Russell Westbrook plz
"Let's look at other stats for someone in his role shall we?  Westbrook also led the entire NBA in assist percentage at 46.5 percent. This is a stat that estimates the percentage of field goals made by a team that a particular player assisted on while he was in the game, excluding their own field goals. 3rd season in a row  Westbrook racked up 1.9 steals per game, good for fifth in the entire league. His 5.0 defensive win shares were fourth in the NBA, one spot above George.  he shot 36.7 percent on corner 3’s last season. Not completely irrelevant given he's played under a shit system and a horrid spineless coach  last season Westbrook played roughly 47.0 percent of his minutes at shooting guard, by far the most of his career.  Think about how big of a learning curve to play off ball it is for someone late in their career  Is he overpaid? Yes. Even according to data that someone has used to determine underpaid vs overpaid. But in today's NBA most players are overpaid. According to this data, Russell Westbrook’s production in the regular season was worth $34,390,553 which is 1,263,597 more than the $35,654,150 he made. "
"because they have blake who looked like a beast last year, they may want to go all in on putting as much talent as they can around him. youre not gonna find a higher reward option out there that they can afford then russell westbrook"
Russell Westbrook averages 27-9-10 because he's the most blatant stat padder to ever play the sport
Russell Westbrook.  He isn't gonna leave after KD left.
"Disagree with almost the entire first half of what you said. Ppl werent mad that he was grabbing the rebounds. They were mad because those rebounds (and the way they were gotten like constantly leaving his man open to chase it) were used as a means to justify him getting a major award in the nba (MVP) despote being on a sixth seed who finished around the same amount of wins as analysts wrre projecting that they would at the start of the season, especially when the main difference between him and Harden was 2 rebounds per game. The triple double average has served as a means for thunder fans to ignore otherwise poor play and decison-making from Russ instead of acknowledging his flaws as a player because ""he gives his all every night."" Beyond that, the trip-doub is used as a means to rank Russell higher in (admittedly subjective) rankings despite that this ""only-seen-once-before"" level of play has time and time again failed to grant him any postseason success besides simply making the playoffs since he lost the second best player on the planet.   Beyond that, Russell does try to draw fouls quite frequently. He's one of the main perpetrators of the kick-the-leg out jumpshot where he'll fall after little to no contact. And r/nba doesnt want him to. R/nba hates foul drawing with a passion in volumes unless it comes from players they like (namely Giannis) and Westbrook doesnt meet that short list.   The westbrook hate is more a correlation of the rise of his status due to the triple double average and how people attempt to use it as a cover-up for any of his falts as a player.   That all said, he is undoubtably a hall of famer so youre correctly right there."
No team wanting to have any success and healthy chemistry should never ever contain Russell Westbrook. That's like rule number 1
Don't waste your time. Lardbiscuits chimes in on every Westbrook thread to slam the contract and make it known that he doesn't like Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook is what Kobe Bryant would have been without Shaq / Gasol / Bynum.
Lol Russell Westbrook? Playoff Bust. Paul George? Excellent playoff success
Russell Westbrook has missed a ton of shots in the last 4 seasons
Russell Westbrook also has 0 rings  /thread
Russell Westbrook is making $40 million for another 4 years.  That's the main problem.
"That's weird, I love DJ Augustin and hate Russell Westbrook.  How about that."
"At one point in the night, sources said, Butler turned to teammate Russell Westbrook and screamed, ""Tootsies (bleeping) need me. These hoes can't win without me."" Butler left strippers and bouncers largely speechless. He dominated the club in every way. Jimmy's back"
Russell Westbrook has been on the trade market for what?  Two days?    Presti and others are trying to work out a deal that'll benefit both teams.  This shit doesn't happen instantaneously.
You realize Russell Westbrook is literally second in VORP right? But go off on advanced numbers
Russell Westbrook next question
Lol name 15 players better than Russell Westbrook right now
"7th. Russ has the biggest heart you could ever ask for from your point guard. Fearless in the open court. When his jumper’s on, unstoppable. Puts in 110% effort every night regardless of the opponent. True franchise leader and locker room captain. Sets the tone every night for his team and has continually remained loyal to the Thunder even as the roster has gradually downgraded around him.   I love Russell Westbrook. The NBA needs guys like him who wear their hearts on their sleeves."
"Everything's media worthy these days. ""Sources confirm Russell Westbrook may or may not have multiple legs."""
That’s a strange way to spell Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook shoots 43% from the field and 30% from 3 with no special defensive attributes to make up for his mediocre offense  He's a classic stat-pad trap and players like him are the reason efficiency metrics exist
I'm dumb?    You seriously think the Rockets want Russell Westbrook on their team? How the fuck does a ball dominant PG who can't shoot fit with Harden and the rest of the team?
The Russell Westbrook injury in the playoffs was brutal. That team was so good.
"Mohamed Haji @MohamedHajiNBA  Detroit Pistons are interested in acquiring PG Russell Westbrook and the package that was said to be sent is Reggie Jackson, Tony Snell &amp; 2 first round draft picks (2021 top-5 protected and 2023 unprotected), per league sources #NBASummer"
"...and yet, Russell Westbrook sucks"
How many playoff series victories does Russell Westbrook have without KD by his side though?

The lone guy who fell out and it wasn't because of old age (being 35+)  was Dwight Howard.  Over this five year span the guys who moved into the top 10 to take those spots were guys who were guys like Harden and Curry who were young and still considered top 15 players at the time.  Russ is only 30, I'm more than willing to bet that he can maintain his play for another 3 years."
Paul George got more MVP votes than Russell Westbrook?

"MDA uses a ball handler to iso or run pick and roll to create offense every play. People seem to be ignoring that Russell Westbrook does exactly that and you want more than one guy on your team who can do that. I’m that sense, he fits the style of play perfectly. The Rockets could bet on Russ bring a better shooter off the catch than chucking off the dribble. Having him would make sense without changing the scheme. It gives you 48 minutes of creation at the guard position. We are being a little silly thinking a guard who constantly runs pick and roll and creates at a high level doesn’t fit."
"Man, what lmao  Lee (I had to google to see who you were even taking about ) and Waiters are not assets at ALL  So basically what you’re sayin is OKC gives up Russell Westbrook for Tyler Herro. You’re also saying Dalla trades Courtney Lee for Dragic straight up.  And almost 300 people co-signed this...  Yea. So I’ve noticed people like trades that make for exciting teams, as opposed to an actual fair logical trade. Russ in Miami is exciting , Dragic in Dallas the Slovenian connection is exciting . So bc of that no one looks at how uneven it is"
"Since Russell Westbrook joined the NBA, there have been four teams that have won a western conference championship. One of them was the Thunder. Russ has more WCF titles in the last decade than anyone but the Spurs and Warriors.  He's got the same as Dirk, and Dirk would definitely have deserved a super max."

So many posts saying ""triple double"" and ""but he's RUSSELL WESTBROOK!"". I don't really get how people can follow the nba even vaguely and not realise that a guy on a $42m contract who is 'only' worth $30m is a worse asset than a guy on a $5m contract who is worth $5m."

We are not gutting our team for 30 year old Russell Westbrook. Only of the young guys they could get would probably be Herro. Bam and Winslow off limits.
"I won’t be surprised if they get a good package. I just don’t think it would be worth it. Players have value beyond their on court value/contracts and for a team like Detroit, Russell Westbrook may very well be a good investment overall, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good basketball decision."
"You guys are insane if you think the Thunder are just going to give away Russell Westbrook for a couple young guys and a second rounder or two. I don’t care how bad you think his contract is, he’s still one of the best guys in the league. He’s not top 5, but he’s definitely in that next tier above the super elite players. Presti won’t trade him for pennies"
Dude was stupid as hell. He thought he was better than Russell Westbrook lmaoooo
The Wizards offer John Wall for Russell Westbrook
"&gt; Pistons get: Russell Westbrook, Andre Roberson, Patrick Patterson  &gt; Thunder get: Blake Griffin, Reggie Jackson  &gt; Why: This is a fun hypothetical. It would bring Griffin back to where he went to college and is beloved in Oklahoma, Jackson would return to the Thunder and the Pistons would get their best guard since Isaiah Thomas retired.  Shockingly, the misspelling of Isiah Thomas is actually the *most* redeeming part of this blurb"
"Body control is the biggest part of athleticism. And the synapses that fire and tell you when and how to do something.  Jerry Rice was never the fastest guy. Ever seen him get caught, though?  Doncic is athletic. He just isn't Russell Westbrook athletic. Or Giannis freaky."

I’m not being biased.    are you going to answer the question? Both KD and Russell Westbrook resigned with OKC after their first deals expired.

Would you rather everyone just sit patiently in their seats and not give a shit whether the team is winning or losing?"
#Ryan Anderson begins James Harden and Russell Westbrook.
Because Giannis is still very efficient in spite of his lack of a jumper.   Giannis was the 7th most efficient player in the league last season. He was more efficient than Steph Curry.  Russell Westbrook was the 10th most efficient player on his own team. He was less efficient than Raymond Felton.
"This is coming from a writer who was a big driver of the Russell Westbrook MVP bandwagon, where ""he's a rare superstar who's loyal to his team unlike that snake KD"" was the 2nd-biggest factor after the triple doubles. I could easily sportswriters getting a major hard-on for someone who played for USA and had a good regular season. ""He's a rare star who answered the call for his country"" kind of crap that has nothing to do with how good the player actually is."
"Now let's compare him to several other all-timers who don't seem to have anywhere near the same negative perception even though their efficiency was no better than Bryant's.  &amp;#x200B;  Larry Bird:  80 Bird: +.07%  81 Bird: -.07%  82 Bird: +1.8%  83 Bird: +3.0%  84 Bird: +0.9%  85 Bird: +4.2%  86 Bird: +3.6%  87 Bird: +7.4%  88 Bird: +7.0%  90 Bird: +0.9%  &amp;#x200B;  Now Bird does have two seasons with efficiency that is a clear step ahead of what Bryant ever managed, but he also didn't hit prime Kobe's usual level until his fourth season, and Bryant has a ton more seasons of good/very good efficiency.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Look at their scoring efficiency numbers during their superstar years.  &amp;#x200B;  TS% relative to league-average:  80 Bird: +.07%  &amp;#x200B;  81 Bird: -.07%  &amp;#x200B;  82 Bird: +1.8%  &amp;#x200B;  83 Bird: +3.0%  &amp;#x200B;  84 Bird: +0.9%  &amp;#x200B;  85 Bird: +4.2%  &amp;#x200B;  86 Bird: +3.6%  &amp;#x200B;  87 Bird: +7.4%  &amp;#x200B;  88 Bird: +7.0%  &amp;#x200B;  90 Bird: +0.9%  &amp;#x200B;  Average: +2.89%  &amp;#x200B;  01 Bryant: +3.4%  &amp;#x200B;  02 Bryant: +2.4%  &amp;#x200B;  03 Bryant: +3.1%  &amp;#x200B;  04 Bryant: +3.5%  &amp;#x200B;  05 Bryant: +3.3%  &amp;#x200B;  06 Bryant: +2.4%  &amp;#x200B;  07 Bryant: +3.9%  &amp;#x200B;  08 Bryant: +3.6%  &amp;#x200B;  09 Bryant: +1.6%  &amp;#x200B;  10 Bryant: +0.2%  &amp;#x200B;  Average: +2.74  &amp;#x200B;  That's right. Bryant the ""inefficient chucker"" was very barely less efficient despite a huge difference in volume.  &amp;#x200B;  Let's compare him to another superstar who has a far more valuable narrative/perfection despite the fact there is very little difference in their efficiency numbers.  &amp;#x200B;  Dwyane Wade:  2005: +3.1%  &amp;#x200B;  2006: +4.2%  &amp;#x200B;  2007: +4.2% (51 games played)  &amp;#x200B;  2008: +0.9%  &amp;#x200B;  2009: +2.9%  &amp;#x200B;  2010: +1.9%  &amp;#x200B;  2011: +3.9%  &amp;#x200B;  2012: +3.2%  &amp;#x200B;  2013: +3.5%  &amp;#x200B;  2014: +4.7% (54 games played)  &amp;#x200B;  2015: +0.0%  &amp;#x200B;  2016: -2.4%  &amp;#x200B;  2017: -4.4%  &amp;#x200B;  Again they look virtually equal. Wade has a very, very slight lead prime vs prime but the gap is extremely small and Bryant was scoring with more volume...yet the difference in perception is vast.   &amp;#x200B;  So...why? FG%? Even knowing that's a useless stat to measure scoring efficiency it ignores extra value of threes and doesn't include free-throws.  &amp;#x200B;  Now here's the guys he's consistently lumped in with.  &amp;#x200B;  Iverson:  97: -2.3%  &amp;#x200B;  98: +1.1%  &amp;#x200B;  99: -0.3%  &amp;#x200B;  00: -2.7%  &amp;#x200B;  01: +0.0%  &amp;#x200B;  02: -3.1%  &amp;#x200B;  03: -1.9%  &amp;#x200B;  04: -3.8%  &amp;#x200B;  05: +0.2%  &amp;#x200B;  06: +0.8%  &amp;#x200B;  07: -0.1%  &amp;#x200B;  08: +2.7%  &amp;#x200B;  09: -4.1%  &amp;#x200B;  Westbrook:  &amp;#x200B;  2009: -5.5  &amp;#x200B;  2010: -5.2  &amp;#x200B;  2011: -0.3  &amp;#x200B;  2012: +1.1  &amp;#x200B;  2013: -0.3  &amp;#x200B;  2014: +0.4  &amp;#x200B;  2015: +0.2  &amp;#x200B;  2016: +1.3  &amp;#x200B;  2017: +0.2  &amp;#x200B;  2018: -3.2  &amp;#x200B;  2019: -5.9  &amp;#x200B;  Russell Westbrook's scoring efficiency is actually similar to Allen Iverson's when comparing to league average TS%.  &amp;#x200B;  NBA Season	League Average TS%	RW Reg Season TS%	RW Regular Season TS% Diff	RW Playoff TS%	RW Playoff TS% Diff  '19	56.0	50.1	-5.9	46.6	-9.4  '18	55.6	52.4	-3.2	49.3	-6.3  '17	55.2	55.4	0.2	51.1	-4.1  '16	54.1	55.4	1.3	51.5	-2.6  '15	53.4	53.6	0.2		  '14	54.1	54.5	0.4	53.9	-0.2  '13	53.5	53.2	-0.3	50.9	-2.6  '12	52.7	53.8	1.1	50.6	-2.1  '11	54.1	53.8	-0.3	49.9	-4.2  Average	54.3	53.6	-0.7	50.5	-3.9  Iverson	League Average TS%	AI Reg Season TS%	AI Regular Season TS% Diff	AI Playoff TS%	AI Playoff TS% Diff  '08	54.0	56.7	2.7	50.2	-3.8  '07	54.1	54	-0.1	44.7	-9.4  '06	53.6	54.3	0.7		  '05	52.9	53.2	0.3	56.2	3.3  '04	51.6	47.8	-3.8		  '03	51.9	50	-1.9	49.9	-2.0  '02	52.0	48.9	-3.1	51.5	-0.5  '01	51.8	51.8	0.0	48	-3.8  '00	52.3	49.6	-2.7	47.2	-5.1  '99	51.1	50.8	-0.3	48.1	-3.0  Average	52.5	51.7	-0.8	49.5	-3.1  &amp;#x200B;  As you can see...Kobe was a far, far more efficient scorer than either of these guys yet he is far closer to guys like Iverson/Westbrook than Wade/Bird etc in terms of perception and narrative.

When you see Jimmy Butler ahead of Russell Westbrook   You know its shit
He got that reputation from playing alongside Shaq when he didn't have to do nearly as much on offense. Once he had his own team he was playing Russell Westbrook type of defense where he wasn't a liability but was mostly just waiting for a chance to get the ball back.

Would you say Russell Westbrook is elite at driving and finishing? (Simmons shot a higher FG% on drives than Westbrook)
Russell Westbrook about to go 10/27 next.
I didn't say racial slurs.  Three years in Philly a man flipped off Russell Westbrook in the home opener for Philly vs Okc. He cussed him out and flipped off never used racial terms. He was escorted out of the building.
This like aggressively heckling nba players. So if youcan get kicked out for flipping off Russell Westbrook this will also get you kicked out of game.  Kind of common sense.
Russell Westbrook about to go 27/27 next.
"Rose definitely doesn’t need to play significant minutes. These aren’t just normal players, these are the best of the best and they consistently play 35+ minutes a night in the playoffs.  There are 48*5 (240) minutes in a game. In the 2018-19 playoffs these were their mpg averages: Russell Westbrook 39.4 Steph Curry 38.5 James Harden 38.5 Kevin Durant 36.8 Giannis Antetokounmpo 34.3  That’s a total of 187.5 minutes. That leaves 52.5 minutes for Lebron and Rose to split. In the 2017-18 playoffs Lebron averaged 41.9 minutes a game. Take that away and all you need from Rose is 10.6 minutes a game"
"I mean, you gotta take Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook with you to spring Lebron"
Russell Westbrook is a motherfucking Houston Rocket.
"Think of how hyped these Chinese Houston Rocket fans were when they heard Russell Westbrook signed, and now the government just took that shit away from them"
He’s probably still pissed he has to GM a team that has Russell Westbrook lol.
"I'm really curious how good CP3 is going to be this year. The athleticism decline hit him hard this year, but he's got skills that should enable him to still be effective. If 2020 Westbrook is 2019 Westbrook or worse, I could see CP3 being better.   And Lowry, too, although again, small guard, declining athleticism. It's not obvious which way that's going to go with him being asked to carry a bigger load this season.   Maybe Kemba? It'll be interesting to see what he's like with better teammates. People excuse a lot of Westbrook's flaws over the past few years due to his teammates but I don't really hear Kemba getting the same benefit of the doubt. Beal is really really good, too, although he seemed kind of checked out on that Washington squad.   If Oladipo comes back strong, that's a possibility. Of course, he might not. Mitchell could make a leap this year, this is his age 23-year. I wouldn't give him credit for being better than Westbrook, but I won't be surprised if it happens. Fox is young and should be rapidly improving, so I could see him making a leap, too. Booker is young enough to still be improving, and, again, while not saying I think he's great I think he's better than his reputation.   How good is Mike Conley on a competitive team that cares? I feel like he continually gets under-valued in these discussions. If Ben Simmons learns to shoot (I doubt it!) he's clearly better than Westbrook. Does D'Angelo Russell have another gear now that he doesn't have to do everything himself - he's also young enough to still be improving. Does Lonzo's new shot form (clearly hugely improved, but will it translate into buckets?) and being on a team that's built to his skillset allow him to jump up a couple of levels?  Denver seems to think Jamal Murray is poised to take a leap.   Do I expect all of those players to be better than Westbrook? Absolutely the hell not. Do I expect *none* of them to be? Equally no.   But I expect *some* of Murray-Lonzo-Mitchel-Fox-D'Lo-Simmons to make a big leap - I just don't really know which ones. So if Russ doesn't show that last season was a fluke (and my bet is that he will, albeit he won't be anywhere close to 2016-level Russ) it's easy to imagine some of them passing him."
&gt; probably in a bad mood after the game.   This is Russell Westbrook we're talking about here. There's no doubt that he's in a bad mood following a loss lol
"The intentions seem to be excellent between Russell Westbrook and James Harden. That's a good thing already.  Then we will have to see on the field how Russell Westbrook will accept that the Rockets are James Harden's team and not his.

That Aron Baynes' name? Russell Westbrook.
Fact: Russell Westbrook has never played under an above average coach in his NBA career.     Does he have weaknesses? Absolutely.      Did his coaches ever do anything to minimize them? Not in the slightest.     Excited to see what a top 10 coach like D’Antoni can do with him.
I dont know if russell westbrook is really soft spoken...
"In 2019 russ just sucked  This is exactly what he’s saying, you people will blame anyone but Russell Westbrook  You’ll bring up PG’s awful elimination game from 2018 but completely ignore russell westbrook missing more shots than the rest of his team combined in game five"
"Curry, Harden, LeBron, KD (He can play on tore Achilles), Embiid (I'll force him to represent USA).  **Bench:** Kawhi, Kyrie, AD, Jokic (Will be forced or I will get him suspended from the NBA), Giannis (Same as Jokic and Embiid), Russell Westbrook, Brad Beal"
"Perhaps Russell ""Agent Zero Fucks Given"" Westbrook?  Seriously though, nah, Russ deserves his own monikers not ones that are passed down second hand.  Plus No Chill Gil had a pretty sweet run way back when; I think he earned his honestly just like Jeremy Lin with Linsanity.  It didn't last as long as most of us would have liked, but it was actually pretty cool seeing this nearly-undrafted dude just lighting up teams, and while wearing one of the ugliest uniforms ever seen in the NBA.  Even before factoring in Arenas' contributions towards bringing safe firearms storage into the public consciousness, I find it hard to say a nickname was wasted on him, though Westbrook is far and away the superior player."
Yeah I think Danny is significantly better in a team defnese concept and help defense than he is on the ball at this stage. I think his defensive metrics might overstate him a hair on that end but I still think overall he's quite a net positive defender. It's just on ball 1 v1 that's not where he excels IMO.  Statistically in the past he's been one of hte best defending Russell Westbrook so I think bigger guards with size and physicality he can still handle. But yeah against quick 1s he has issues. And it is a concern for LAL i agree either Bradley or KCP needs to prove capable of playing 25ish min a night in the playoffs vs a team with a quicker guard.
Russell Westbrook and James Harden
"Samwell Tarly and Russell Westbrook, what a time to be alive"
"Yeah that 24 game statline is nutty. Basically a quarter of a season; that's a pretty solid sample size, and I wouldn't have put it past MJ to average that for the entire season as PG. Like a much better Russell Westbrook."
"Russell Westbrook was an extremely ball-dominant player and the ball was in his hands a lot.  Paul George and KD are not players who need to have the ball in their hands at all times.  James Harden in almost all of his possessions, and there were many, was content to just dribble out the clock and iso. The last two years Harden did not play off the ball in any way. When he was paired with CP3, CP3 wasn't creating easier looks for him or anything, they literally took turns iso-ing.  Russ isn't a great shooter, therefore is not a great iso-player. If you took the way that Westbrook played and the way that Harden played these past two years it literally looks incompatible. Now I don't think that will be the case, and I think that these two will both adapt their games because they're comfortable with each other and I have reason to believe that their offense will look very very different, but staring at Westbrook's inefficiencies and pairing that with Harden's iso-heavy approach to basketball, it is not wrong to think that it wouldn't mesh well together.  Westbrook's ""incompatibility"" isn't his production with other players, it is at crucial moments of the game where he tries to go hero-ball, forcing up bad shots or making bad passes, bad decisions all-around while your other best players are standing around or never even touching the ball."
He also has small feet for a guy that stands 6 foot 6 (size 13). In comparison Dwyane Wade who is 6 foot 5 and Russell Westbrook who is 6 foot 3 have a shoe size of 15.
"It's the Virtual 2017-2018 season. (In 2k17 franchise mode) The New York Knicks, lead by all star PG Russell Westbrook(who just had the most points and shots attempted in the league), JR Smith, Gordon Hayward, and rookie big man Notorious B.I.G(yes, I use create a player) are in the 2nd round of the Eastern conference 2k playoffs against the virtual Indiana Pacers. Leading the Pacers are Ben Simmons with a killer mid-range jumpshot(again, the game was made in 2016), Bradley Beal, and rookie big man Chuck Norris.   The game goes into double OT and is now pretty high scoring for a game with only 6 minute quarters. After falling behind in the 1st OT, Westbrook makes a layup and then drives and gets fouled, hitting two nerve wracking free throws to send the game to double OT. In the 2nd OT, Westbrook kicks out to 6th man Shane""sugar Shane"" Larkin, who calmly knocks down an open jumpshot to give the Knicks the lead, 99-97(I think, it was something like that). With about five seconds to play, the Pacers inbound the ball to OJ Mayo of all people, who is somehow good again in this game. Instead of driving to the hoop, Mayo pulls up from near halfcourt with JR Smith not far away from his face, but not really contesting the shot either. The ball goes in. Pacers win and move on, a controller gets thrown to the ground and I take a looong break from playing 2k.  True story, hope u liked that one"
Has James Harden and Russell Westbrook supplanted the Splash Brothers as the greatest back court of all time?
Russell “Le’veon Bell” Westbrook
"A phrase that starts with ""how"" and ends in a question mark is, in fact, a question. But you trying to insult my grammar for some reason is beside the point.  Here's a list of PGs he got cooked by in the playoffs: Chauncey Billups, Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Tony Parker, and Damian Lillard. All those guys are 6'3"" or under. Care to explain?  And Magic had the value of being able to switch onto a larger guard or forward, which CP3 obviously cannot."
Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were drafted by the Supersonics before the move to OKC was announced.
I can’t remember the last time I heard Westbrook and harden referred to as Russell and James
"Yeah, why would you use ""Russell"" (Common first name) and ""James"" (Common first and Last name) for something like this when you could do ""Westbrook"" (Not that common) and ""Harden"" (Unique).  I was like, ""When did Bill Russell and Lebron James play together?"""
We actually lost the other 4 because Kyrie was less efficient than Russell Westbrook and attempted to defend Giannis who is 9 inches taller than him.
Russell Westbrook is going to do a ton of glute exercises and end up being the best screener in the nba.
&gt;Russell Westbrook   &gt;   &gt;play great off the ball
You know the westbrook hate is at its peak when we're comparing john fricking wall to russell westbrook lamo.
"Scoring title is determined by a player's points per game, not total points.  James Harden (2014-15)   2217 points scored / 81 games played = 27.4 ppg  Russell Westbrook (2014-15)   1886 points scored / 67 games played = 28.1 ppg"
"Tenacious defender and rebounder. Great finisher at the rim. Russell Westbrook like energy. Underrated handle and court vision. Insane physical measurements. Is he LeBron? Hell naw, but nobody is. Is he an allstar? Yeah."
Russell Westbrook and James Harden.
Russell Westbrook.
Is having James Harden and Russell Westbrook supposed to be disappointing?
TIL Russell Westbrook is a middle aged Jew from Brooklyn

"&gt;Around the time of the draft, Russell Westbrook and George both communicated their discontent to the Thunder and expressed interest in the franchise possibly making significant changes, league sources told The Athletic. There had been frustration yet again at season’s end, with the Westbrook-George pairing falling short in the first round of the playoffs for a second time. It would only be natural that all options were considered.  &gt;Yet one rival team indicated to The Athletic that the Thunder were willing to discuss the prospect of trading Westbrook leading into the draft, with that revelation seen as a sign that they were considering changes even before George made his move.  https://theathletic.com/1086977/2019/07/23/inside-story-los-angeles-la-clippers-pursuit-of-kawhi-leonard-paul-george/  Lol Sam Presti playing yall like a fiddle. They were a tax team who had 2 straight first round exits and 2 more shoulder surgeries for PG. OKC were absolutely fine with this, and Presti comes out looking a lot better if he was forced to make a move rather than wanted to dismantle the team.  Don't see how anyone can believe Presti if Buha and Amick are correct in their reporting. This is saving face and people and eating this shit up"

"LeBron threads get gold so quick. Is LeBron himself just hanging out on r/nba/new all day?  Also, technically LeBron didn't lead the 2017 playofs in ppg. Russell Westbrook averaged 37.4 ppg... but in 5 games. What is the cutoff for games played to qualify for ppg leader in the playoffs? Genuine question, I don't know what I would consider. 2 rounds? 10 games? Finals players only?"
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/sports/russell-westbrook-utah-fan.amp.html I'm guessing that's the guy you are talking about. Shane Keisel.

I'm not defending the asshole fans in Utah, they are a minority of the fan base but they exist. I'm saying that it's a mistake to pretend it's a 'Utah problem' and not an NBA problem or a national problem in general. And Keisels a piece of shit but if you look at the comments Chinese NBA fans were making on Mitchell's Instagram earlier this month I'd say he has some competition for ""worst sports fan out of everywhere"""
Russell Westbrook. He’s gonna have a bounce back year and prove a lot of people wrong this year. Bet it.
"I mean, philly kind of did just that and idk how they did. Idk i think suns going for someone that will help then now will be better than getting someone that will help them in their peak, you've convinced me. Getting a top 15 pg, better than one of Curry, Westbrook, Harden, Paul, Lebron, Kemba, Kyrie, Kyle Lowry, Brogdon, Dame, Simmons,D'angelo Russell, De'Aaron Fox, Mike Conley and Jamal Murray. Youre right. My bad. Sorry for being such a nephew  Edit: I know you said ""last year"", but that doesnt really matter now or in the future does it"
"2012 team is way better than the 2008 team tbh. Thats who should be compared to the dream team or the 96 team.  PG - Chris Paul, Deron Williams,  Russell Westbrook  SG- Kobe Bryant, James Harden  SF- Lebron, Kevin Durant, Carmelo, Iguodala  Bigs- Kevin Love, Anthony Davis, Tyson Chandler"
Russell WestBROOK has made the playoffs every season aside from his rookie year.
"You really think Russell Westbrook and Paul George were ever going to go deep in the playoffs? Two season, two convincing first round exits."
Well Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double at age 28 but we ain’t here singing his praises are we??
"It’s not PGs fault Adams got egregiously overpaid   Also, again, something something Russell Westbrook."
"I mean, that team had Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden, widely regarded by most Thai prisoners to be the 3 most likeable players in the league."
"&gt;How is he ""below average""? Yeah he's at best an inconsistent shooter from deep but he's very good to elite at every other skill you want from a point guard.  You just described a version of Russell Westbrook that plays All-NBA defense, not Ricky Rubio."
"&gt; Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka will make up the core of the Thunder for perhaps the next decade. The Thunder will be perennial championship contenders for years to come."
Happy Russell Westbrook day now and forever
"Would you rather have Russell Westbrook or SGA, 7 firsts, and 4 swaps?  That's the difference between PG leaving last year and PG leaving now."
"Do you understand that just because the trades *happened* in that order doesn't mean they didn't *ask* for trades when there is evidence to contrary, correct?  https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/12/russell-westbrook-reportedly-wanted-a-trade-before-paul-george/  https://thunderousintentions.com/2019/07/20/okc-thunder-russell-wesrbrook-trade/2/  &gt;The surprising twist in all of this was the new tidbit that Russell Westbrook was the initial star the OKC Thunder looked to move to the Clippers.

There’s only one problem with this logic and it’s that Russell Westbrook is not another James Harden..
"Everyone handled this situation professionally. Neither Paul George nor Russell Westbrook drew any negative attention to the situation, and OKCs FO sent both players to teams of their choice AND got a great haul in return.   OKC's FO seemed ready to hit the reset button ultimately and Russell Westbrook and Paul George didn't have any objections."
"&gt;You gave me no reason for why the one I already linked isn't legit other than your own feelings.  Or, because the source is fucking Bleacher Report lol.  &gt;This was also reported as part of the recent big story on how the Kawhi/PG trade happened for the Clippers  Except not:  [[Lewenberg] A Raptors-Thunder deal was never close, per sources. The teams had preliminary talks regarding Paul George (who Kawhi had asked Toronto to get), but they were brief and never got off the runway. **They didn’t include Russell Westbrook**.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cbgx87/_/)  And even if Russ was on the table, the OKC-Toronto talks didn't start until PG requested a trade.   If you trust USA Today and BR for your NBA news then that's fine. I'd just rather trust reputable reporters like Lewenberg than your shit."
"I’ve yet to see a good argument for how it’s bad.  You know what all this trade and free agency drama brought?  The new official era of the NBA Power Couple.  The Lakers, Clippers, Rockets, Blazers, Nuggets and Jazz all have a legitimate shot at the 1-seed in the West this year, and the Warriors still exist too.  There are seven teams in this conference that you could argue have a shot at the Finals right now.  The East might realistically be a two-team race between Milwaukee and Philadelphia, but seven of the nine teams I’ve just named could win and give us the eighth unique champion the NBA’s seen in the last ten years.  And then next year the Nets get Kyrie and KD together.  This might be the most wide open season the league has seen in like 50 years.  For competitive balance, this offseason was pretty much a godsend.  Plus, even the teams that aren’t Finals contenders are in a decent spot.  You mean to tell me the Thunder, Pelicans, and Grizzlies aren’t in an excellent spot to build up their teams over the next four years?  There’s maybe one team that looks like it’s stuck in hell, and it’s Charlotte.  Phoenix still at least has Devin Booker to score 50 points in their 125-108 losses this year.  And we haven’t even talked about financials yet.  The NBA now gets to sell new jerseys for Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Kemba Walker, Jimmy Butler and “best rookie shoe deal ever” Zion Williamson. You think Nike and the NBA aren’t rock hard thinking about this year’s jersey sales?  You think no one’s noticed that the NBA just dominated the month of July?  You think ESPN isn’t going to run “Battle for LA” shit for a solid year?    So I mean yeah, I guess it does suck for New Orleans that they couldn’t keep Anthony Davis, but I guess that’s a cautionary tale about not running your basketball team in your off-time from running your football team?  You’ll note that the second Gayle Benson started treating that team like it mattered instead of Tom treating it like something to do when there was no football on, the Pelicans hired smart executives and made good moves.  They actually have their own medical staff now instead of just using an NFL staff, so maybe treatment of injuries will consist of more than “take some Toradol and get out there, pussy.”    And sure, it sucks for OKC that Paul George forced his way out, but you’ll excuse my lack of sympathy for a hard-bitten small-market team that only exists cause the NBA snaked Seattle and was stuck in first-round exit hell because when they had three (3!) future NBA MVPs on their team, they blew it up to save a fucking oil magnate a couple mil."
"Nice. May aswell sign Vince Carter and fucking Bill Russell next. Westbrook is washed, last season's shooting splits were historically bad. Dame is a level above now."
"Wilt's speed was chronicled in a reddit post last year:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6stnfm/collection_of_wilt_chamberlain_speed_stories/  Wilt was a legit track star at 300 lbs.  I don't know if he has the same initial burst as Russell Westbrook, but as stated, he beat Hal Greer, the fastest guard in the league at the time, in a 1/2 court race, even though Wilt was more of a long distance runner."
Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant
"I always thought it was fitting that it was Russell Westbrook whole finally also averaged a triple double. While Russ isn’t on Oscar’s level, they were both personally unpleasant athletic marvels that demanded perfection from their teammates and history will only be more and more unkind to them with time as people think of ways to downgrade their achievements because they were assholes who didn’t win as the best player on their team."
"I just looked him up last night! I was curious if anyone had ever averaged a triple double for their career, so I looked it up.  Nobody averages a triple double for their career, but Oscar and Russell Westbrook are the only two players to ever average a triple double in a season.  Oscar achieved this once, but came painfully close 4 other times (making up his first 5 seasons in the league). He should absolutely be in the GOAT discussions!  Full career stats... https://imgur.com/gallery/afzN2ch"
"Part of what happened is.   Oscar didn't follow through with his fantastic start, by winning multiple championships.    If we are going to compare him to Jordan, it would be like Mike hadt the first six years of his career, where he was so statistically dominant, then instead of breaking through and winning titles, the next six years were exactly the same.   Tremendous regular seasons, but falling in the playoffs to better teams.   Then in Jordans last couple years he gets traded to Orlando or Houston or San Antonio and  finally wins a title in his twilight years alongside a Hall of Fame center.   Keep Jordans regular season stats the same, but he doesn't go to the finals until he's traded.  He wouldn't be the GOAT.   He would be this amazing basketball player who, just wasn't big enough to dominate.   There would be talk of Jordan being the greatest off guard of all time, and the greatest scorer since Chamberlain, but that's it.    What Jordan did actually hurt Robertson's legacy.  Until Jordan, teams just didn't win championships with a backcourt guy.  You always needed a solid or even great center.  Jordan (and to a lesser extent Isiah Thomas.) moved that bar.  Robertson's legacy took a big hit with Magic becoming the consensus greatest point guard, with Jordan showing a high scoring guard could win titles, and finally the last few years when Russell Westbrook has taken away the mystique of the season long triple double.     I still have Oscar in my top ten.   But it's somewhere in the 8, 9 or 10 area."
"To be fair, everyone can see Westbrook play, they have context for how he plays, and how his team fairs in general. He achieved something spectacular statistically, a lot of people see how hard he plays and how much he gives to the game, but they also see how boneheaded he can be at times as well.   Oscar had the same mystique as Wilt and Bill Russell because most of us never seen them play. But someone in the modern era just averaged 3 triple double seasons in a row. It's absolutely amazing, but that mystique ain't there anymore for Oscar and for triple doubles in general."
"MJ is the GOAT   everyone else is just competing for GOTE (greatest of their era)   Oscar has just been overshadowed by better players at his position ... Magic with his records ... Stockton has some unbreakable records   if we rank Oscar at the top because of his triple doubles, then does Russell Westbrook get put above him?"
"&gt; Oscar averaged a triple double, but Russ just did that 3 times in a row.  Imagine if Russell Westbrook were the most efficient scorer in the league. That's basically Oscar Robertson's peak: he averaged 30/10/11 over his first five seasons while leading the league in TS%.  From 1961 to 1965, Oscar Robertson was [2nd in the league in points](http://bkref.com/tiny/xHXeN) (behind Wilt, of course), [10th in rebounds](http://bkref.com/tiny/dFvpu), and [1st in assists](http://bkref.com/tiny/DlrGa).

Robertson didn't just average a triple double over those 5 seasons, he also [led the NBA in TS%](http://bkref.com/tiny/MS3pL) over that stretch.

"&gt;In my opinion, I think some aspects of his game has to change and in other area's if he can improve in certain skills the Rockets are going to be a lot more of a threat than people are giving them credit for.    &gt;   &gt;Virtually most of last year's rotation is returning, all your doing is switching out CP3 for Westbrook. For this team to be successful one thing I feel needs to change is the amount of time Westbrook has control of the ball which shouldn't be an issue being that Harden can be a trusted counterpart in the back court now handling the ball. Especially down the stretch of games Harden can alleviate Westbrook and be the closer when finishing games.    &gt;   &gt;In the past we have known Westbrook not to be the best closer coming down the stretch. Mostly I feel Westbrooks penetration will open things up even more for Harden and Hardens perimeter game will open things up more for Westbrook. This may actually be a perfect match, both players are former MVP's.    &gt;   &gt;Both are just about age 30 still well in their prime and both haven't been plagued with injury throughout their careers. We all know that nobody can keep Russell Westbrook from getting to the rim. Can he consistently knock down a jumper though? This is the most important area that he needs to improve in, if he can the Rockets may be hoisting an NBA trophy very soon.    &gt;   &gt;Ultimately Westbrook can remain who he is in Houston with less ball handling responsibility, better shooting and down the stretch decision making and understanding the tempo in certain situations and adjusting.    &gt;   &gt;Most people think he may continue to focus on his individual stats, I feel him leaving OKC is a perfect opportunity to redefine who he is as a player with a fresh start in Houston. Russell Westbrook should be more willing to sacrifice self-accolades to compete for a championship with the opportunity he has in front of him."

"Maybe he can recruit another star like Russell Westbrook to ask for a trade and join him on a team with a lot of assets to trade, like Oklahoma City or something"
"It’s funny cos if you think about it, Russell Westbrook helped bring Steven Adams to the 6th highest field goal percentage in the league last year which is absolutely great.  But then CP3 brought deandre Jordan to the highest fg% in league history at 67%. Last year cp3 alongside harden got capella to 2nd in the leagu  Adams has that to look forward to"
"The Ring debate is only undervalued nowadays because Lebron doesn't have as many rings as Kobe, Duncan, Magic, or Kareem. It's a very very important factor to consider in all time rankings. The point of the game is to win not to get triple doubles or shoot 50/40/90 or anything else.      Tim Duncan, over his career, is 19/10/3 with 2 blocks per game on 57% TS, the exact same as Kobe who people mistakenly call inefficient. Those aren't bad numbers but they aren't top 10 player of all time numbers. He's considered top 10 because of stuff that doesn't show up in the stat sheet like his GOAT level interior defense, for which there is no satisfactory stat, and because his defense and reliability and selflessness led to 5 championships and 25 million 50 win years. Inversely, Russell Westbrook just averaged a triple double three straight years and he is barely a top 10 player in the league.      The ""better stats"" argument is just as bad as the ""more rings"" argument. Context always matters. This is why I hate ranking players 1 by 1. It's much better to do it on a tier system in my opinion. MJ is the only GOAT level player for me but after him there's the ""Best of Era"" tier. Duncan, Shaq, Lebron, Kobe, Magic, Bird all belong on that same tier."

Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook and De'Aaron Fox are the standards for “fast” point-guards.
"Though that act alone didn’t eliminate the Lakers — Leonard still met and communicated with them before his decision — Johnson’s leakage certainly didn’t help his former employer’s pitch.  On a fundamental level, the idea of forming a Big Three with James and Davis didn’t appeal to Leonard’s core sensibilities. He forged his legacy taking down super teams — like the 2014 Miami Heat and the 2019 Golden State Warriors — rather than joining them.  “Elite players like Kawhi earn their stripes, and he was not going to be a guy who joins a so-called ‘super team,’” one source close to the situation told Charania. “Now, if a super team forms around him, there is nothing he can control. The Clippers were the best long-term fit.”  As the NBA rumor mill rampantly churned, with multiple league insiders and media personalities placing the Clippers a distant third in the Leonard sweepstakes, the Clippers never felt compelled to respond or alter the public narrative.  Instead, they doubled down on their silence, ghosting the media and going off the grid. They were fine sitting back and obeying Leonard’s wishes, letting the media speculate and provide information from his meetings with the Lakers and the Raptors.  Honoring Leonard’s request was the easy part. Finding him a co-star proved more complex.  On that day that forever changed a once-laughable franchise, the front office was in a familiar, and temporary, station that had been its work home since May 1: Rented corporate space in El Segundo, about a quarter-mile from the Lakers’ headquarters, because, well, upgrades and renovations at the Playa Vista practice facility were causing a bit of dust.  This was the place where they executed their offseason playbook, where long days and short nights became the norm for this front office that might be the deepest and most talented in the league.  In the days leading up to Leonard’s decision, their core group — Frank, general manager Michael Winger, assistant general managers Mark Hughes and Trent Redden, and executive director of research and identity Lee Jenkins — had barely slept.  That included a 48-hour period in which the front office strategized seemingly every avenue possible to improve its roster around Leonard. On the final few nights before his announcement, the group would call it quits in the office around 2 a.m., then be back before 7 a.m.  But considering all that was at stake, the wheels would keep turning when the group headed home. Good luck reaching an REM state with this kind of opportunity in the balance.  As the Clippers surveyed the NBA scene, it wasn’t yet clear whom they could pair with the 2019 Finals MVP. They analyzed and studied every roster and star player in the league, attempting to find out who would best fit alongside Leonard, both on the hardwood and from a personality standpoint.  The Clippers inquired about Washington’s Bradley Beal and Houston’s James Harden, according to league sources, but neither star was available.  As *The Athletic* [previously reported](https://theathletic.com/1049513/2019/06/27/nba-free-agency-mysteries-from-kawhi-to-kd-on-down-clues-emerge/), Leonard had an interest in joining forces with Jimmy Butler on the Clippers and, according to ESPN, also reached out to Kevin Durant about teaming up in Los Angeles.  Enter Paul George.  Around the time of the draft, Russell Westbrook and George both communicated their discontent to the Thunder and expressed interest in the franchise possibly making significant changes, league sources told *The Athletic*. There had been frustration yet again at season’s end, with the Westbrook-George pairing falling short in the first round of the playoffs for a second time. It would only be natural that all options were considered.  The Thunder worked on quelling their duo’s concerns over the subsequent days and thought matters had been resolved — if only temporarily — by the start of free agency on June 30.  Oklahoma City moved forward with Westbrook and George as the foundation of its roster, and its free-agency pursuits — the agreement/non-agreement of Alec Burks and the addition of Mike Muscala — appeared to be evidence that it was adding to a playoff-level core. (After the Thunder sent George to the Clippers, they granted Burks’ wishes and [let him sign with Golden State](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/12/alec-burks-details-how-paul-george-trade-led-to-warriors-signing/).)  But on July 3, the Clippers received word that George wanted out of Oklahoma City and Leonard had been recruiting George to ask for a trade to team up with him and the Clippers. There are conflicting accounts on Leonard’s involvement in recruiting George. For the record, it should be stated that a source told Charania that it is “not accurate” that Leonard recruited George to demand a trade and come to the Clippers.  George sensed this was a special opportunity to head back home to Southern California, collaborate with one of the game’s best players in Leonard, contend for championships and join a like-minded organization in the Clippers. His endorsement was crucial — and, after talking with Leonard, he was on board."
I geel like miami has come through with crazy xo fidence on all the trades since jimmy. With westbrook there was russell eastbrook was foregone conclusion even before that list of destinations came out

"Russell Westbrook is a generational athlete,  Terry is not. Completely remove rebounding too. The one aspect of their game that is somewhat similar (I’m pulling straws here) is probably Defense."
"Basically take Russell Westbrook, significantly reduce his upside, significantly increase his downside and more or less completely remove assists from his game, and that's Terry Rozier. I'll let you all decide if that's worth $20 mil/year."

"Yeah I think only young people who haven't watched more than a generation think some players are guaranteed to stay just because they express feeling that way in their prime. Wade left. Hakeem left. Malone left. This season we saw an unforeseeable situation that lead to Russell Westbrook leaving, and yet still people think ""but there's no way *my* favorite player leaves..."""
"Here are a few pretty serious ones:  -	a top player coming out as gay -	a team going back to Seattle -	a team coming back from a 3-0 deficit in the finals -	a full court buzzer beating game winner   -	a top star retiring suddenly (like Magic Johnson did) -	a top star passing away unexpectedly -	a top player becoming US President -	some sort of official confirmation that the NBA has overtaken the NFL as top American sport -	if the Cavs overcame the 3-1 deficit today, I think it would be the top post in subreddit history -	a top NBA star directly addressing r/nba (could be an AMA, video post, etc) -	James Dolan sells the Knicks -	a well-known franchise relocates or folds  -	LeBron winning his 6th or 7th ring -	MJ publicly declares LeBron to be the GOAT (I think it would have the most upvotes, but also have the most downvotes, too) -	KD publicly apologizes to Russell Westbrook and OKC -	the FBI/NBA confirms whether the 2002 WCF was rigged or not"
The joke is if you honestly feel that Stockton is greater than Thomas who is greater than Duncan who is greater than Russell who is greater than Wilt.  No Westbrook is not greater than any of them... *maybe* Stockton/IT is the most one could argue in his case... Harden would definitely be better than either of them already (with simply one ring added to his career).
"Remove "", Paul, And Russell Westbrook"" then i can relate"
"&gt; Yeah, you’re missing that I never said the extras had top priority. Just an excercise to maximize his power even beyond that of his peers. The Clippers can still say no and have the best offer available to Leonard’s camp  So what you’re saying is at the end of the day Kawhi went with the team that he felt fit him best, regardless of the “break the CBA” demands  &gt; All we do know is that the Raptors felt the demands made to them were unreasonable and the Lakers felt they were not being taken seriously as a suitor  I always took the “unreasonable demands” he made to the raptors as the rumoured trade for Paul George and Russell Westbrook."
"Interesting coincidences:  The Nets currently have 3 Team USA 2016 players.  The Warriors had 3 Team USA 2016 players, maxed out at 5, had 6 at one time or another, and are down to 2.  All the best Raptors players in 2016 all played for team USA.  Nobody on Team USA 2016 has won an MVP since 2014. Nobody besides Kevin Durant has won an MVP, period. Notice that LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook all sat this Olympics out."
"Sounds like you’re referencing the fiba roster. He says China, referencing the olympics. But in 2016 Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James harden, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Gordon Hayward, Andre Drummond, and Damian Lillard all withdrew, so maybe we see something similar next summer."
No but that's what it takes to win. You have to be so competitive that you push yourself past your limits in order to defeat someone who wants to win as badly as you do because you have to push yourself further than your opponent to gain an advantage.  You think MJ's personality was healthy? He was a psychopath about winning. Remember Kobe's personality? He was always miserable never happy he was only happy after he won. Look at Chris Paul's personality. Draymond Green. Kevin Garnett.  Russell Westbrook. Kevin Durant said he didn't sleep before finals games in 2017. You think that's healthy?  Lebron in Miami was quite simply obsessed with winning that he could have been diagnosed with a mental health condition. Pat Riley told the Lakers they would never be happy while winning only afterwards.
Bill Russell Westbrook
Southwest has got to be Rockets. Harden is hitler on this sub and they just added Russell “stat pad” Westbrook.
1. Magic Johnson  2. Steve Nash  3. Chris Paul  4. John Stockton  5. Lebron James  6. Michael Jordan  7. Russell Westbrook  8. Larry Bird  9. Deron Williams  10. Kevin Johnson
"""Ahem excuseeeeeee me, but I feel like I must interject with my WELL-RESEARCHED, and very un-petty Westbrook hate. No fun will be had at Russell Westbrook this evening!"""
"So NBA champion Jason Kidd wasn't good enough of a post-season scorer to make the list, but Russell Westbrook, who's scoring efficiency crashes and burns in the playoffs is #7."
they definitely aren't *much* bigger  |PLAYER|HEIGHTW/OSHOES| :--|:--| |Russell Westbrook|6' 2.25''| |James Harden|6' 4''| ||| |Stephen Curry|6' 2''| |D?Angelo Russell|6' 3.25''|
It says [here](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15628762/everything-always-wanted-know-russell-westbrook-were-afraid-ask) that he received a partial academic scholarship
1- Mike Conley   2- Russell Westbrook   3- Kemba Walker   4- Kawhi   5- Kyrie / PG13
Russell Westbrook got a scholarship from Stanford based on **academics** and you can see his BBIQ.
"Yeah, of course, I’m specifically talking about what Russell offers in terms of fit.  D’Antoni wants a team that plays at a high pace, and Morey wants to put pressure on the rim and create open 3’s. Westbrook is elite at all of those things. His shot selection is poor, and will be a frustration, but he’s gonna be huge for Houston this year."
"That’s fun.  Did you watch the interview? That was a grown man pulling the act of a toddler. “The nba doesn’t love me like I now love them.” Oh so now he loves the nba.  The narrative around his name is he’s a shitty volume shooter who makes every team he’s on worse. You laugh at Lin having a ring, something I never brought up, but how many nba championships does Carmelo have?  Have many nba finals has Carmelo been to?  Aside from beating Steve Blake and the university of Maryland before high school kids had to go to college for one year what has he ever accomplished? I significantly less successful career than Russell Westbrook?  Made the conference finals once in the west and was roundly embarrassed by an extremely weak eastern conference multiple times. Very impressive"
So Less than Russell Westbrook without ever making the finals?
Ja Morant -&gt; Dennis Smith JR -&gt; Russell Westbrook
He did it on Russell Westbrook efficiency. He contributes nothing. If I wanted a low efficiency volume scorer who can’t crack 20 points I’d call Marcus Morris and ask him to not play defense
"Well yeah... AD shouldn't have requested a trade mid-season and he shouldn't have made it public.  Lebron didn't get ""stabbed in the back"", Griffin literally just said he didn't enjoy the job.  Melo IS washed up.  Rockets did lie to CP3, that's true. To be fair though, Russell Westbrook wasn't available when they told him that."
Russell Westbrook says hi
"Regardless of whether Melo should be cut I really think Morey's reputation with players is going to be hurt from this interview. People are going to realize they courted &amp; tossed Melo, courted &amp; tossed Chris Paul and if things don't work with Russell Westbrook are they going to get another big name?  (Also Dwight but, eh)"
"Ah yes, Russell Westbrook, a guy who puts insane amounts of pressure on the rim, plays at a high pace, and creates the most open 3’s in the NBA, is the same as current Carmelo Anthony, this makes a lot of sense"
"&gt; 9th or 10th man in a rotation  Let's be real. D'Antoni barely acknowledges that he has more than 7 players on his roster. The 8th, 9th, and 10th men in his rotation will be James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden again."
"let’s be honest with ourselves for a minute.  we gotta stop playing with this mans fucking name. we are talking about RUSSELL WESTBROOK.  Not some scrub. One of the best scorers in the game and he’s still a bucket. Easily one of the most misunderstood players in NBA history, and clearly often used as a scapegoat for a lot of bad basketball that simply isn’t his fault."
That was them. Not me. I never get the hype people say about cp3 even back when he was still in Lob City. He's never been a go to guy unlike Russell Westbrook.
Not when you shoot like shit lol. That's the Russell Westbrook special and look how it's gone for him
Russell Westbrook triple double to win game 7 of the finals
Imagine if Russell Westbrook and James Harden had to experience that on 2 different franchises.
Steph Curry/Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard/Kyrie Irving don’t just grow on trees.
Ah yes.  Russell Westbrook.
"Paul George shot 39% on ten attempts per game. That's downright elite.   Jerami Grant shot 39% on four attempts per game. That's absolutely better than ""decent.""  TFerg sucks, but even he was an above league average threat from deep.   The Westbrook had no spacing narrative isn't really rooted in anything factual. In fact, Grant and George were better shooters last year than the likes of Gordon or Rivers or even Tucker.   But again. Somewhere along the lines this off-season facts stopped being important when talking about Russell Westbrook, and the last two seasons of data were ignored."
"Russell ""Imma be a better shooter next season"" Westbrook is shooting 24.1% from 3, that's worst than last season which was worse than the season before which was also worse than the season before that."
"Russell Westbrook was -46 for his +/-.  I know it's early, and these games may be argued as meaningless.  And he is adjusting to a new team.  But will he make his teammates better?   I hope so because if not, he could be traded to the Heat."
"[Did we all jump the gun on James Harden and Russell Westbrook? Great at drawing free throws and getting triple doubles but man, this isn’t looking good for them. Can they lead a team? This year might expose a lot.](https://twitter.com/MarkAGunnels/status/1188563371152396289)"
2. Kevin Durant.      3. Steph Curry.     4. James Harden.      5. Russell Westbrook
"I think Russell and Green are pretty much better than everybody on that 17 Thunder roster, minus Westbrook of course"
vs Devin Booker vs Donovan Mitchell vs 5'9 Shaq vs Trae Young vs Russell Westbrook vs Prime Shaq in sandals in a steel cage
"No I'm just picking people who are. Yes he's good. I'm talking about great.  And regardless of that, pick someone else. Harping on my choice of Kawhi because I don't think he is visibly dominant is immaterial to the point that the eye test and the analytics go hand in hand to separate those who you have trouble distinguishing apart.  Who's better... Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook? Lebron or KD? Steph or Klay?  Eye tests and stats are two different metrics that we use in tandem to argue points."
When you watch the game and rely only on the eye test you would think that Kawhi Leonard was just a average player. He's not flashy and he doesn't do anything that you would find super exciting on a regular basis. But he puts up an amazing stat line every night. Sometimes the eye test is not enough validation for great players.  To the Counterpoint Russell Westbrook puts up a triple double on a regular basis and yet he would not be the number one point guard in the league. Sometimes stats don't say everything. But we use both stats and the eye test to create our points.
Not the point at all....put jokic there or kyrie or Paul George or Russell Westbrook. No one is gonna see a stat line of 9 and 24 while going 3 of 11 from three and say “man that’s a really fucking good player”.
Same guy who told Demar Derozan and Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
"Brooklyn's grey-ish court style combined with their grey jerseys made the Rockets really stand out on my tv. Looked like they were playing a black and white team like a scene out of *Pleasantville*.  I know that's a pretty random reference for r/nba but it's a good movie and if you've seen it, it's funny to imagine Russell Westbrook in the Tobey Maguire role."
"&gt; I know you're an absolute Brown/Tatum hater and have called Hayward's contract the worst in the league  Please show me where I've said Hayward's contract is the ""worst in the league"". I've never said that and don't think it is. Even if he played like total garbage or was barely playing this year I wouldn't think that simply because it expires after next season. Is he overpaid? Sure, but when I think of worst contracts in the league I don't even think about him, nor do I question why the Celtics maxed him to begin with. IMO the worst contract in the league is John Wall, closely followed by [Russell Westbrook.](https://i.imgur.com/RqH4iQW.png) Hayward could even be a decent trade chip next summer or season as a large expiring deal, especially if packaged with someone like Tatum if the Celtics go after a true superstar (James Harden maybe?).  I also don't ""hate"" Brown and Tatum, I just think they're wildly overrated by a lot of people. I think they've been coasting a lot on a good playoff run two years ago and haven't shown drastic improvement since, but for whatever reason people just ignore that. People talk about Tatum like he's a future MVP candidate but the guy has a TS% of .482 this year and a PER that's barely above league average at 16.8. Yes he's young but at some point we need to see some *improvement* out of the guy. At his age you're supposed to show steady signs of improvement, not stagnation and regression.  And Jaylen Brown is a quality role player/starter, but he too gets talked about like he's gonna be a multi-time All Star and I just don't see it. He's a 3&amp;D guy with good athleticism, but he has poor handles, can't run plays for other people and can't create his own shot. He needs to take major leaps forward, IMO, to really live up to the reputation he's got. If he doesn't then I just see him as the next Robert Covington: definitely a quality player and an important piece, but not a star (nor someone who should be making the kind of money he will be). Both he and Tatum *can* improve of course, but apparently I'm just one of the few people who's not willing to simply assume that'll happen. I want to see it first."
"In two years in Boston, he improved significantly on defense. He also basically, generally, ran the offense the way Brad wanted him to and in a change from what he did in Cleveland.   He was far from perfect, and like I said, he was central to a chemistry implosion and didn’t fit with the young guys. But yeah I’d call him coachable because he basically played like Brad told him to, which is the opposite of Russell Westbrook who has refused to do that, or Carmelo Anthony who refused to do that until OKC, or Allen Iverson or several other stars who were truly uncoachable."
I keep imagining a berserk Russell Westbrook dunking on everyone in this video
"Hmm. Bron, Kobe, kd, Chris Paul, Russell westbrook, Marc Gasol, Blake griffin, Dwight howard and then maybe Melo so I guess you’re right"
TBF though I thought Russell Westbrook wouldn't make sense in another jersey but here we are
Russell Westbrook.......but seriously Steven Adams would stay with the Thunder even if Presti kicked him in the nuts on the way in every morning.
So Russell Westbrook is a better playmaker then LeBron?
That's a Russell Westbrook answer
He's more Jason Kidd and less Russell Westbrook.

And that HOU  shooting percentage was with Russell Westbrook having a typically bad shooting night on 1/5 from 3pt and 7/16 overall.
He's pacing himself. Looks much faster in person. He can change died like damn I didn't know he was that fast. Sorta just hypnotizes you.   He's not Russell Westbrook. He can't turn on the Jets like even old kawhi can but he still really good
"Before you get upset, all of those references were to things he's done prior to 2016. Yeah Surge Ibaka was amazing, but Durant was the man on that team.  He was already a superstar prior to the development of Russell Westbrook, hence their turnaround in 2010."
"So the guards in contention would be: Lillard, Don Mitchell, Harden, Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan, Doncic, Chris Paul, D’Angelo Russell, Jrue Holliday, McCollum, Jamal Murray. Booker could definitely make it in this field. Especially if he’s putting up mid-20’s per game"

James harden and Russell Westbrook
"That was last year.  Lebron drafted Russ in 2018  &gt;[Westbrook smiled and laughed.](https://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/26/oklahoma-city-thunder-russell-westbrook-misunderstanding-nba-all-star-draft)   &gt;   &gt;""But I see I was the last pick on the list -- I was just trying to figure out how ..."" Westbrook said, referring to a [list tweeted out by James](https://twitter.com/uninterrupted/status/956679530533478401).   &gt;   &gt; ""I heard from Russ,"" James said after the Cavs' shootaround Friday morning. ""I reached out to him afterwards. like, 'What's wrong with you, man?' We've got a good relationship, so it's pretty cool."""

Russell Westbrook with a higher bbiq
Fox is still young. He’s an incredibly fast guard who can finish through contact. Based on his skills and talent his ceiling is legitimately Russell Westbrook. That’s just not going to happen under an awful developmental coach like Luke Walton.
[This guy](https://gossiponthis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/russell-westbrook-middle-finger-sixers-fan.jpg) is the president of his hater's club.
"[Your fans get banned for slurs in actual recent history](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/12/russell-westbrook-confronts-fan-racial-comment-utah-jazz-thunder-nba).  Quit acting like Philly is exclusive to trash. Everyone has garbage fans, your city is included."
"It’s not a decision being made because Steph curry can’t play that way. Russell Westbrook was legitimately the fastest NBA player in the league for 9 years until De’Aaron Fox showed up. He’s a 6’4 athletic freak who can touch the top of the backboard and got to practice finishing through guys like Steven Adams for years.   James Harden is 6’6, has insane body control, and has the #1 deceleration ability in the league which is why he’s able to get people off balance and in the air with his timing.   Steph is 6’2, and is so fragile his name brand shoes have [Forrest Gump braces](https://images.app.goo.gl/Yvd1SgTVa2zNs4pHA) built into them for his weak ankles.  It’s not a coaching decision. Steph legitimately can not play that band of basketball"
You’re wrong. He plays in an offense with Russell Westbrook.  4 games is a small sample size. As the season and offense progresses you’ll see much more balance between Westbrook and Harden
"Considering  Klay and Curry's injuries could open two backcourt spots for him, I think it's possible.   After Harden, Westbrook, Lillard, the rest of the spots are fair game. I'd take Booker/Luka/Mitchell before him but it's not a stretch to think Russell could get a spot, he'll certainly get the touches to do it."

"cool post! I've got a couple of my own  **The Suns are going to make the playoffs.**  They're physical, aggressive, and play hard. They're ranked 7th in defensive rating right now. The Suns!  Kelly Oubre and Jevon Carter ([who?](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/carteje01.html)) look like especially pesky defenders, and solid on offense too. They also play an active, motion-heavy offense full of constant screens and cuts that leave defending teams reeling. They beat the Clippers, who are supposed to be this season's favourites, and it wasn't because shots went their way--they straight-up outplayed them.  The Suns are making the playoffs in the crowded West, and my money is on Monty Williams winning coach of the year.  **Russell Westbrook is a perfect fit on the Rockets**  I was a lot higher on Westbrook working on the Rockets already, but oh man. He's already just about averaging a tripple double. He still [steals rebounds from Adams, apparently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox7mGs8DY1A).   What's especially noticeable is how well he thrives in space. Russell hits 5th gear almost instantly, shooting past defenders and causing chaos, which is something even his own team isn't ready for a lot of the time. He keeps making passes to Capella who isn't ready for them, and I'm looking forward to that chemistry improving. Westbrook can now drive-and-dish to players who can really shoot, on a team whose whole offense is designed to make the drive-and-dish effective. He's already taking advantage, but I expect his passes to connect more often learns the Rockets offense better.   Being able to rely on Harden for some of his possessions seems to be a game-changer as well. On the Thunder he was often fighting back exhaustion the past couple years, but now when he gets the ball he explodes. I suspect that late-season and into the playoffs, the reduced load will end up paying off for Harden as well.  The Rockets are sorely missing depth, and need better defenders. It's going to be interesting how they deal with having two ball-watchers in Harden and Westbrook on the floor at the same time. But this team is going to be a lot of fun to watch, and is going to be an offensive force."

russell and green.... who did westbrook have? in 2017?

Russell Westbrook though...
"Starting at Guard, 6’3″ from UCLA, number 0,     RUSSELL WESTBROOK"
"[He asked for a trade](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2845296-russell-westbrook-reportedly-talked-thunder-trade-after-2019-playoff-loss)  &gt;""Russell Westbrook initially approached the Oklahoma City Thunder about a possible trade following the team's first-round loss in the 2019 postseason, according to the Houston Chronicle's Jonathan Feigen.""  As for the fans wanting him out, it came out harsher than I intended. My point was the fans were all in acceptance that this team has gone as far as it could with PG13 and Westbrook. They were capped out and didnt really have any moves to make. When PG13 requested a trade it was the final nail in the coffin and I dont remember anyone objecting to the trade, the benefit to the franchise was obvious."
"Trade LeBron to OKC for draft picks, use draft picks to acquire Russell Westbrook from Houston."
"Because as near as we are able to tell, other guys helped their teams win more than Wilt did. Consider Russell Westbrook- insane stats, but at least the last couple years you could argue whether he really helped his team anywhere close to what his stats show. Wilt is obviously greater than Westbrook, but it's the same kind of thing."
"Yesterday was Dominique Wilkins, James Worthy, Lebron James, Manu Ginobili, Chris Bosh, Carmelo Anthony, Victor Oladipo, Marc Gasol, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Ralph Sampson, plus more."
"Russell Westbrook: ""When I poop, I have no friends. When I’m inside the bowl, there are no friends. Bounty, that’s my friend"""
The rest is a kinda cool quote that also makes him sound sorta selfish but this just makes the quote sound really stupid. That's a lot of people.  Since when does being somewhere with like 15+ friends (depending who all on the coaching staff counts) constitute not having friends out there? Every basketball game I've watched live I had less friends there than Russell Westbrook. That's just being dramatic now.

"Kings are being run (not terribly well) by Divac.  They've got Bogdanović and Bjelica.  Boban Marjanović is on Dallas.  There are a couple of other Serbian players but they're the main ones other than Jokic as you mentioned.    Your Timberwolves are ok, but not really considered to be a contender.  Karl-Anthony Towns is a great player and one of the best bigs in the NBA, but they're spending a small fortune on a guy named Andrew Wiggins, who turned out to be one of the most inefficient players in basketball.    The last 5 years of the NBA have been dominated by the Warriors, who launched a 3-point shooting revolution in the NBA.  Teams put an incredibly high value on 3-point shooting now and its considered normal for at least one of your PF/C to be a 3-point shooter, while your PG/SG/SF all better shoot 3s or else be reallly good at something else.  That Warriors team is coached by Steve Kerr and led by their elite shooting PG Steph Curry.  They went to 5 straight finals and won 3 of them.  In 2015-16 they won the most regular season wins of any team of all time, beating the Bulls record.  They were struck by injuries in the NBA Finals last season and are rebuilding this season, not expected to be a a major threat to win the Championship, but have an outside shot.  LeBron James dominated the Eastern Conference for years, first at Cleveland, then at Miami (where he won two rings), then back at Cleveland (where he won one against the Warriors).  His teams went to the finals 8 consecutive seasons.  At the beginning of last season, he signed with the Lakers.  With the addition of All Star PF/C Anthony Davis, the Lakers are considered a major title contender.    The Western Conference has generally been better than the East for 20 years now.  The Lakers had a ton of success with Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol between 2008-2010.  The Spurs are always good and Popovich is still their coach, but they probably missed out on seriously extending their dynasty when their All Star, Kawhi Leonard, forced his way off of the team due to disagreements over an injury.  They're still good, but not considered a serious title contender.    Kawhi Leonard forced the Spurs to trade him, so they sent him to Toronto.  Toronto won a championship that year against an injured Warriors team (that they might have beaten anyways, but we'll never no).  Kawhi was the Finals MVP and made a strong argument for being the best overall player in the league.  There was a major push by a couple teams to sign him, and he wound up with the Clippers, who are considered a title contender and the favorite (though not overwhelmingly).  With the Warriors dealing with injuries and departures, along with a bunch of major moves in the league, this season is considered to be pretty wide open with about 8 teams being viewed as title contenders.  There aren't really any superteams this season, but a bunch of duos among the top teams.  The contenders are the Clippers (Kawhi Leonard + Paul George), Lakers (LeBron James + Anthony Davis), Houston (James Harden + Russell Westbrook), Denver (Jokic + Jamal Murray), Utah (Mitchell + Bogdanovich), Portland (Damian Lillard + CJ McCollum), Philadelphia (Joel Embiid + Ben Simmons), and Milwaukee (Giannis Antetokounmpo + Khris Middleton).    The last major trend I'll mention is fouling.  Over the last several seasons drawing fouls has become an art form and a major part of the game.  Houston's James Harden, who is an incredible player, has gained a reputation for playing to get fouled and shoot free throws rather than actually trying to score a field goal.  He averaged almost 10 FTA/Game last season.  Its effective, but frustrating to watch."
"You're right. Klay's 24.7 PPG on 54.5 TS% helped the Warriors win that series more than Steph's 27.9 PPG on 61.2 TS%.   Kevin Durant showed just how dominant he was without Steph in that series, averaging 30.0 PPG on a very high 53.9 TS%. And Russell Westbrook of course proved himself better than Curry in that series with his 26.7 PPG on 50.9 TS%."
"It's clear you're right. But I hate it. He dunked, landed, smiled and shimmied. It's not like he got in his face he just landed, smiled in his direction and shimmied.   I wish the NBA would be more consistent with these calls. I would like them to come out and say this tech is rescinded and here's why. Or this tech stands and here's why. But Russell Westbrook (and many others) dunk and flex in the general direction of the defender all the time and never get a tech (and shouldn't). This is a bullshit call to me."

From there, became a huge fan of his, and wanted him to hit his Apex basically as a modern-day equivalent to Isiah Thomas and the ‘Bad Boy’ Pistons. Such a shame his career was ruined by injuries, influenced by biomechanics, and Thibs’ penchant for running players into the ground. Still root for him, though.

"And 32% is a capable shooter. You still need to respect him on the perimeter. You haven’t even taken into account shot selection which I’ll get into right now  Luka last year shot 34.7% on wide open 3s. Could be better, but you can’t leave him open. 2.6 of his 3 point attempts came wide open, meaning that defenders were within range of him on over 63% of his 3s.  Russell Westbrook shot 32.6% on wide open 3s - but that was for over 45% of his attempts. So defenders respected him much less than they did Luka.  Now how about a defender within contesting range?  With defenders from 4-6 feet away, Westbrook shot 26.9%. Disgustingly bad.  With defenders from 4-6 feet away, Luka shot 33.3%. Not bad at all, and this accounted for a good portion of his attempts.  Please tell me some more about how Luka is Westbrook level of a shooter"

So not Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook isn't on the team anymore
"I honestly don’t know exactly what Luka would have to do to surpass Dirk as GOAT in my book. Cuz Dirk didn’t just lead us to a ring, he fucking destroyed Kobe and the Lakers, then bested Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook (on the same fucking team!), then just went Disney Sports Movie on LeBron, Wade, and Bosh. Add his fucking fever game in that series and you got a hell of a mountain to climb if you wanna beat that. I’d say if Luka gets 2 rings for Dallas, he’d definitely be on par with Dirk imo."
Russell Westbrook is a Houston Rocket. Damn.
I think Dame is the opposite of a bum. I think hes better than Russell Westbrook.
"Russell Westbrook who has an MVP, been further than Lillard ever has, also is getting paid more by both his team and Jordan, currently has more wins, wishes he was Damian Lillard.  Ok"

"He'd be like Wilt Chamberlain, god damn you Russell Westbrook"
"Russell Westbrook could be 9/10 from three,  and I'll still bet that he'll miss the next three point shot"
"Russell Westbrook had by far the highest BPM ever because of the interaction between rebounds and assists. It’s a heavily flawed stat (but the best box score stat). On that note, win shares and PER are absolute bullshit. PIPM has been severely criticized by realgm stat people and anyone who understands statistics, and TPA is literally derived from BPM so you’re double counting. VORP is a minutes weighted BPM so that’s another double counting.   If you look at BPM, RAPM, PIPM, AuPM all together, it’s more accurate, but a lot of these stats haven’t been released yet or are relying on extremely small sample sizes. In short, the statistical argument for Giannis has merit (i.e. since he has higher stats from a Bayesian standpoint if not statistically Giannis is more likely to be better), but it’s not a “haha lmao” statement to think Harden is better for a variety of reasons."

The players he guards attempt eight field goals per game, per Synergy Sports, which means they take more than half of their shots without any sort of defensive effort on Westbrook’s part despite him being the closest defender. Even his attempts to contest shots does little good: Opponents have a better field goal percentage on shots he defends (48.6 percent) than on all of their other field goal attempts combined during the regular season (45.2 percent)."
"The most underrated thing about LeBron is his ability to control the way the game is played. You can't flip a switch and put him on the backfoot. One possession, he's Chris Paul, a slow and calculating floor general and the next, Russell Westbrook, a dynamic transition slasher."

It’s amazing that they continue to shit on Russell Westbrook for his rebounding without recognising it’s importance are now talking about the importance of non-bigs grabbing rebounds.
"James Harden averaged 45ppg on 46FG% 40 3pt% with 29FGA/g and 14FTA/g. He had a TS% of 63% - 8% above league average - and, since you hate free throws, he had an EFG% of 56% - 4% above league average.   Just the game before this one, (which was a back to back game without Eric Gordon, Clint Capela and Russell Westbrook) he had 44 points on 13-26 shooting, 6-14 from 3 point land and 12-14 FT."
Bill Russell Westbrook
"Basically helped him learn how to make sharp cuts and movements like he used to, but load up in his hips instead of his ankles. Breaking down movements and actions that caused him ankle issues repeatedly and figuring out ways to correct it.  Similar cases include Russell Westbrook and Aaron Gordon. They were both getting riddled with injuries and they both got biomechanical help on how to land when jumping, and it's been visibly notable on how fewer injuries they've sustained since."
Does that not also apply to Russell Westbrook? Considering he’s been their only elite playmaker his last 3 seasons in OKC?
What about Russell Westbrook?
"I couldn't understand how Harden had made up the 200 points he was behind Westbrook in only 12 games, since that would mean he was outscoring Russell by nearly 20 points a game. Then I did the math."
"Even crazier, imagine Russell Westbrook and Serve Ibaka in that team, too."
"Eric Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Clint Capela, Gerald Green, and Danuel House are all out tonight, pretty much half of the rotation. Sure 39% shooting isn't the best, but we won, and he didn't have many options to pass to."
He's Russell Westbrook
"He’s Russell Westbrook, he’s gonna make it regardless of whether he deserves it or not"
James Harden and Russell Westbrook are the iceclimbers confirmed.
Russell westbrook injures his hand as the playoffs begin and harden takes over AND HE EMERGES VICTORIOUS AND THE CROWD GOES WILD
I'd rather not have Russell Westbrook
"""Russell Westbrook is averaging a FUCKING TRIPLE DOUBLE"" was the worst take I've ever heard when they were talking about him vs Harden a few years back. Like harden was averaging 2 less rebounds so obviously Westbrook was more valuable because he got box outs even if his shootings worse and team are worse."

Here’s the forgotten history of a blockbuster move older than some of the players involved. By Ben Cohen Nov. 15, 2019 8:01 am ET SHARE TEXT 9 RESPONSES The long-forgotten deal that altered the course of NBA history decades later almost didn’t happen.  The clock was ticking on the Seattle SuperSonics to make their first-round pick in the 1997 draft, and only at the last possible moment did they agree to move down nine spots in exchange for the Denver Nuggets’ second-round pick in 1998.  “That trade went down to 5 or 10 seconds left,” said Wally Walker, the former Sonics general manager. “It was as big a game of timing chicken as I’ve experienced.”  It turned out to be fortunate that Walker didn’t blink. Those five seconds would change the future of the league.  That seemingly trivial swap is the reason the Los Angeles Clippers were able to acquire Paul George from the Oklahoma City Thunder more than two decades later as they also signed Kawhi Leonard and shifted the NBA’s balance of power one night last summer. It also allowed the team formerly known as the Sonics to secure one of the greatest trade hauls of all time: two promising players and possibly seven first-round draft picks.  “Whoa,” Walker said. “How about that?”  The most fascinating trade in recent memory is a window into how NBA teams get built over time and how even basketball assets can appreciate in ways that nobody could have anticipated. This was a blockbuster deal that might determine the league’s next champion in Los Angeles and produced an unprecedented bounty for Oklahoma City. And it began so long ago that it predates the careers—and even the lives—of the players and executives involved.  Thunder general manager Sam Presti was in college. George was in elementary school. Oklahoma City guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander wasn’t even born yet.  The 30-Year NBA Trade It started with that innocuous trade in 1997. It continued when Walker used his 1998 second-round pick on a high-schooler named Rashard Lewis who blossomed into an All-Star. And then it was dormant until 2007.  That’s when the Sonics hired a 29-year-old general manager. His name was Sam Presti.  “I am not sure I was thinking about much other than trying to act like I knew what I was doing and just making my way to the end of each day,” Presti said.  Lewis was entering free agency ready to command a huge salary, and the Sonics weren’t paying to keep him as they were rebuilding. But when Lewis struck a deal with the Orlando Magic, the Sonics also didn’t want to let him walk for nothing. Presti devised an inventive way to split the difference.  He convinced Lewis to sign with the Sonics—so they could immediately trade him to the Magic.  It was a win-win-win scenario. Lewis made nearly $15 million more, the Magic secured an extra year on his contract and the Sonics generated an equally useful “traded player exception” worth about $9.5 million. This was a groundbreaking idea for a time before general managers were seen as mad scientists in the superhero universe of the NBA. The average fan didn’t know who they were, what they did or why anyone should pay attention to their creative salary-cap maneuvering.  How long ago was 2007? Presti remembers being awed that Lewis had a mindblowing new gadget. It was the iPhone.  But even then, the smartest way to build a sports team was to search for value where nobody was looking, and the market inefficiency of the moment was the systemic misvaluation of draft picks. The Sonics decided to become hoarders. They collected draft picks because they understood it was an inherently risky strategy—and they were right. Presti whiffed on a draft pick named Rodrigue Beaubois, for example, and it didn’t matter because he also hit on Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden in 2007, 2008 and 2009.   He plucked those superstars with Seattle’s own picks. But he also nailed one more pick in the middle of this spectacular run that originally belonged to another team—and Presti had Rashard Lewis to thank for it.  The Sonics hadn’t wasted their pile of cash on a player to make their bad team marginally better. They used their $9.5 million to accumulate even more draft picks. When the Phoenix Suns were looking to dump salary in July 2007, Seattle had space to absorb the expiring contract of Kurt Thomas. But to get rid of the basketball equivalent of a toxic asset, the Suns would have to attach two first-round picks.  The executive on the other side of the trade is no longer the general manager of the Suns. He’s now the coach of the Golden State Warriors.  “Oh my god,” Steve Kerr said. “What’s the six degrees of separation—Kevin Bacon? Kurt Thomas is now a Kevin Bacon.”  The Kevin Bacon of the NBA was traded again seven months later for another draft pick. By now Presti had turned Rashard Lewis—a player he wasn’t going to sign—into 2008, 2009 and 2010 first-rounders. It was time to turn his picks into human beings.  The first pick in his stash was the No. 24 spot in 2008. Presti drafted Serge Ibaka. Eight years later, after the Sonics had become the Thunder, Ibaka was a productive NBA player with one year left on his contract. Presti maximized his remaining value by sending him to Orlando in 2016 for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis.  Oladipo and Sabonis spent one season with the Thunder. Then they were flipped in stunning fashion in 2017 for Paul George.  Now one All-Star who was going to leave Seattle had become another All-Star who otherwise wouldn’t have come to Oklahoma City.  Kurt Thomas is now a Kevin Bacon.—Steve Kerr The pairing of George and Westbrook didn’t work out the way the Thunder envisioned, but it helped persuade Westbrook to stay when Durant left and sold George on signing a long-term deal in 2018. The Thunder banked on having both for the primes of their careers. They did not anticipate George asking out last summer to play with Leonard.  This put the Thunder in an odd position. Even though their best player was basically demanding a trade, they also knew the Clippers were desperate to keep Leonard away from the rival Lakers. Suddenly the Thunder had extraordinary leverage.  They were able to extract a remarkable price for one player: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari, the Miami Heat’s first-round picks in 2021 and 2023, the Clippers’ first-round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026 and the right to swap picks with the Clippers in 2023 and 2025.  What was once a 1998 second-round pick compounded and became two players and potentially seven first-round picks through 2026.  They hadn’t simply traded Paul George. It was as if they had traded Kawhi Leonard, too. The Thunder got a massive return on investment for perhaps the best player in the NBA even though they’ve never had him under contract.   Kawhi Leonard eyed Paul George and brought him to the Clippers. PHOTO: EZRA SHAW/GETTY IMAGES The Thunder essentially swapped their today for the Clippers’ tomorrow. There has never been a trade with so much future value on one side. The player they draft in 2026 might very well be doing his sixth-grade homework right now—and Presti is the first to admit that he couldn’t have imagined how one of his first decisions in 2007 would be paying dividends now.  “The idea that anything we were doing could have 25-year performance never occurred to me,” he said.  The two people indirectly responsible for his deals feel the same way.  Allan Bristow, the retired Denver executive, spends his time fishing and hunting these days. On the night George was traded, Bristow was babysitting his grandchildren. He did not know about his unlikely role in the saga. “Heck no!” he said.  Wally Walker is now a money manager, and he’ll soon get to see the profits of this deal for himself: He recently accepted an invitation to an NBA game from one of his friends in Seattle.  That friend happens to be Steve Ballmer —the owner of the Clippers.  SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Would you rather be the Thunder or the Clippers in this deal? Join the discussion.

"I think it's tough to justify him over Jordan, Durant, or LeBron looking at points per 75 possessions.  He has had a great regular season last year, but is rather unsuccessful in the playoffs and a 1-year peak isn't enough for me to say he's better than the 3 of them.  A toss-up between Steph for the #4 spot to me, I think Steph is better.  Put some statistics below.  If you want to count Wilt, who knows where he lands, but I'm sure he has a good case to be put higher than him.

Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook plays in the NBA. If anything, the Clippers own you."
Yeah but Russell Westbrook said he's bad so we're gonna blindly follow that now /s
Russell Westbrook looks like a cockroach
"that if you just expected Russell Westbrook was going to become a shooter by moving to Houston, you are an idiot. If you think people thought that would happen, you are also an idiot."
he's never had that ability. I don't think Houston brought in Russell Westbrook to not shoot.
I don't understand Russell Westbrook... Can someone ELI5 him to me
he’s going to be Efficient Russell Westbrook when he reaches his final form. that’s scary
Russell Westbrook comes back and the defense turns to shit. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
That would be the most Russell Westbrook thing ever.
"I know it's a soft call, but Russell Westbrook is so dumb for even doing that. Why bother risking a FOURTH foul in the first quarter by grabbing your defenders arm when you don't even need to do it? Just play as straight as possible when you're in bad foul trouble."
Russell Westbrook woooweeee. 4 fouls before the end of Q1.
Four fouls on Russell Westbrook in the first quarter is not ideal
"&gt; There was no team willing to give back a superstar player in the return... but there are certainly teams that would have taken future firsts to move the contract if simply ""moving him"" had been the goal.  I think you're half right. The other scenario isn't really a plausible scenario at all.  If they traded Paul and picks and got nothing in return, they couldn't have entertained that.   This was the Rockets and Harden preferring a 30y/o Westbrook over a 34y/o Paul to prolong their ability to compete. All the analytics say that Paul had experienced a rapid decline in Houston last year. He was so bad last year, they couldn't simply run it back with him. They had tried to trade him, but nobody was going to make the deal and allow the Rockets to still be competitive. Then Russell Westbrook became available and it met the objectives of Morey, the Rockets, and Harden."
If you ask Enes Kanter it's Russell Westbrook
"You think Rockets can 100% beat Nuggets and Jazz in a 7 games series? I'm not saying he is scoring only player, Wilt was a god damn assist champ once. The thing is he is doing everything by himself. His usage is way too high. Whenever he is off the court in the playoffs, the Rockets became clueless. They have no idea how to play without Harden. Unless he can pull a 2016 Lebron James, he isn't going to win it all. Russell Westbrook is too inconsistent."
He's all the bad things about Russell Westbrook without any of the good.
russell westbrook is underrated by this sub
"&gt;Back in June, GM Daryl Morey told the media that he would not trade Paul and ended up dealing him to OKC for Russell Westbrook and a pair of first-rounders later in the summer.  This makes it sound like Houston got two first rounders in the trade."
"To me, he plays more like Russell Westbrook. No in terms of the way they play, but the way they approach the game."
"RUSSELL WESTBROOK ISN'T ON HERE BABY, THANKS FOR THIS STAT, I'LL BE SURE TO USE IT."
"Also he does have a rational reason to be upset, given how he was directly told that he wasn't going to be traded.  Obviously Russell Westbrook going on the market changed things from when he was told that and operating on pinkie promises isn't exactly the best kind of business, but he was still told that he wasn't getting traded and then got traded."
Exactly. Also I'm sure Morey had no way of knowing that he'd be able to trade an enormous negative asset for Russell fucking Westbrook lol
"I think it's the 9 assists. Wilts highest career average was like 7, right?  Yeah 9 assists is a really difficult threshold to hit repeatedly-- only 11 guys in the league are even averaging 7+ this season, even with our tiny sample size. Last year only Russell Westbrook averaged 9+"
They’re currently trying to form a super team with Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony
"&gt;Chris Paul was sent to the Thunder this offseason, and the move doesn’t seem to sit well with him. The point guard recently sat down with Kevin Hart, and the comedian asked Paul if any trade he’s been involved in has felt like he was “stabbed in the back” and Paul’s respond was noteworthy.  &gt;“Absolutely,” Paul said of having the feeling of being stabbed in the back (via Dan Feldman of NBC Sports). “This last situation was one of them. The GM there in Houston, he don’t owe me nothing. You know what I mean? He may tell me one thing but do another thing. But you just understand that that’s what it is.”  &gt;Back in June, GM Daryl Morey told the media that he would not trade Paul and ended up dealing him to OKC for Russell Westbrook and a pair of first-rounders later in the summer. Paul has been traded three times in his career (four if you include the Lakers veto).    Saved you a click. There's nothing in the article worth reading."
I think our second option is pretty ass in the west and we have Russell Westbrook
"I said the last 30 mvp years. What do you think is the modern era?  2018-19 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (Voting) 2017-18 James Harden, Houston Rockets (Voting) 2016-17 Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder (Voting) 2015-16 Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors (Voting) 2014-15 Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 2013-14 Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder 2012-13 LeBron James, Miami Heat 2011-12 LeBron James, Miami Heat 2010-11 Derrick Rose, Chicago Bulls 2009-10 LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2008-09 LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2007-08 Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers 2006-07 Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks 2005-06 Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2004-05 Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2003-04 Kevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves 2002-03 Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2001-02 Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2000-01 Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers 1999-00 Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers 1998-99 Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1997-98 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1996-97 Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1995-96 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1994-95 David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs 1993-94 Hakeem Olajuwon, Houston Rockets 1992-93 Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns 1991-92 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1990-91 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls   This is the modern era 90s and beyond. There are only 4 unique back to back MVP winners in the entire span of 30 years, which is once again the modern era. Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Tim Duncan, and Lebron James. if you count MJ who already had multiple MVPs in the 80s as a unique mvp back to back winner than at best you're talking 5 people who have done it in the modern era. That is an extremely uncommon individual feat.   Individual back to back winners are extremely uncommon."
Russell Westbrook has also only played 8 games this season.
Russell Westbrook is not having a great year statistically. It’s clear. But he’s still doing things to help the team and it’s clear in the win-loss column.
"wtf i love the thunder, paul george and russell westbrook now  source: i hate the thunder, paul george and russell westbrook"
"But we also think he can bounce back at some point.  RUSSELL IS A FORMER MVP.  If Lonzo ever became a multiple all star, won an MVP, or did half the shit Westbrook has accomplished, he would get more leeway too.  You see where your comparison fails?"
Russell Westbrook deserves to be the NBA logo now.
"Russell ""Jimi Hendrix"" Westbrook"

Russell Westbrook is weird    Paul George is becoming consistently consistent for once 
Is Thunderstruck 2 gonna feature Paul George or Russell Westbrook?
"Russell ""John Starks"" Westbrook."
"#Anyone wondering why Paul George should be considered a front runner for the MVP, he doesn't just have to carry an entire team, he has to carry an entire team and *Russell Westbrook*"
Westbrook needs to watch some Lance highlights. Russell bb you gotta put your hips into it!
"Jeremy Lin, Raymond Felton, Dennis Schroder. These are all players that are better than Russell Westbrook "
"Imagine being Paul George, playing like an MVP and Russell Westbrook is straight up tanking your entire bid by shooting your team out of games that you are carrying them in."
Russell Westbrook On A Farm
I love Russell Westbrook
[Brett Dawson] Teammates had to push Russell Westbrook back there as he was walking toward official Tom Washington and shouting about the no-call on his attempted dunk. Dennis Schröder talked to Washington and held out a “stand down” arm toward Westbrook. 
"I saw Russell Westbrook at a grocery store in Oklahoma City yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
Russell Westbrook is a market size truther stay work
"Russell Westbrook - because he's already very proficient at getting himself triple doubles and his new 'improved' defense involves a lot of getting in passing lanes/swiping at balls. If he has a good night reading a guard or two that aren't as secure with the ball he could feasibly do it, tbh. "
"Also why is Russell Westbrook critizised for ""stat padding"", yet praise Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson for doing the same thing?"
"If they don’t, then explain to me why Russell Westbrook isn’t being considered as the best or the second best player in the NBA currently?  Winning is important whether you like it or not. "

"I saw Russell Westbrook at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.  57"

"Since the day I was born, my mama has always told me that I’m “too white” to do the things that I love to do. If I had a nickel for every time she said “you’re just a lil’ white boy,” I’d be sittin’ pretty. I wouldn’t have all this student debt, either. That’s for sure.  Here’s the thing— she ain’t wrong, though. I’m what you call a “reverse Oreo.” On the inside, I’m an Atlanta-based trap lord who balls bigger than LaVar in his dreams. But, on the outside, I’m whiter than a fresh jar of marshmallow fluff. I know, it's tacky. But, I am what I am. I love to rap. . . which is not a particularly “white” activity. I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play.  That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luka Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luka Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luka does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luka Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope.

Maybe Russell Westbrook this time!
"When reading the above comment, I recommend reading ""Ah, it appears I have been whooshed,"" in the Russell Westbrook ""Ah! That's pretty interesting,"" voice in your head."
"&gt;	Oklahoma City Thunder’s Steven Adams isn’t afraid to throw ‘bows on the court, or when writing a book. In Adams’ book, ‘My Life, My Fight’, which just hit bookshelves, he fired shots at his former teammate, Reggie Jackson.  &gt;In excerpts posted on Twitter, Adams calls Jackson a “fool” for thinking he should start over Russell Westbrook and that the Thunder “forgot about him pretty quickly” following his trade to the Detroit Pistons:"
"https://youtu.be/wjWrjQpNBsA  Fun fact, Russell Westbrook has done the same ""dirty"" move before too. Idk what the fuck is so dirty about going for a steal but whatever."
"&gt; Russell Westbrook is a fabulous player. He is extremely underrated. Pure class. HOWEVER, he is a horrible offball player, and it shows. He moves so little away from the ball. I'm not gonna get into the neverending argument of whose fault that is, his or Donovan/Brook's. But it's a reality.  Yeah. Once he's passed the ball he's just hanging out. Are people really leaving him open though? I'd think you'd still want to stay on top of Westbrook.  He's also a strong offensive rebounder so that's another reason to have his man stay with him."
"Reggie Jackson finished 11-16, with 32 points, 1 assist, 9 rebounds.   Kevin Durant: 5-21, 15 points, 4 assists, 13 rebounds.    Russell Westbrook: 6-24, 15 points, 7 assists, 9 rebounds.    Jackson had 5 points in the final minute to help OKC erase a 75-80 deficit and send it to overtime, and then had 6 of OKC’s 12 points in overtime.   An extremely underrated game from Jackson. I’m not a fan of how he acted in OKC leading up to his trade, but he honestly bailed out the Thunder so hard this game.   KD’s MVP season, Thunder about to go down 3-1 in the first round, and Jackson comes up with the game of his career.  Who knows what would’ve happened if the Thunder end up losing in the first round in 2014. The whole landscape of the NBA might be different.  "
"Don’t put Colin Cowherd in the same sentence as Stephen A. Cowherd’s takes are just as horrible as Ryan Hollins. The dude said Ben Simmons is a Top 5 player in the league behind James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Giannis. Also said John Wall would never be a champinshop point guard because he doesn’t have a “father figure”."
"I appreciate your feedback, thank you.  I think OKC is a fantastic team, and they've been built in a fascinating way. Here's what I'll say.    1. Their offensive rebounding prowess allows them to get away with so much. They create so few easy shots, and they should thank the lord for Adams every day.  2. Russell Westbrook is a fabulous player. He is extremely underrated. Pure class. HOWEVER, he is a horrible offball player, and it shows.  He moves so little away from the ball. I'm not gonna get into the neverending argument of whose fault that is, his or Donovan/Brook's. But it's a reality.  3.  This team has spacing issues and Donovan does so so little to mitigate them. They don't move off the ball well, they react poorly to unique defensive looks, they rely faaar too much on PG and Westbrooks brilliance with the ball. I think it hurts their secondary players development.    4. The sad part is they COULD be a great off ball team. Westbrook doesn't have shooting gravity, but he could put sooo much pressure on the defense by attacking the basket.  George has phenomenal timing. But their offensive sets feel like they only have one look at a time in terms of their offball movement. And people rarely move with the dribble. T-ferg, Diallo, and Grant don't have a strong enough feel for movement to bail them out and create easy scoring options away from the ball which means their shot need to fall to stay a threat.  Grant has great moments, but occasionally looks lost in the Westbrook Adams two-step.  It's a great thing Westbrook can manufacture so much offense both for himself and as a passer. George is magnificent.    Their Defense is phenomenal and they are a fantastic team. They can ride their stars a long way. But right now, I'm projecting some tough spots in the playoffs if their offense continues to stall. No surprise they are so low in ORTG. (which is not the be all end all but is telling).  Hope this answers your question!"
"&gt; Yup, Kawhi was playing with legends  And poor Harden was only playing with scrubs like (at the time) 3x scoring champ+3x first team all-nba Kevin Durant, 2x all-nba 2nd team Russell Westbrook and first team all-defense Serge Ibaka.  If only he had 38 year old Duncan, 37 year old Manu, and 32 year old Parker to take attention off of him, he would have really thrived!"
You want the Pelicans to go from the likes of Tim Frazier and Elfrid Payton at the PG spot to Russell Westbrook to pair with Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis?
"Ingles, Rubio, Mitchell, are a combined 5-24.  Which is basically 1 Russell Westbrook."
Fans may not be KD friendly but the players that have to actually step foot on court and try to stop him know exactly what they’re talking about. He’s been an unstoppable volume scorer since Texas. Only person to stop him from leading the league in scoring every year was Russell Westbrook 
"I'd say:      1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. James Harden   4. Stephen Curry   5. Giannis Antetokounmpo   6. Kawhi Leonard   7. Anthony Davis   8. Russell Westbrook 9. Paul George   10. Kyrie/Dame/Jokic/Embiid      The rest, I agree with. You could switch up Curry and Harden, PG and Westbrook or Embiid/Dame. But I'd definitely say that Harden is top 3 at this point. I see an argument for Curry over Harden, but this is just how I'd put it."
I don't think Lebron is taking into account that the Warriors had to get through the Blazers and a KD-Russell Westbrook OKC prior to their win. I don't think the Hawks and Raptors really compare.  Also Harrison Barnes.
"Lebron has never lost an MVP to voter fatigue. There are three seasons in which he was better than the actual winner of the MVP though, which are 05-06 (Steve Nash), 10-11 (Derrick Rose), and 16-17 (Russell Westbrook). The problem is that in each of those years, there was someone else that was better than the MVP winner as well as Lebron.   You have Dirk in 05-06, Dwight Howard in 10-11, and Harden/Kawhi in 16-17.   He wasn't good enough to win one prior to 05-06. Didn't have MVP caliber seasons in 06-07 or 07-08. After his last one, Kevin Durant, Curry x2, and Harden's were all clearly deserved.   2010-2011 is the only one I think you could make a case for him to deserve, so at most, Lebron got snubbed once.  Jordan on the other hand should have 2 of Magic Johnson's MVP's and Charles Barkley's MVP. He was the best player those years and didn't win it.   Jordan got robbed in 1997 as well, but they did the make up call for him in 1998. Jordan should have been 97 MVP, and Malone should have been 98, so those should have just been flip flopped. "
"Yeah? Bradley Beal is a better complimentary player than Russell Westbrook, but WB is far better. Same situation with Wall and Lowry."

"People with OCD often have ritual like routines, that they believe dictate their luck or performance.  Westbrook does this  People with OCD often get thrown off when their routines don’t go as they are supposed to.  Westbrook is an example of this  People with OCD often believe certain numbers or symbols can imply good or bad outcomes  Westbrook does this  People with OCD are often neat freaks, and make a constant effort for things to be clean or in place.  Westbrook does this  People with OCD often believe things or numbers have to be set a certain way, or they can have anxiety or panic attacks.  IF Westbrook does have OCD, which evidently it is likely he does, this would explain why he is so set on getting triple doubles.   It could also explain why he only wears his pregame outfits once, and never again.   It could also explain why Steven Adams was poking fun at Westbrook for having OCD in [this article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant).   It would also make sense that that article actually has 10-15 different signs that Westbrook has OCD.  "
"The chaos that is the Western Conference standings REAL. Look, some of the 14 teams are eventually going to give way due to either injuries or an ill-timed slump. Nonetheless, the West playoff picture doesn't look likely to get much clearer any time soon. Both FiveThirtyEight's projections and those based on ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI) have 11 teams finishing .500 or better on average, and BPI projects all 14 teams in the playoff race to win an average of at least 38 games. With so many teams in the mix, every game will count in a wild second half of the season. The trade deadline (and buyout market) may also be an important differentiator in a setting where an extra win or two could be the difference between making the playoffs with a realistic chance of a first-round upset or going home early.    ***The death of the traditional NBA big man*** NOT REAL. The traditional big man isn't extinct, but he is now a spot specialist who is no longer essential -- and often a liability -- to his team's success. Rim protection is still a priority for NBA defense, which is why players with elite defensive abilities like Rudy Gobert, DeAndre Jordan and Clint Capela can play 35 minutes for competitive teams, so long as they're willing to roll and run to the rim with authority on the offensive end. Though he's not as springy, Steven Adams' mastery of defensive bully-ball and creative goonery makes him indispensable to the Thunder's identity, and energy bigs like Montrezl Harrell are invaluable in an up-and-down game. And there's always the occasional nights when a Jusuf Nurkic gets loose against a small-ball unit.  Teams will also find use for a Tyson Chandler, who can stabilize a young defense, or a Boban Marjanovic, who can use his uncommon size to take over a game for 10 or 12 possessions. But these guys are now the exceptions instead of the rules.  Until further notice, a present-day NBA big man must brandish offensive skills like Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns and Blake Griffin. They must be able to stretch the floor, serve as fulcrums through which the half-court offense can operate, command double-teams -- and when those extra bodies come, be able to exploit the defense with the pass. As Jokic has demonstrated, it's not so much the range from deep (the Nuggets' big man is shooting only 31 percent from beyond the arc this season). It's the versatility, the uncanny ability to morph one's skills into whatever the conditions of the game demand.  Without those multiple arrows in their quiver, big men will have a hard time both staying on the floor and drawing the big paychecks their smaller contemporaries earn in free agency.  -- Kevin Arnovitz   The road to home court in the West will be tricky, even for LeBron James. Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images The Lakers' chances at a top-3 seed in the West playoffs NOT REAL. The Lakers came into this season already needing time to learn one another with a new cast surrounding the young prospects to go with LeBron James. And as good as the Lakers have looked at times this season, they've had to deal with injuries and suspensions that have disrupted their ability to become a finished product. So while they're capable of winning big at Golden State, they can also lose to Orlando twice. The recent injuries to James and Rajon Rondo, the Lakers' two leaders, will help the young players get into a groove but still require more time for Luke Walton's team to reach its potential once everyone is healthy again.  The Lakers will eventually hit their stride, as Magic Johnson predicts. But with the margin of error so slim in the Western Conference, they may not win enough games to ultimately finish in the top three or even four ahead of teams such as the Oklahoma City Thunder or the charging Houston Rockets.  -- Ohm Youngmisuk  The Raptors as the most dangerous team in the Eastern Conference REAL. When the Raptors have been healthy this season, they have easily been the East's most complete team. Kawhi Leonard has looked like an MVP candidate again after last season's injury issues, Kyle Lowry has been one of the league's best ball distributors, Pascal Siakam has continued to progress toward a possible All-Star berth and Serge Ibaka is having one of his best seasons in years. Toronto goes two-deep at every position, has length and athleticism to spare, and can play virtually any style against any team.  The Raptors do have some weaknesses: They are a team full of streaky 3-point shooters, Lowry's playoff resume has its share of disappearances on it and the amount of injuries they've already had -- plus Leonard's issues last season -- bear monitoring. But in an Eastern Conference in which each of the contenders has flaws, that is enough -- for now -- to tip the scales in their favor despite the latest run by the Milwaukee Bucks.  -- Tim Bontemps  Paul George as MVP favorite NOT REAL. George has a strong case, to be sure. He's having a career season, playing at a Defensive Player of the Year level, and has propelled the Thunder to the upper crust of the West despite injuries and uneven play for Russell Westbrook. But the competition is strong -- and statistically superior. George's climb to an MVP would probably need to feature the Thunder overachieving and finishing atop the West while he continues to roll on a hot streak that gets him somewhere in the 27- or 28-point-per-game range.  Here's how tough the competition is, just in the West: George could be DPOY and finish in the top three or four of the MVP race, yet not even make first- or second-team All-NBA. It ain't easy being a forward in today's NBA.  -- Royce Young   Could this be the end of the Spurs playoff streak? Gregg Popovich &amp; Co. will have to navigate a difficult West. Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports Serious trouble for the Spurs' 21-season playoff streak REAL. The Spurs no longer possess what coach Gregg Popovich calls the ""corporate knowledge"" to lean on that they once had during the Big Three era with Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Think about it: San Antonio lost three All-NBA defenders before the season even tipped off in Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green and Dejounte Murray, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL during the preseason. And for a Spurs franchise that believes lockdown defense should be the foundation to everything it does on the court, that's a devastating blow.  Throw in the loaded West and the fact that the Spurs are trying to maintain their normal high standards with eight new players (10 if you count two-way players), and it's a recipe for the possible end of a postseason streak that started with a team that included David Robinson, Avery Johnson, Vinny Del Negro, Will Perdue and Chuck Person -- who are now all in their 50s!  -- Michael C. Wright  The Jimmy Butler trade made the Sixers better REAL. Did it make the Sixers better this season? Not necessarily (more on that below). But in the NBA, the goal is to collect star talent and figure out the rest later. In adding Butler to its core of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, Philadelphia has unquestionably done that.  In the short term, however, the trade only exacerbated a depth issue the Sixers were already dealing with when the season began. Outside of their star trio and JJ Redick, coach Brett Brown is in a constant struggle to find players he can rely on. The Sixers would love to find a couple more depth pieces on the buyout market this winter like they did last year, when they landed Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova -- moves that helped transform them into a juggernaut down the stretch and lift them into the second round of the playoffs.  Even if adding depth doesn't happen until the summer, though, the addition of Butler raised Philadelphia's long-term ceiling. That alone is enough to justify the move.  -- Tim Bontemps  De'Aaron Fox's case for best player from the 2017 draft REAL. Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum and Lauri Markkanen might beg to differ, but you certainly can make a case for the Sacramento Kings' electric point guard as being the best player so far from the Class of 2017. Why? First of all, you have to be special to lead the Kings to a winning record after so many lackluster years. Fox is the main reason for that with his scoring, passing, steals, quickness and improved 3-point shooting. The former University of Kentucky star also deserves Western Conference All-Star reserve consideration. Fox has turned the Kings from a laughingstock to a true playoff contender, and he still has room to get better. If Fox were in a bigger market, he would get more recognition for his stellar second season. But game recognizes game, and he will ultimately get his respect if he continues to play on this elite level.  -- Marc Spears   "

I love to play basketball, which is also not really known as a “Caucasian pass-time,” if you will. I even have dudes on my Y-League team that say I “talk gangster.” No one ever wants to be that guy. Alas, here I stand. Based on what I’ve said, one could understand why I have a certain appreciation for guys like Larry Bird or Steve Nash. Those were two dudes that, despite all odds, made it to the NBA looking like milk-truck drivers. Overall, LeBron James is my favorite player. But, it's always a little exciting when you see a white dude block him twice on the same play. That white dude is a man by the name of Luka Doncic. For us white kids, the athleticism of a LeBron James or a Russell Westbrook just isn’t really in the cards. I mean, we have Mac McLung at Georgetown puttin’ on for the honkeys. . . but other than that, there just isn’t that much God-given bounce to go around. I mean, the movie White Guys Can’t Jump didn’t just come out of nowhere. Stereotypes exist for a reason. However, Luka Doncic is quite athletic. He was doubted during the pre-draft process because scouts didn’t think he could adjust to the speed of the NBA after coming over from Europe. Yeah, I think he’s doing just fine. He hasn’t seemed to miss a step after being the MVP of the Euro League. He might not blaze past people like a Kemba Walker or Kyrie Irving, but he holds his own and makes it look easy around the basket as well. Speaking of finishes— for us white kids, the Euro-step was a staple if slashing was your game. It was a glorious move that created new space and angles for guys like Manu Ginobili. It was a cornerstone of white boy ballin’ until James Harden went and appropriated it. But, Luka Doncic did it right back. He went and appropriated that step-back jumper The Beard loves so much. Have you ever seen Doncic hit a step back that’s smoother than Harden’s? Because I have. I see it in every highlight reel that Luca has. And, he doesn’t sport a wack-ass beard while doing it. Double win. Now, this last one is something all basketball fans can relate to, especially if you play a lot of pick-up. You ever see a white guy make some nice moves on the court but he still looks really white while doing it? Like SO WHITE it kinda makes you a little itchy? Cough cough Joe Ingles cough cough. You know what I’m talking about, right? Anyway, Luka does all of these moves and looks smoother than butter dipped in olive oil. His game has so much finesse that he attended the same academy that Gunna rapped about on the hook of “YOSEMITE.” He’s out here making dudes look foolish, like they can’t believe they’re getting crossed up by a saltine in Nikes. Not only is Luka Doncic a baller and should be around for the next 12-15 years in the NBA, he puts a smile on my face. He is the next Great White Hope. He gives all of us charge-takers a glimmer of pride as we watch from our couches and talk about our JV glory days. He's our hero."
"Point Guards have huge room for growth, particularly in the areas of shot selection and making smart passes.  Look at guys like Kemba Walker, and Russell Westbrook, and you can see examples of guys who were able to improve in those areas dramatically over the years.  If I were a young team I would be more than happy to take the chance on DSJ.  However, if the Mavs are convinced he has peaked I understand the desire to trade him.  However, my biggest concern is that they don't trade him for a veteran instead of another young player or draft asset.  With Luka playing so well there is a certain temptation to build a playoff team around him now, but this is a huge mistake.  This is what New Orleans did with AD, and what Cleveland did with young Lebron, and is the primary reason both those players left/are likely to leave.  A smart team building around Luka should try and build a team that peaks 4-8 years from now.  That is when Luka will be entering his prime, and more importantly it is when Luka will be making his decision in free agency.  The only assets that should matter to Dallas are those that will still be relevant then.  DSJ is by far the best of those assets.  If they trade him for another young player that they think is a better fit fair enough, but if they trade him for a guy like Vucevic I think that is a huge mistake.  "
"assist numbers don't tell the whole story, if we're going by that logic then Russell Westbrook is the best passer in the league and has been for the past 3 or so seasons.  "
I feel bad that fashion icons such as James Harden and Russell Westbrook will have to wear something so fucking ugly.
Russell Pumpfakington Westbrook 
His defense isn't nearly as bad as some say.  He is a better defender than Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook..... and about the same as LeBron James the last three seasons.  Earlier in his career he missed switches and had issues under the basket. Now his issues are usually a result of leading the league in minutes and having an ungodly offensive load.  I didn't like Harden for years but have just accepted that he is THAT good.
"Among players who log at least 30 minutes per game, only 165 players have a better TS% than Russell Westbrook."
Westbrook Russell
"You might be right.  Year|MVP|PER Leader|PER 2019|N/A|Anthony Davis|30.8 2018|James Harden|James Harden|29.8 2017|Russell Westbrook|Russell Westbrook|30.6 2016|Steph Curry|Steph Curry|31.5 2015|Steph Curry|Anthony Davis|30.8 2014|Kevin Durant|Kevin Durant|29.8 2013|Lebron James|Lebron James|31.6 2012|Lebron James|Lebron James|30.7 2011|Derrick Rose|Lebron James|27.3 2010|Lebron James|Lebron James|31.1 2009|Lebron James|Lebron James|31.7  So correctly predicts 8/10 of the last MVPs. Notably doesn't predict 2015 (AD and Westbrook were ahead of Steph), and completely off 2011 (D Rose was only 9th in PER, Lebron had the highest but much lower than his usual standards). "

Did you know that Russell Westbrook won the MVP award with his team as a 6th seed? 
"He's the MVP this season, but too many people care about being a high seed. Giannis hasn't been the best player in the league this season, and it sucks that he's going to win MVP. Harden should be 3-peating (he got robbed against Russell Westbrook too). People got boners about Westbrook's triple double season, but Harden was better that season too. Funny how Westbrook averaged a triple double last season and this season and no one seems to give nearly as much of a fuck."
"Jokes on the them, [now they look even more homeless](https://www.thesportsgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Russell-Westbrook-Shredded-Shirt.png)"
Do you remember what Russell was Westbrook did a couple of years ago? 
"&amp;#x200B;  * Portland went 28-38 in 2012, then drafted Damian Lillard with the 6th pick, they made the playoffs Dame's second year and won 54 games. He averaged 19 PPG right out of the gate, and over 20 PPG by his second season and was arguably their best player.  * The 2010-11 Warriors missed the playoffs with a 36-46 record, they Drafted Klay Thompson with the 11th pick. He averaged 13/2/2 as a rookie, and 17/4/2 as a sophomore. They made the playoffs his second year, and likely would have made the playoffs his rookie year had Steph not missed 50+ games. His rookie season, Klay was their 3rd best player behind Steph and David Lee. 2nd Best healthy player behind David Lee.  * The Sacramento Kings missed the playoffs with 33 wins in 2017, they proceeded to draft DeAaron Fox with the 5th pick and are in the playoff hunt this year. Fox is clearly their best player.  * OKC won 23 games, got the 3rd pick (James Harden), then won 50 games. Granted Russell Westbrook improved considerably, but Harden was a 6MOY candidate as a rookie. * Dallas won 24 games last year, drafted Luka Dočić and before throwing in the towel, trading 4/5 starters and tanking, were 25-28. They were a fringe playoff contender and could have snagged the 8th spot without the KP trade.   &amp;#x200B;"
Harden never plays at an MVP level on defense. We focus on his level on offense because that's typically what the award is for these days anyway (see: Russell Westbrook)
The idea that this years MVP race and that years MVP race are comparable is laughable. Neither of these guys are russell westbrook in this scenario.
"Deadspin had a [similar article](https://deadspin.com/are-you-sure-russell-westbrook-should-be-mvp-consider-1793083400) from the 16-17 season where they did a Player A vs Player B comparison, and Player B clearly had better stats. ***Spoiler Alert***  Turn out Player A was Kawhi's averages at that point in the season, and Player B was if Westbrook went 0-0-0 over the last 18 games of the season."
"IMO the East had no answer for the Miami super team. Nobody was able to compete with that level of talent in the East. The only ones that competed with them was a Boston team assembled 5 years ago where even then, they were considered at the tail end of their primes. It's a testament to the greatness of Rondo, Pierce, Garnett, and Allen that they were able to push 3 top 50 all time superstars in their absolute primes to 7. That Indiana team wasn't assembled to beat Lebron right away, but the emergence of Paul George and Lance at the right times allowed them to compete. That Pacers team was about a year or two away from actually making Finals runs but PG broke his leg, Lance left, and Hibbert became a shell of himself for no reason.   &amp;#x200B;  The West on the otherhand somewhat answered the Durant Warriors within a year. In the first year, everyone was caught off guard so they couldn't do much. The very next year, Houston gets CP to help Harden contend with the Warriors. OKC gets Paul George and Melo (who in hindsight ruined their chemistry by being a ball stopper, but at the time people thought he was closer to his prime than past it since he rested a lot in NY), creating a big 4 with Adams. Jazz loses Hayward but finds Donovan Mitchell, arguably one of the most playoff ready rookies in recent history, going head to head with league MVP Russell Westbrook. Spurs with Kawhi and Aldridge were robbed of the chance to go head to head with the Warriors in 2017. If healthy, they might've actually destroyed the Warriors dynasty, considering how good they were defensively, playoff experience, shooting, and bench.   The West sees competition and tries their best to match it. The East ""makes moves,"" but they're trading away years of draft picks for marginal improvements. "
This question doesn't even make sense. Don't you guys see Russell Westbrook is averaging a triple double??
Russell Westbrook I’m assuming 
Russell Westbrook eating a peanut butter jelly sandwich before every game. Just weird. 
"He only seems that way to the media and tbh I don’t always like the way he treats them. But at the same time, he’s gotten a ton of shit from them over the years so I can understand why he’s wary of them as well. Pretty much everyone who has actually known him off the court thinks he’s a stand up guy though. [If you don’t like him after reading this piece by Lee Jenkins, then you probably never will.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant)"
"Russell Westbrook. He infuriates me at times, but I love the passion that he plays with and once you know his backstory it’s hard not to love him "
"Shorter version of Russell Westbrook, which always isn't a bad thing"
Giannis has been super efficient and an amazing defender all while not being the person Russell Westbrook is. He should not and probably will not get the same treatment cause he's had just as good if not better season than Harden. 
"1st Team  Guards: James Harden &amp; Steph Curry  Forwards: Paul George &amp; Giannis Antetokounmpo  Center: Nikola Jokic  2nd Team  Guards: Bradley Beal and Damian Lillard  Forwards: Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard  Center: Joel Embiid  3rd Team  Guards: Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook  Forwards: LeBron James and Blake Griffin  Center: Andre Drummond  Snubs: KAT, Gobert, Kemba, AD(?)"
Russell Westbrook is also an assist leader and is thought of as one of the most selfish players in the NBA. I don't think you know what selfish truly entails kappa.
"&gt;LA's jam going forward could for sure be the old folks home for NBA stars. I think they might have a good shot at Russell Westbrook after his next contract is up.  Cool, the Lakers also are a MLS team too."
Where is Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant?
"Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Joakim Noah. Honorable mention Russell Westbrook. I like him a lot but it's fun to see how salty he gets lol"
He's the next Russell Westbrook imo.
they absolutely do. confidence can make or break players. when players see a bunch of shots go in they become super confident. the opposite is true as well unless you're someone like Russell Westbrook.   this is one where the stats aren't being interpreted correctly. 
"This is why I hate using stats, they just serve to tear down a player most of the time. Russell Westbrook has a higher defensive rating than PG, is he a better defender? No. PG leads the league in steals and deflections, and the eye test shows how good he really is on defense."
**\[OC\]**   40-10-10 games  * LeBron James (career): 6 * James Harden (last three seasons): 12 * Russell Westbrook (last three seasons): 9
"Do you have any specific starts and ends of eras of basketball in mind? I can see:  1946-1979 ""The Classic Era""  1979-2004 ""The Golden Era""  2004-present ""The Modern Era""  In 1979 the 3pt line was introduced. In 2004 the number of teams became a round 30. Obviously the first era was Russell, Wilt, and West, the second was Jordan, Magic and Bird, the third was Kobe, LeBron and Curry.  Alternatively I could divide it in more detail:  1946-56 The Proto Era (Mikan, Zaslofsky)  1956-71 The Classic Era (Russell, Wilt, West, Big O)  1971-84 The Transitional Era (Kareem, Moses, Erving, Gervin)  1984-98 The Flashy Era (Jordan, Magic, Bird, Barkley, Drexler, Hakeem)  1998-14 The Millenial Era (Kobe, Shaq, LeBron, Iverson, Duncan, Nash, Nowitzki, Garnett, Kidd, Wade, Melo, etc.)  2014-present The Just-Chuck-it Era (Curry, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, PG13, Kawhi) "
"Can someone PLEASE tell Russell Westbrook that with any sort of running start he is arguably the best attacking player in the league, stop shooting 3s and just literally run towards the basket/play inside the 3pt line "
HERE COMES RUSSELL WESTBROOK
"People quickly forget just how impressive Russ was in the '16-'17 season immediately after KD left. PG wasn't on the team yet and Adams (who is now their 3rd best player) was nowhere near the level he is at now. Russ single-handedly carried that team into the playoffs. Even more commendable, he forced the best that his teammates could give him out of them by his elite playmaking.

"Anthony Davis is an ineffective basketball player. He is constantly getting away with doing what everyone believes Russell Westbrook is doing, the only difference is that Russell Westbrook actually wins games."
Fuck Russell Westbrook 
"Even if he was good enough to be a top 4 defensive guard in the league (nah), he's going to miss the next 4-6 weeks. It ain't happening.  Marcus Smart, Cory Joseph, Kyle Lowry, Danny Green, Jimmy Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Mike Conley, Derrick White, even Russell Westbrook"
"20ppg (or better) best reflects Westbrook's production during his triple-double seasons. If I dropped the requirement to 10ppg then I'd be comparing players with &lt;50% of Westbrook's scoring to Westbrook. That goes against the purpose of the comment, which was to find players that compare favourably to Russell.  However, in the interest of science, here are the players who get added when the requirement is dropped to 8/8/8: Jason Kidd in '06-'07 and Darrell Walker in '89-'90."
for a superstar Russell westbrook has plays that he has great iq then he does the dumbest things sometimes.... i love the guy but i wish he was a little better at times
"Best player with low basketball I.Q, Russell Westbrook "
"&gt;You obviously haven't tuned in to the Thunder games to be saying what you are.  it's the same line, every time. it's obvious the people that don't watch the games. you can't watch a thunder game and think russell fucking westbrook *hurts* the thunder.   same thing with J. H. (that used to be my nickname for him when Harden was ya know...on our team... :( )"
"VORP thinks Rudy is the 5th most valuable player in the NBA this year. Do you agree?  It also thinks Russell Westbrook has been more valuable than Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard, which almost no one would agree with. VORP is calculated using BPM. DBPM looooooooves rebounds, hence Westbrook having the 4th highest DBPM in the league this year. Russell Westbrook is not the 4th best defender in the league."
The Thunder are 81-18 in the regular season when Russell Westbrook has a triple-double. Seems pretty good to me.
No but I have seen Russell as last name. So they should trade half of their names and become Paul Westbrook and George Russell.
"Rudy ""not an all-star"" Gobert with a higher VORP than:  Joel Embiid  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Lebron James  Paul George  Steph Curry  Russell Westbrook  Karl Anthony-Towns  Blake Griffin  Damian Lillard  Kemba Walker  Ben Simmons  Nikola Vucevic  Kyle Lowry  D'Angelo Russell  Blake Griffin  Dirk Nowitzki  Dwayne Wade  Khris Middleton  LaMarcus Aldridge   ""tHe NbA vALuEs DeFEnSE""  "
"Magic, Curry, Stockton, Oscar, IT, Westbrook, Nash, Kidd, Payton, with room for Russell to immediately jump to 3 if he gets a ring imo"
"I am not denying that Russell Westbrook is highly skilled. I was just commenting on why triple doubles have become more common place than in the past.   Also he is mix of a PG (point guard) that plays like an SG so he already has an advantage of getting assists and points. And players are taking more long range shots (outside of paint) that cause long rebounds when missed so players that are in the back court are getting the rebounds more too. The increase in these stats is expected. Nature of basketball has changed considerably since Magic and MJ days.   I am only trying analyze why, not trying to take away anything from Westbrook."
"I get that rings are a thing, but there's no universe where Tony Parker is in the same ballpark as Russell Westbrook."
lmao if you think Kyrie Irving has had a better career than Russell Westbrook then let me have what you're having
Russell Westbrook for $200 Alex
"https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/1/20/18190015/joel-embiid-vs-russell-westbrook-beef-thunder-76ers  Just an ongoing beef for a while, mostly on court stuff."
"Russell Westbrook has pretty much singlehandedly normalized triple doubles. I remember just 5 years ago, a triple double was crazy. Now it’s kind of just whatever. "
"This is what I've always wanted to say regarding Russ but didn't know exactly how to put it into words. Thanks for this.   Add up the math of anyone's life, sports related or otherwise, and you can find imperfections. Do those imperfections make the superhuman aspects of that person's life any less tremendously incredible?   Sports fandom can get toxic because people use sports to get away from what day-to-day life brings. In that way it's an escape. Fans expect the *best* from these players because they want the best entertainment. When Russell has these incredible feats of athleticism, breaks records, competes as ferociously as anyone, and ultimately shoots 36% from the field there's going to be a focus on the negative aspect of his game. Why is that? I would say it's because of the want of the basic fan to have our entertainment to be the best it can be. But I would also say that that is obviously a flawed way to look at sports. Russell is one of the most compelling players of our generation, not despite, but because of his imperfections. Not only does he play with passion, he enforces his will on the game. That is incredible to watch. I wish everyone could look past what could be perceived as imperfection and see what a brilliant and compelling player Westbrook is. Because the dude is just straight up fun to watch. "
I love Russell Westbrook and I don’t care who knows 
Russell Westbrook fatigue is real
"You’re overcomplicating this to fit your narrative. If Westbrook’s ahead for an outlet he has a 2 on 1 with Paul George. He’s also a much more legitimate threat to attack the basket and score.  The ball moves faster than Russell Westbrook lol and if he’s in a better position to attack on the break, the Thunder are more dangerous. Saying things like “I don’t trust Patterson on the fast break” doesn’t mean it’s effective to have Westbrook grab rebounds"
"Great, now the Pelicans are going to demand Khris Middleton, Nikola Jokic, Russell Westbrook, Blake Griffin, D’Angelo Russell, Nikola Vucevic, Kyle Lowry, Dirk Nowitzki on top of 4 first-round picks and 2 second-round picks for AD."
"The Thunder are scary now that Russell has matured enough to realise his best role is a playmaker and letting his co-star take over, and I can’t help but imagine how good this Westbrook would be with any era KD"
"This is the how impressive Russell Westbrook is.  He’s turned getting triple doubles into some routine, overrated stat."
I don’t know how many triple doubles Russell Westbrook has this season but it feels like he gets one every game 
"The Russell Westbrook slander needs to die, the whole stat padding thing is such a bad dig in the first place, anyone that watches the games and knows basketball knows the guy is a dog, every night out there playing his heart out.  Nobody ever said he was good because of his efficiency, because god damn he is inefficient at times, but the guy does it all and not only that but the whole team succeeds when he puts up those numbers.  Acting like averaging a triple double every year is normal. "
Should Russell Westbrook be executed for having a below average TS%? 
I just had a friend tell me that Russell Westbrook bricked away a 3-1 lead in the same year??? Is that true?
"Be kind, these are mine:  **First Team All-Defensive Team:**  G  Eric Bledsoe   G  Marcus Smart  F  Paul George  F  Anthony Davis  F/C  Myles Turner  .  **2nd Team All-Defensive Team:**  G  Russell Westbrook  G  Malcolm Brogdon  F  Kawhi Leonard  F  Giannis Antetokounmpo  F/C  Rudy Gobert"
D'Angelo and Russ seemed to be getting along with him great during the ASB. I'm going to generalize some. Eastern European and Russian men often have resting asshole face and Jokic is not excluded lol. There were several times when he and Westbrook were joking around and laughing. Watch the bench on this play Russell and Russell are giving him shit for just laying it in. https://streamable.com/njqwh  
"I agree. But KD left Russell Westbrook and a good supporting cast to join an already dominant team that he choked to in the playoffs. LeBron left Mo Williams and an alright supporting cast to form a superteam with 2 other great players in Miami. The intent is absolutely the same, but the circumstances surrounding their decisions is why KD’s move is seen as much worse, even the vitriol LeBron recurved was way more real. "
Why do people act like a player winning an award 2-3 years ago mean they still play at that level?  You don't see Kawhi and Dray defend like DPOYs right now.   You don't see 2x SCORING CHAMPION Russell Westbrook score like that right now. 
"&gt; Then they faced OKC, who had prime Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden.  As much as i agree with everything else, this is not true. And i have to admit that as a Mavs fan. They were all 21-22, only the 2nd year in the playoffs, inexperienced, Harden even was a sophomore. They were this hyper talented group of really young guys, who everyone knew were the future and whose run into the conference finals was already a huge achievement - but they were a couple of years away from their prime and the players they are now (Durant the closest since he's been in the league since 19. But his prime really started close to the MVP season 2-3 years later)."
"If anyone wants to know why thunder fans so vehemently defend Russ despite his shortcomings it’s this  Thunder fans have had a really short history. It’s been really good in the one dark patch where we didn’t know wtf was gonna happen to us, Russ carried us and because of him we stayed competitive and now have PG.   Russell Westbrook is the key reason we are still competitive. Without him our franchise is nothing. So he could shoot 0/30 and our fan base still wouldn’t trade him for like ten number one picks in a row  Yeah it’s stupid and illogical but being a sports fan is like that. You can become invested so much in not only a team, but a player, especially one that sticks by you when it looks like it’s all going to shit "
Russell Westbrook
"You have Davis way the fuck too high. If he was good enough to be the 7th best player in the league, the Pelicans would have won a lot more games since he got there.  You have him above Westbrook. The year after Kevin Durant left, a roster of Russell Westbrook And Some Dudes still made the playoffs."

"I never said anything about sacrificing team success. I’ve seen many occurrences where big men on the thunder intentionally do not get the rebound and let Russell get it, even when the ball is clearly heading towards an okc player that isn’t Russ.   Why does Steven Adams have one of the highest offensive rebound rates, but a weirdly low defensive rebounding rate? He’s giving up rebounds to Westbrook. Westbrook is not as good of a rebounder as his numbers suggest, hence he is stat padding."
Russell Westbrook 20 is too low.  I don't agree with everything else but it's at least debatable. Westbrook isn't he should be higher than 20th.
"&gt;He doesn’t like guys who showboat and try and turn the game into a spectacle        Just to be clear, we're talking about Russell fucking Westbrook here, right?"
"&gt;Giannis is as athletic as anybody to ever play in the NBA  This is an absurd claim, and it's kind of embarrassing that you think this as a Bucks fan. What makes Giannis freaky is the combination of length AND athleticism. His athleticism itself is not that uncommon in the NBA. Russell Westbrook and John Wall are both much more explosive than Giannis, they just don't have his ridiculous physical traits to go with it.  I'm not sure you actually watch the games if you think this.  &amp;#x200B;"

I don't care if this was Kemba's fucking birthday party, there is no reason to favorite him over another player, especially if that player is playing better.   As much as he is my favorite player and can play waaaay better, I want Kemba to be our Russell Westbrook unstoppable PG, he just isn't as good as we want him to be.  In context of the game, yeah he handed out some assists, which is good, but he wasn't shooting well, so like any other coach that had a stash of other all stars to pick from, he made a coaching choice "
rare sighting - Russell Westbrook set an off-ball screen to get a teammate open
The only players who won the MVP award with less than 50 wins since 1980;   Moses Malone in 1981-82 season and Russell Westbrook in 2016-17 season. The mechanics were way different back then and Harden's season isn't as historic as Westbrook's.   The Rockets are on 47W pace. Not going to happen.
"Way too many incorrect generalizations for me to unpack here (""giving every bit of credit for those postseason runs"" or that I think ""his career is on the downtrend""). I think his regular season performances have overshadowed his postseason performances, which is probably what I meant by ""he's never translated his regular season performance..."". for many of the good games, there has been bad and at times, very, very bad. but again, this devolves into me being a hater when I legitimately enjoy watching Russell Westbrook play.   I just don't care about individual greatness nearly as much when basketball is a team sport. I find that it ends up ignoring the other 4 guys on the court, as well as the other 9 or 10 players in the rotation."
"TS% is an important stat, but if you’re in an argument about Russell Westbrook and they’re only argument is TS% then you know they don’t know anything"
A Russell Westbrook rebound is Steven Adams letting the ball go by him 
I’ll start. Russell Westbrook
"It is absolutely true:  &gt;Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, per pbpstats.com. The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  &gt;That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  &gt; After a missed field goal attempt, the results are largely similar. When it’s Westbrook grabbing the board, Oklahoma City is nearly unstoppable, to the tune of a 115.0 offensive rating over the last three years. Curb it back to the last two years (after Paul George joined the team) and that already absurd efficiency jumps to 117.9 points per 100 possessions. The league-wide average in offensive rating in these situations hovers around 111 points per 100 possessions, while only the Houston Rockets have been better than Westbrook in offensive efficiency after an opponent’s missed field goal over the last two years.

"If Russ is so entirely focused on triple-doubles, then why have there been so many games over the past few seasons where he's nowhere close to reaching the marks?  Does he just not care on some nights?  Does he just suck at his stat-hunting sometimes?  [Try to dismiss the point about his rebounding helping the offense all you want.  It's perfectly legitimate.](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/2/)  If Russ is unwilling to distribute the ball unless he sees a potential assist, then why has he been near the top of the league in hockey assists over the past several seasons?  Did he just luck into that?  People have gone on and on about this theory that he only passes to get assists, or intentionally makes passes late in the shot clock to force assists, but never once has proof been shown of this.  Not once."

"I would be interested in sharing some of my thoughts on Jordan vs. LeBron. However, unlike Russell vs. Chamberlain, this discussion has been very much played out among younger fans, so rather than focusing on ""who was better/greater?"", I wanted to focus some nuances to arguments that fans may not recognize (e.g. the argument for Jordan over LeBron based on X is not as significant as it may seem, but his advantage in Y is even greater than it appears at first glance; conversely, LeBron's advantage in A isn't as impressive, but B actually is). I would want to avoid repeating vapid talking points that really don't add anything substantive (""Jordan went 6-0 in the Finals"", ""LeBron beat a 73-win team"", ""Jordan never teamed with Magic and Larry"").  After having read Ben Taylor's amazing series, I would probably frame the discussion in the context of what he has already laid out (in much greater detail at both the scouting and statistical level than I can possibly imagine), although adding my own thoughts. I think the relative rankings of the two players are less important than recognizing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. I'm not sure what the best format to do so is, since I am reluctant to add a millionth ""Jordan vs. LeBron"" post to this subreddit. I would like to touch upon one issue though, at more length: their different team situations and how it pertains to what Taylor describes as ""ceiling raising"" vs. ""floor raising"".  For what it's worth, I think Jordan was the more impactful player at his peak and the more accomplished one, although that has a lot to do with his fortunes regarding the strengths of his team relative to the rest of the league by the time he was ready to compete. I would also give him an edge in intangibles. LeBron has a significant edge in longevity, and after reviewing Taylor's interesting statistical analysis, I think it is reasonable to argue that if players were assigned to random teams, over the balance of his longer playing career, LeBron would have been expected won more championships than Jordan, even as he continues to add to his career. This is a less results-oriented approach that better adjusts for individual player misfortune, but controversially assumes ""clutchness"" does not exist. (Even if that were to be true, I think it's abundantly clear that some pressure situations are more high leverage than others: Jordan's steal and layup sequence to close out the end of Game 6 in the 1998 Finals meant much more than if he had unleashed it in Game 3 of the same series, which the Bulls won by a 96-54 margin.)  One interesting nuance that was either implied or outright stated in Taylor's articles, which I accept. Jordan was better at lifting a great team to all-time status (""ceiling raising""), whereas LeBron was likely better at lifting an otherwise mediocre roster to strong records (""floor raising""). Part of this has to do with the construction of the roster: Jordan's Bulls featured excellent defenses with solid offensive players and elite offensive rebounding, perfect for a transcendent volume scorer, whereas many of LeBron's teammates were roleplayers who were elite perimeter shooters but limited ball-handlers who were dependent on his shot creating ability. This also reflects their relative strengths, Jordan the better off-ball player (and actually extremely underrated for historically low turnover rates for a player in his role) and LeBron the better passer. That is not to say the two could not flourish if roles were swapped: Jordan famously averaged a near triple-double to conclude the 1989 season when moved to PG, and LeBron used unleashed off-ball cuts and a new propensity for the post to devastating effect in Miami to take advantage of Dwyane Wade's skills as the second ball-handler.  In considering their roles in floor/ceiling-raising, I should note that two differences between Jordan's era and the current era that may be lost on current fans. The first is that offensive possessions (as measured by time spent in possession of the ball or similar metrics) during Jordan's era were not nearly as monopolized by the primary handler as they are with current offenses in a manner not represented by usage rate alone (a metric of shot attempts, turnovers, and box score assits). This is not a phenomenon exclusive to LeBron, but the ball runs through him (and his contemporaries such as Westbrook, Harden, and countless others) much more than it ran through Jordan (and his contemporaries such as even Magic and Bird), and statistics need to be evaluated through that context. The second is that while star players have always tried to exert control over their team rosters, Jordan among the most vocal during his day, players have never wielded as much influence as they do in today's era, partly due to the effects of numerous CBA changes and increasing player salaries paradoxically giving players the financial freedom to actually explore their own values beyond the highest bidder. I mention this because while LeBron's contending teams have never been as stacked relative to other contending teams as Jordan's best teams (1992, 1996, and 1997) were, slightly decreasing his probability of achieving championships in any particular season, but they were incredibly talented in their own right. In fact, his teams were on several occasions selected from all 30 teams for the best championship opportunities, with all young assets and future draft picks hastily tossed aside for short-term considerations to maximize the window of competition under James. (While I despise this strategy from basketball viewership, as someone who has staunchly supported players in labor disputes, I thoroughly applaud James for realizing that his market value far exceeds what he is able to be paid under the CBA and using his leverage accordingly.) I mention this because even though LeBron's team situation may not have been as ideal as Jordan's for winning championships, as a result of the unprecedented control he had over his choice of team and roster situation (no one had ever prompted so many teams to repeatedly clear salary cap space years in advance), it was the best situation for him to repeatedly compete in the Finals, as well as to maximize his box score statistics as well as his on-off stats by ensuring that he would be placed in ball-dominant offenses full of players that can ensure maximal spacing, but who would crumble in his absence (whether due to injury or rest) as their role players were entirely dependent on his shot creation. And of course, when he left these teams, this phenomenon was further exacerbated due to the above factors as well as the exodus of veterans/ring-chasers, the shift towards tanking towards the future, and the absence of young players or draft picks as a result of trades made to improve their championship window during the LeBron tenure. Long story short, because of these factors, it is entirely unfair to criticize LeBron for not matching Jordan's six rings as his team situation was different, but by the same token, that same team situation that he sculpted allowed his statistics and his on-off impact to look much more favorable in comparison."
"&gt;Russell Westbrook is seriously underrated by this board.  Aight you got my attention, let's see your case.  *First sentence*  &gt;This man is on the verge of averaging his 3rd straight triple double for 3 seasons.  GODDAMMIT!!! "
"&gt;Can Russell Westbrook get some love around here  He gets plenty of love. The frustrating thing is, if you’re going to give him love for what he is doing, you absolutely HAVE to accept the way he is going about it.    Triple doubles used to be a rare, special event that happened in a basketball game. That’s because a number or things have to go your way. Your team mates have to hit their shots, you have to have an exceptional night on the boards. Perhaps you work harder than usual, perhaps by chance some boards come your way, perhaps the offence is just clicking, passes become open a lot sooner than usual. Triple doubles have predominantly been built on chance.    The reason some people don’t show Russell Westbrook love is because none of this applies to him. He is not just “happening” on triple doubles. He is playing for them.  He is approaching the game and thinking about this objective, disguised as some ridiculous “I’ll do anything to win” narrative. Some of you don’t want to accept that, but it’s the truth.    The rebounding stat is obvious enough. We all know he chases uncontested rebounds, and some of you even think this is an acceptable offensive strategy because somewhere there is a stat that shows the team score x amount more points per 100 possessions when he grabs the boards.    The more telling part about this is how he handles the ball. Some of you want to praise him for being a “great passer” but are unwilling to accept that he HAS to play a very selfish way to achieve his high assist rate. He only trails Harden in touches per game, and the Thunder are literally dead last in team passing (have been for the last four seasons), because Westbrook is unwilling to distribute the ball unless he sees a potential assist.   Yes, this is absolutely an effective strategy but please do not talk like Westbrook is not doing everything in his power to get these stats. "

I hope Joel Embiid don’t be a bitch about boxing out for Russell Westbrook so the Brodie can get his rebounds for his all star triple double.
"Well if you only look at 20+ PPG seasons, and order them by points per 100 possessions, you get:  1. James Harden, 48.1 Pts/100 (40.3% USG)  2. Michael Jordan, 46.4 (38.3%)  3. Kobe Bryant, 45.6 (38.7%)  4. Russell Westbrook, 44.8 (41.7%)  5. Michael Jordan, 43.6 (34.1%)  6. Michael Jordan, 43.5 (38.6%)  7. Michael Jordan, 43.0 (34.7%)  Regardless of having a high usage rate, you need to be playing at an elite level to net that many Points per 100 Possessions. When someone is the de facto #1 option, the other team is essentially game planning their defensive schemes to stop that one player. Fatigue is a factor as well. To produce this level of scoring with respectable efficiency isn't something to belittle"

I'd treat the media like shit too if I was Russ. He was nice to Kevin Hart cause Kevin Hart is a nice dude and Russ knows it. Simple as that. "
Russell Westbrook will be remembered more highly. 3 straight triple-double seasons.
Steph Curry is listed as the same height as Russell Westbrook (6'3)
"I do think he is the MVP but this is an era of numbers.  Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double for 3 straight seasons.  Scoring is up.   I still think he is MVP because Giannis has a better supporting cast, plays in an easier conference and is a less dominant offensive player - I don't think you can just give it to Harden because of his scoring average."
"You’re wrong, Russell Westbrook owns the title of highest usage rate of all time and usage rate is a metric that was only stated in the 2000s. Of course they are gunna use harden majority of the time this season. When cp3 and capela were, who they gunna use for the second option, Austin rivers? Pj Tucker? Nene? Harden is running this team and winning. Appreciate greatness when it happens. I don’t even like harden at all and definitely like pg and giannis much better, but what this man has been awe-inspiring and nothing short of spectacular. This man is just straight up willing his team to victory night in and night out. "

Man I love Russell Westbrook. OKC you are some lucky fans to have him. I’d love a guy like that on my team.
"Here's the full context from a Q&amp;A. It's a stupid answer to a stupid question:   Guest: “Is George regretting signing on and does he quietly request a trade this off-season?”    I see no evidence of that. He’s continued to play hard, he’s continued to show a bond with Russell Westbrook, he’s fighting through injuries. I sort of like George’s spirit. If he has a trade request, it would surprise me. Heck, seems to me he dodged a bullet. This season hasn’t gone swimmingly for the Thunder. But the Laker deal has been a disaster. PG is fortunate he didn’t end up in Lakerland. "

God I hate Russell Westbrook
"I don't know how much they can do... Or if they should. Like i said, defensively, outside of the 39 point 1st quarter they conceded, i think they had a pretty good game overall. The rest of the game was 74-65 for OKC. The strategy to trap Lillard coming off a screen seems good enough, he just made some absolutely ridiculous shots. And if the defense works, WB can create a feedback loop where he pushes fast and either gets to the rim or creates open looks.   On offense, i should note that PG had a lot of good looks. The stuff they do with him works. He just can't shoot atm and they need it. The best actually working was Russell in transition and Russell/Adams PnR. The best way to deal with Kanter is get him involved as much as possible in that since i don't see the Blazers switching with him to the perimeter. They might as well try to focus on that and hope the role players can make open looks. But who do they even have for that? Should they give minutes to Nabder? 2Pat? Ferguson is probably the best option, he only had 2 attempts from outside and only played 16 minutes. He didn't seem very composed in this particular game.  The one thing i'm sure about: Dennis shouldn't be taking 17 shots. I'd honestly rather have Westbrook take 5 of those possessions."
"Notorious asshole to media.   &gt;“One night, a game ran late,” Curtis writes. “Darnell Mayberry, the Oklahoman’s senior Thunder reporter, was up against deadline. He brought his laptop into the locker room to move quotes directly from the players’ lips to his copy. Mayberry sat in a chair in front of an empty locker. Westbrook saw him and told him the chairs were for players only. “Mayberry got up. But then a funny thing happened. Backup point guard Reggie Jackson took his chair, wheeled it across the locker room, and offered it to Mayberry. Remember that when you wonder why Jackson now plays for the Pistons.”     Read more at: [**https://nesn.com/2015/03/reggie-jacksons-kindness-to-reporter-may-have-miffed-russell-westbrook-in-okc/**](https://nesn.com/2015/03/reggie-jacksons-kindness-to-reporter-may-have-miffed-russell-westbrook-in-okc/)"
"[OKC wanted to trap Lillard and force the ball out of his hands](https://i.imgur.com/cs2ifO6.gifv), the Pelicans special of 2018.

Kanter is limited and can't contain the drive and get back to contest Adams so some help would've been nice.

[Seth Curry displayed the family traits](https://i.imgur.com/wiyFCtA.gifv) and I was curious to see if he'd be key for the bench units but they didn't run that much for him. OKC would probably force some switches to attack him on the other end but there were too many turnovers in the early second to see if that was the plan.  However, despite really good defense up to this point and almost no points from WB/PG, the home team started to have their share of wasted possessions.

Paul George would finally hit a 3 to get OKC to a one point game with 2:30 remaining. [But how do you responde to this?](https://i.imgur.com/THncGXO.gifv) And Kanter's rebounding [was *huge* to ice the game](https://i.imgur.com/mQaDzBQ.gifv). The time it took from the clock for OKC was decisive.  Overall, OKC's strategy wasn't bad IMO. But they failed executing on the first half, Paul George got a huge amount of great looks but can't buy a bucket and they were completely unable to deal with Kanter, which i'd find embarrassing if i was Billy Donovan. They did a good job forcing the guards to pass. Lillard is exceptional and for all the good looks OKC denied him, he was able to make stupid shot after stupid shot, particularly when the game most needed it. But OKC can take some good signs for the series: They won't have such a bad defensive quarter as the 1st that often and Kanter might not be so effective. But they need *someone* to make shots, and if George shoots like this again i don't know how they'll score enough.  Other Notes:    It's impossible to deny PG isn't 100% because of his shoulder but great defensive execution nonetheless throughout. And boy, they need George's shooting desperately. [I can't imagine that he would pass up this mismatch if he was healthy](https://i.imgur.com/TWObkQ9.gifv).  Dennis tries hard but he shouldn't be defending CJ. And his outside shot gets no attention whatsoever so when they play him with another playmaker all it does is clog the offense for others. I really like Jerami Grant (Top 5 MIP). He had his usual dose of effort plays, defense and blocks but when he was meant to create on offense was rough and he couldn't really stop Kanter from getting those boards.  Harkless fouls here but you can see that [once Russ releases the ball, he's completely ignored](https://i.imgur.com/Inqtl13.gifv). His shot gets no respect, and statistically i get it. Once he became more aggressive pushing the ball up, the team's overall production improved as well.  Zach Collins was awful. Just awful."

"Next ""Russell Westbrook"" Question"
Lots of trolls in here angry about Russell Westbrook for no reason.
"I think you're all missing the point. Russell Westbrook got ANOTHER triple double, so..."
"i have seen all the angles.  It's barely a flagrant.  It happens ALL the  time in transition and doesn't get called a flagrant.    We saw russell westbrook literally elbow drop Zaza pachulia like a week ago without punishment.  Andre got EJECTED for something nowhere near that.  We saw a dozen potentially flagrant acts tonight, several from both sides.  This was the least dangerous of all the them.    Also - Giannis is 7' tall.  Falling 2' away is just a shove.  If this was a rebound and someone was pushed from behind for a rebound, it's just a rebounding foul, oh well.  He stopped a dude from scoring.  It was a petty act.  Maybe a flagrant 1.  It wasn't ejection worthy, every single precedent we have says so, including the language in the rule book."
"Lol yeah I mean he passes for assists, hes a dick to the media, he pads stats. Fuck Russell westbrook and his trashcan shooting. Prove me fucking wrong"
"whoah what.  amex32  russell westbrook is in the playoffs tho lmao, that discount was either a huge mistake or a genius move."
You'd think that Russell Westbrook is the only player ever to be criticised by the media the way OKC fans go on about it.
if the thunder get swept it might be time to end the russell westbrook experiment
How is OKC screwed when they have Paul George and Russell Westbrook?  It's not like Golden States gonna last forever. This was a 1 possession game with less than a minute left
"OKC fans are hilarious in here, i’m sure the NBA wants portland to win instead of russell westbrook and paul george"
Will Russell Westbrook ever win a championship?

Uncle Drew 2: starring Russell Westbrook
"If anyone deserves an NBA ring it's Russell Westbrook, he's endured more hardship on and off the court than anyone in the NBA and of his talent."
Russell Westbrook on some Bushwick Bill shit.
There is literally nothing I'd want Russ on my team for more than Dame unless my goal as a team was to let Russell Westbrook put stats up.
Enes Kanter blocked Westbrook.. Russell athleticism advantage officially dead
I thought Russell Westbrook was a ninja turtle lol
"Russell doesn't mention Lillard by name here, but the bit about guys complaining about the All-Star game then getting in seems to only fit Damian. He also takes a broad shot at GSW, but Damian is the only person he actually singled out.      Dame responded to Westbrook's remarks noting that he has a lot of respect for Westbrook and found his comments disappointing. I feel like Lillard is really going to try to go at Russ when they're matched up, I think people are underselling this series and I hope it's as good as my imagination is convincing me that it will be."
Kd “Russell Westbrook sends his regards”
"You clearly aren't a true raptors fan.   Vanvleet hit two shots and he was -16 by the third, -20 at the end of the game. The fucking fact everyone is stating how FVV can't run the offense you should reconsider your flair.   I use to think Russell Westbrook was a statpadder and chucker but I can understand the value he brings to the city. It goes the same way for Lowry, it's ride or die. **We would not be in this position without him** and fake ass fans like you is the reason why players aren't loyal. It's one fucking game out of possible 7. I'm more than confident we will still end up in the finals until then you can stop lying about being a raptors fan."
Alright no it’s not and you’re actually an idiot for thinking it clearly is. We’re comparing Kevin Durant to Russell Westbrook having his worst year in a long time. Paul George is having a near-MVP level season and you guys are the fucking 8th seed so explain to me how Russell Westbrook is so clearly more important than KD?
"There's another longboy on the Magic who's even longer. 7'1 with 7'10 wingspan, ran the 3/4 court sprint as fast as Russell Westbrook, and he's got HOOOOOOESSSSS."
Comparable combine/predraft athletic metrics to Russell Westbrook
"The part that makes this move feel even weaker though is that he could have won in OKC, they were up 3-1 against the 73 win Warriors, he’s had a strong supporting cast every year (apart from his first few seasons). Heck, Russell Westbrook and James Harden both went on to become league MVPs, and Ibaka was extremely good too.   People try to equate this with Lebron’s move, but Lebron played with Mo Williams, Anthony Parker, Antawn Jamison and big Z, it really was questionable whether the Cavs could field a winning team. KD’s legacy would’ve been so much better if he stuck it out beat the Warriors the next year, or even beat the Cavs in the finals."

Russell Westbrook is the coolest NBA dude who doesn't play for the Memphis Grizzlies and isn't named Marc Gasol. Anyone who wears the stuff he wears with that kind of confidence can have my love.
Sounds like a perfect player to pair with Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook must feel conflicted right now
Russell Westbrook doesn't have one either
Tell me how you feel about Russell Westbrook.

"Kevin Durant surrendered the chance to possibly claim more MVPs and scoring titles in order to be better positioned for championships. He swapped out nearly a decade of goodwill from rabid supporters in exchange for a deluge of venom. And he gave up the aw-shucks charm of relatively quiet anonymity for round-the-clock, nitpicking scrutiny. But ask him if being a member of the Golden State Warriors has been all that he thought it would, and Durant responds without hesitation.  “Of course,” Durant said in a recent conversation with The Athletic.  Durant’s alliance with the Warriors has been mutually beneficial, and neither side should be upset if these playoffs turn out to be the end of their dynastic run together. The two championship rings and Finals MVPs are what was expected when Durant posted a picture of himself, arms folded, in that sleeveless T-shirt, and declared on The Players’ Tribune that the rest of the NBA would be playing for second place until further notice. That success has come with some stress — some from the outside, some self-inflicted — but this experience has been rewarding nonetheless.  “I came here knowing for a fact, that every media member, every fan was going to call me every name in the book for however long I was here and I was going to take the brunt of everything. I knew coming here,” Durant said. “But I wanted to be a part of this so bad, I didn’t give a fuck. Same with LeBron. He took all of that heat, no matter what.”  In three seasons in Oakland, Durant has learned to move better without the ball and developed the kind of ball-handling needed to consistently make plays for others and get any shot, from anywhere he wants. His shot remains a lethal weapon, but he can be more discretionary surrounded by more offensive threats.  Oklahoma City ran a perfunctory, facile offense that only popped because of the explosiveness and unpredictability of Durant and Russell Westbrook. The Warriors have been a graduate school education for Durant, forcing him to improve not only as a player but also as a teammate capable of sharing and ceding the spotlight as the situation warrants.  “I enjoy the way they played basketball. I never played with shooters like that. That moved. That were versatile players. I wanted to be a part of that,” Durant said. “My game was talking to me. Not that other shit. The spirit of the game was talking to me. Not the spotlight or the fame that comes from being the best player. Not the legacy. I swear on my life, that don’t mean nothing to me. How I build myself up in this NBA life, it doesn’t mean anything to me. I just want to play great basketball every second I’m on the court, and that was a perfect opportunity for me to do so.”  What Durant doesn’t possess are the kind of mind-blowing, get-on-my-back performances that players on teams with inferior individual talents ride into the record books and MVP conversations. His former Thunder teammate and reigning MVP James Harden just completed the greatest offensive season since Michael Jordan was demolishing scoreboards three decades ago.  Harden is about to finish no worse than second in MVP voting for the fourth consecutive season. Though he hasn’t finished higher than seventh since joining the Warriors — and is unlikely to finish much higher this season — Durant said he isn’t envious of the recognition other players are receiving. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Paul George could bump him from first-team all-NBA, an honor that, surprisingly, he has claimed only once since his MVP year in 2014.  “I watched James and I see what he’s doing and I admire what he’s doing and I appreciate what he’s doing,” Durant said. “Before, I would’ve been, ‘Fuck, I wish that was me.’ But now, I can appreciate the game even more because I’m so secure with my game. I don’t have to go out there and shoot every time for people to recognize me. I’m cool with it, you know what I’m saying?”  The Warriors are again favorites to win it all, with the addition of a playoff-starved DeMarcus Cousins tipping the odds even more in their favor. Becoming the first team since Bill Russell’s Celtics to win at least four in five years is the motivation, since the Warriors have proven most all other points. But this season has been a challenge unlike any other for an organization that has been blamed for ruining competitive balance.  Boredom and maintaining good health aren’t the only obstacles impeding the opportunity to make history. With Durant, Cousins and Klay Thompson set to become free agents this summer, and Draymond Green facing the same situation next year, the sense that this is the last dance for this dominance has resonated throughout the league, providing hope that the Larry O’Brien trophy won’t just set up permanent residency in the Bay Area.  This summer, Durant is set to make another seismic decision that could alter the landscape of the league for years to come.  From majority owner Joe Lacob on down, the Warriors haven’t let Durant’s future, and the constant rumblings surrounding it, disrupt what they’ve set out to accomplish. The competition has improved this postseason, and the rest of the league has caught up to a style of play that sent shockwaves throughout the league once Steve Kerr took over as head coach. But the Warriors still have the edge in talent, with a starting lineup of five all-stars, including two MVPs. After winning his first title, Durant recognized that it didn’t automatically fulfill him, mend any fractured relationships in his personal life or remove any worry; winning merely validated his dedication to the craft. That realization has resulted in some dourness and complicated his relationships with a team, a franchise, that has made joy so much a part of the equation. He’s had fun but is still searching.  This season has provided some displeasing moments — the Draymond Green public spat against the Warriors’ first-round playoff opponent that needed to be hashed out, privately over a bottle of wine; and rumors about Durant heading to the New York Knicks that reached a crescendo after a cap-clearing deal at the trade deadline. Having to address those situations has been annoying and caused him to lash out in response.  Given the scorn he endured for leaving Oklahoma City, and the perception among some bitter fans that he wasn’t fully committed in his final season with the Thunder, Durant is sensitive to any suggestion that he isn’t all-in for right now. His game is talking, commitment resonating with each slashing dunk or pull-up, foul-line jumper. But everyone seems to be listening to everything else.  If he could control the narrative, Durant would want the focus to be on how much he has evolved as a player with the Warriors, how he has become more efficient and engaged as a playmaker and defender. His versatility and dynamic skill set are unique for a player his size. And with LeBron James unable to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to the playoffs, a few more have reluctantly conceded that he is now the best player in the game. A rare superstar without a legion of diehard Stans, Durant knows what he believes but won’t waste his energy trying to make the argument for others.  “Comparison is a need for joy,” Durant said. “It takes a long time for you to realize that as an NBA player, especially when you’ve been pumped up, as soon as you come into it, you’re promoted a star. You always want to compare yourself to the next guy or the guy that did it before, the MJs, the Kobes, the LeBrons, to rookies. I want to compare myself to my teammates. When you compare yourself at all times to see what guys are doing, you’re taking away from the focus of trying to make yourself the greatest that you can be.”  Wherever Durant decides to play next season, that team will get a player who is undeniably better than when he arrived in Golden State. The Warriors remain optimistic that the appeal of becoming something historically great and moving into a sleek, new arena in San Francisco will persuade him to stay. They don’t need to make much of a recruiting pitch because they’ve provided the results and winning culture that he sought.  Although his accomplishments have been discounted by some because the Warriors remain Stephen Curry’s team, Durant understands that leaving the Warriors’ best potential rival, the Thunder, removed the lone impediment to Golden State’s dreams of domination. Durant’s decision to add some duper to an organically built super team topped what James did by teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami. It also denied James the opportunity to make more than one ring in Cleveland part of his legacy.  Having has spent much of his career in pursuit of James, using his success as a barometer for what he needs to accomplish, Durant now has a chance to tie him in championships and capture the three-peat that would put him in select company alongside Russell and Jordan. He’s in that position because he’s endured the storm, all for chasing what had eluded him in previous places.  “I’m from Washington, D.C. I went to Oklahoma City for eight years. Out of nowhere, I went to the Bay for three years,” Durant said. “I’ve been roaming my whole life. I never had no stable environment. Ever. Ever. Since I woke up. I sacrificed a lot of shit to be here and to change my game up to be with these guys. And it was worth it.”"
"Also I think there would have been such a balanced NBA the last two years.... GSW, OKC, HOU, CLE all vying for the title.  Instead it's just been boring af since KD had FOMO.  It's not like when LeBron left a pretty fucking awful CLE team in 2010 that literally had a one year from retirement Zydrunus and Mo Williams.  KD had Russell Westbrook, Steven Adams, and would have been adding Vic to that mix.  The NBA has been trash ever since he went to GSW.  Those last two GSW titles will always have an asterisks from those of us that lived it."

"It's totally nuts, but completely accurate anyways.  [Here's a Bref comparison to the top five](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id2_select=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=antetgi01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id3_select=James+Harden&amp;y3=2019&amp;player_id3=hardeja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id4_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y4=2019&amp;player_id4=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id5_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id5_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y5=2019&amp;player_id5=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id6_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id6_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y6=2019&amp;player_id6=westbru01&amp;idx=players)  I think the main thing is Westbrook is by FAR the worst shooter of that group of six.  TS% of .64, .64, .63, .61, .59 for the top five and .50 for Westy.  He's only shooting 43% overall.  I'm not saying this makes him bad, but it does mean he's not in the god-tier.  Everyone in the top five is putting up more points AND much better efficiency than Russell.  Add to the fact that I don't think his rebounding is as impressive as it looks (most DRBs in general are 'replaceable' by other players and especially in his case) and it's pretty solid.  An interesting point to note is that he's noticeably declined since his insane MVP year.  Actually quite a lot I think.  His usage was 41% that year (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) with a TS of 55%...  which is hard to even process.  With Paul George joining the team he's now only using 30% of possessions, but rather than getting more efficient he's declined to 50% TS%.  Crazy but true."
"Russell Westbrook is the least athletic point guard in the league, fyi"
"&gt;For years, we didn't have enough data to even try to quantitatively value individual defensive performances. In turn, even the most sophisticated MVP debates -- Giannis vs. Harden, Russell Westbrook vs. Kawhi Leonard, you name it -- can overlook the unglamorous arts of stopping dudes.  Ah yes, that insane Westbrook vs Leonard MVP race."

It's pretty clear that the issue is, Draymond is not a scorer. He's a really shitty scorer. It's like he stopped being able to score anything well, aside from some pretty easy layups they get him. Just a few years ago, he could get to the basket and he was making 40% on the threes. I admit it is a big thing. Even the nicest player would have a reputation in the internet if he was scoring so shittily."
"First point you make: Russell Westbrook leads the league, by a significant margin, in assists, potential assists, and pass to assist %.   His pass to assist % is much higher than Dame’s even though he makes many more passes per game. That means he’s a much more efficient passer at a much higher volume. This is akin to a player making more threes at a higher percentage than another player. In other words, a lot of Dame’s passes don’t lead to anything. And no, this does not mean he’s indirectly setting his teammates up: he only averages 0.8 secondary assists per game.   Third point: Dame’s A/TO: 2.55. Russ’s A/TO: 2.37.  That’s a difference of .18 (not “significantly better”, as you claim) while Russ is providing 3.8 more assists per game.    Diverse passing skill-set? This is the most subjective claim you make but buddy all you have to do is watch some OKC games to see how many different ways Russ can set his teammates up.    And lastly... Westbrook has now put up four straight seasons with double digit assists, leading the league twice in that span. Until Dame can increase the volume of his passing while also increasing the efficiency of them, he will not be a top tier passer in the league."
"Okay buddy, make your argument then. How is Damian Lillard a better passer than Russell Westbrook."
He’s a better Russell Westbrook? So he’s a better passer and he’s more athletic and explosive? Not to mention he’s a better defender and rebounder?   Their play styles aren’t even remotely similar and your comment shows that you don’t actually watch basketball.
"Russell Westbrook doesn't get the credit he deserves for what he does. Paul George stay in OKC because he liked playing with him, don't think the fact that is not beneficent at times bug him  and he's the one playing with him night in, night out."
"LOL. I’m sorry no offense but statements like that show you don’t really know how important russ is to our offense. we the past few years have been absolutely stagnant without him. Regardless of if he’s shooting well or not he makes the offense go with his playmaking, schroder cannot get close to that. I don’t think we would win without russ, if Steph Curry makes the warriors offense go, Russell Westbrook makes our offense do the same(not as high level obviously but the drop off has been tremendous)."
So we’re just gonna act like Quinn cook and Russell Westbrook play the same roles for their team
"Chris Paul has a higher TO% this year than Harden. It's just with a usage rate of 40.5%, Harden will have more turnovers than just about any other player even though it's just a 14.5% turnover percentage. Out of the whole league, only Westbrook, Trae Young, and D'Angelo Russell have a higher assist % than Harden's 39.5%."
"My man, Westbrook is still a great player. I don't know why some Thunder fans feel like they need to pretend like he doesn't have a hole in his game. For instance, Damian is shockingly inconsistent finisher at the rim and still has a tendency to die on screens. I don't need to pretend those things aren't true. Because even with that he's still amazing. Same shit for Russell. He's a shockingly inefficient scorer. He's still a baller."
"03/04: lost in the first round to the Kings 4-1. Averaged 27pts per game on .485 eFG% while grabbing 12 boards.   06/07: lost in the first round to the Warriors 4-2. Averaged 20pts per game on .404 eFG% while grabbing 11 boards. Poor series by Dirk.   07/08: lost in the first round to the Hornets 4-1. Averaged 27pts per game on .505 eFG% while grabbing 12 boards.   09/10: lost in the first round to the Spurs 4-2. Averaged 27pts per game on .566(!!) eFG% while grabbing 8 boards.   Russell Westbrook: never finished a playoff season with higher than .460 eFG%, even in seasons where OKC went past the first round. Dirk did that 11 times. Westbrook has only once shot better than 36% from 3 during the playoffs, and that was in 09/10 when he attempted 2 per game."
"Russell Westbrook has the greatest ""motor"" and stamina of all time.  I still think he is a stat padder...but there is no one else in the nba that can statpad like him. No one else cant consistently play at full speed. There's a reason why no one else in the nba has averaged a triple double since oscar."
1. Vince Carter 2. Russell Westbrook 3. LeBron James 4. Blake Griffin 5. Reggie Miller
That is false the thunder still had Russell westbrook Ibaka and Steven Adams and they just acquired Oladipo before KD left. Also the next year the thunder was still a playoff team the next year with the 6th seed. Lebron's best teammate was mo Williams when he left and the year after he left they became the worst team in the NBA stop trying rewrite history

Russell Westbrook had never missed a basketball game before in his *life* before Patrick Beverley took out his knee.
&gt;  he doesn’t have that hunger for winning  Now I've heard it all. Russell Westbrook doesn't have that hunger for winning. OK man
"WS/48 tends to favor players in positive situations that have a lower usage rate. E.g. Dwight Powell finished the season with the 8th highest but I don't think anyone would consider him even a top 50 player in the league.  PER is harder to inflate, but can still favor players on a lower usage rate. Westbrook was also only a few points away from finishing top ten.  BPM tends to be the most consistent metric that I agree with for who the best players in the league are or who had the most impact on their team, which Westbrook ranked 8th and lead the league in his MVP year.  Just looking at the BPM top ten I feel like that's a solid representation of most important players  to their teams throughout the year:      1.	James Harden • HOU			11.7     2.	Giannis Antetokounmpo • MIL	10.8     3.	Nikola Jokic • DEN			9.5     4.	Anthony Davis • NOP			8.5     5.	LeBron James • LAL			8.1     6.	Rudy Gobert • UTA				7.0     7.	Karl-Anthony Towns • MIN		6.8     8.	Russell Westbrook • OKC		6.5     9.	Kyrie Irving • BOS			6.4     10.	Nikola Vucevic • ORL			6.4"
"The better team healthy is definitely debatable. Technically OKC hasn't even been fully healthy all year either with roberson out + russ and PG missed time. Nurkic has more of an impact than roberson and that's not even an argument tho. I still think the trailblazers are criminally underrated so i won't even be mad if yall beat us, but everyone sleeps on my mans roberson.   Article from last year: ""For starters, there’s this: Oklahoma City’s starters (Russell Westbrook, George, Anthony, Steven Adams) are +14.8 this season per 100 possessions in net rating with Roberson on the floor. They are +1.8 without him. It is a devastating differential. The Thunder were fifth in defensive rating (points allowed per 100 possessions) going into the game Roberson was injured. Since then? They rank 17th."""
"And my problem is people looking at stats and not watching the games. He was the only reason we didn't lose every game in that series by 15+ points. Everyone besides him and bizarro Roberson was fucking dreadful offensively and made huge costly mistakes.    I don't deny he was bad in some of those 4th quarters, but he was gassed from playing unbelievably well in the first 3. If you are looking to point blame at anyone on OKC for losing that Rockets series, Russell Westbrook should literally be the last person on your list."
"The problem with Russ is that it’s always about him, he doesn’t have that hunger for winning. It seems like he cares more about stat padding than actually winning. Every time I watch a okc game it’s like instead of playing good basketball his teammates box everyone out and make a circle for Russell to get rebounds then when teammate takes rebound he starts getting pouty. OKC should’ve kept KD or Harden, Westbrook could play with 4 steph curries and still chuck a 40 foot 3ptrr with 12 seconds left on clock down by 1 with 3 guys on him.  Good for him for triple treble but I would be more impressed if he put as much care into winning as he does as dressing badly and getting his teammmates to pad stats all year"
"Eh, in a playoff series not having capable shooters is a death sentence, and that's exactly what's going to kill OKC. Who's going to shoot the ball at a decent percentage for OKC this series? What good is Russell Westbrook scoring 40 if it takes 40 shots?  Portland, by design, always lets Westbrook go off and take as many shots as he wants. He can't resist, and it'll cost them a 2nd round berth."
2008:    Derrick Rose   Russell Westbrook   Kevin Love
"Yeah the hype dies down as months go on. I remember the year Russell Westbrook won it over James Harden, all the people that were so hyped about it in early April, a lot of that anticipation died down. It’s honestly an overkill stretching it out that far. We want to see the MVP be challenged by others stars in the playoffs."
You think they’re gonna be better than a team with Russell Westbrook and Paul George?
"Nah, more likely ""My mistake was believing in Russell Westbrook, a guy with no jump shot and no basketball IQ. Paul George made a huge mistaken signing with the Thunder. It's just like real estate/my divorce..."""
Kevin Durant Lebron James Giannis Antetokoumnpo  Russell Westbrook Paul George Kawhi Leonard Anthony Davis Curry Harden  Kyrie Jokic Damian Lillard  Are you really taking Gobert over any of these guys? Maybe I wrote my argument wrong but the point still stands. If you're rebuilding your team are you taking him over these people? Gobert to me is a really good piece you add to an already- good team
"I mean that's why I said maybe.  You guys have Russell Westbrook and Paul George, you were supposed to be good.  Everyone picked us to not make the playoffs like always.  Our series were worse but your expectations were higher imo."

Enjoy seeing him not play defense and getting back doored more than Lisa Ann on NBA All Star Weekend.  Thunder: Helen Keller could probably out shoot Russ and if not she damn sure has better shot selection. It's like watching your dad get drunk and ruin a family reunion, you hate watching it, but he's *our* dad so we have to love him.  Brooklyn: I love Kurucs. Also, your fans will expect more next year and you'll fail to improve and then all we'll hear about is how this years team over achieved. Believe me, I've been there.  Lakers: I had a good burn for you guys but you didn't even show up to the party. You're the only nba franchise that is the 2nd best team in their own building.  Pistons: Not sure how you guys even made it to the playoffs. Must be something in the water.   Boston: Your city has the worst street system in existence. I've seen meth labs with more organization. They were next door to my house.  Toronto: Kawhi will leave you next season because Toronto weather sucks and I say that with a tornado outside my front door. Also your last season was ended by a handful of turn around jumpers.  Clippers: You should start Keanu Reeves at point guard because your team is full of replacement players.   Nuggets: *Playoffs (noun): a series of contests played after the end of the regular season to determine a championship.*  Just thought you guys should know what you're in for since no one on your team has ever been before.  Pacers: I'm genuinely confused as to how you guys made it here. But then I remembered that basketball is all there is to do in Indiana  Philly: I can't wait to see Joel Embiid talk trash to someone (in broken english) on the Nets and then sit quietly on the bench like a scolded child when they lose. I'd like to make fun of Ben Simmons' lack of a jump shot but my team starts Russell Westbrook.   Spurs: Your best player is a 70 year old man named Greg. You shoot more midrange shots than a 90s lottery team. At least Demar and Lamarcus made 5th team all nba this year.  Magic: You've touched more Congolese children's lives than the local war lords could ever dream of, Bismack thanks you. On a less serious note: I can't name 5 players on your team outside of Aaron Judge and I doubt your fans could either.  Warriors: Everyone hates you but you're truly one of the best teams ever assembled. Too bad the closest your true fans will ever get to see you play live is through Hulu. Your cities real estate prices are higher than the odds of Draymond kicking someone in the dick and complaining. Your best player doesn't know he's the best player, your 2nd best player doesn't know which burner account he's currently logged into. Your 3rd best player doesn't know who he plays for and your 4th best player doesn't know if his leg will make it through the playoffs.**"
"It’s ok but it’s not “real deal” in most people’s eyes. If giannis, LeBron, Steph, kawhi, KD, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, or Anthony Davis puts up that stat line it would be considered really weird, but it *feels* like jokic falls short like that kind of often. I love jokic and I’m very aware that most ones when one stat is lacking, the rest are usually there. But he just doesn’t have the consistency, in my opinion, that the other elites in the league do."
nah man hes happy without a ring    And lets not act like Dame wants this shit more than russell westbrook.

And the final seconds of Oklahoma City's hard-fought 123-114 victory featured Westbrook walking up court while talking in Lillard's ear, a talk punctuated by a spirited pat on Lillard's butt.   'Respect,' Lillard said of the interaction in the final seconds."""

Why is it weird to discuss Russell Westbrook when he literally played just last night and had a memorable game?
Rent free? Is it weird to be thinking about the closest series in the first round where Russell Westbrook is one of the main stars?
He did guard him game 1 and 2. You think Russell Westbrook asked the coaching staff to change assignments? I think youre the one being naive

"&gt; SO, Sam Presti's obsession with a big 7-foot traditional center goes all the way back to 2009 when he traded for Tyson Chandler.   Tyson was arguably the second most important player in the 2011 DAL team that won a ring.  &gt;Then in 2011, he traded for Kendrick Perkins --- and before Perkins even played a single minute (!!!!!) for the Oklahoma City Thunder, Presti signed him to a 36 million/4 year contract.  This was during an era where OKC still need to go through Duncan, LAL's big men, and Dwight possibly. Kendrick was a valuable asset during his time there.  &gt;This was an incredibly short-sighted move that was looked at with a lot of skepticism  Short sighted moves are the types of moves you make when you're close to winning a ring. This has been the strategy for most teams who won or were just there. And honestly, there's no need for Presti to try and have some contingency plan. They had KD and Russ who were young. Any moves, no matter how bold, is not mortgaging their future. That's the beauty of KD and Russ. You can stay young and be in a win-now mode.  &gt; around the league at the time, that in-directly led to the Harden trade ([some more info](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1389202-why-kendrick-perkins-contract-forced-okc-thunder-to-trade-james-harden)). Now, Harden was traded for one and one sole reason only -- the OKC Thunder owners did not want to go over the luxury tax line this early into their ownership. But the only reason this problem arose is because, Harden was 5th in Sam Presti's priority order of whom to pay. It was Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins and then James Harden. Sam Presti didn't account for James Harden when writing up the bill. In all honesty, I think Presti *assumed* without asking, that Harden would be okay with taking whatever they offered him. Harden obviously said he wasn't taking less, and again, without so much as giving it a second thought, Presti immediately looked to move Harden. Despite having just signed Perkins to that massive extension, Presti's first thought was, ""I'm going to trade Harden for another 7-foot center"".   &gt;   &gt;In summer 2012, Presti offered Harden in a trade centered around Jonas Valancunis to the Toronto Raptors, but Raptors GM at the time, Bryan Colangelo, declined ([here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1610472-james-harden-could-have-been-a-raptor-would-you-have-pulled-the-trigger)).   &gt;   &gt;Harden wasn't even hitting restricted free agency for a whole year, but Presti for some reason was impatient and desperately wanted to move him on, despite Harden having played the third most important role in the team getting to the NBA Finals just a couple months back. In the end, he was traded to Houston and the rest as they say is history.  Hindsight is 20-20. Of course it looks bad that Harden is an MVP and OKC is no longer the juggernaut it was. But think of it this way, I think it was fairly obvious Harden was too good be the 3rd best player on a team. He was likely gonna wanna leave anyways and it was okay to part ways because they knew they had 2 superstars in KD and Russ. And even if he stayed, you're spending all your money on perimeter players with the Russ and Harden needing the ball in their hand to be worth you're paying them.   Idk where you got the idea that Presit can just pay Harden whatever and he'd be fine with it. That just seems like all mindless speculation.  &gt;Now, OKC obviously got the draft picks in the trade for Harden. And guess who Sam Presti wanted to draft with the highest pick available? Yep, you guessed it, a 7-foot center. Steven Adams was drafted with the 12th pick in the 2013 draft, with Perkins obviously still on the roster (sidenote - Giannis was drafted with the 14th pick).  Steven Adams was a good pick up and was valuable in their playoff runs. And they got Kevin Martin who did a decent job of filling in what Harden was doing as the sixth main. And also Jeremy Lamb. He's nothing to rave about but there was a lot of upside to him at the time of trade. You complain about being Presti short-sighted but this trade was picking up young guys.  &gt;In February 2015, Presti finally hesitantly decided to trade Perkins, and it cost OKC a first round pick. But guess what OKC got in return? Yep, right again, yet another traditional 7-foot center, Enes Kanter. Now, here's where the real craziness with the money begins. In summer 2015, Kanter hit restricted free agency, and OKC matched a 70 million/4 year offer sheet for Kanter. This made absolutely no sense whatsoever. OKC had to pay KD soon, Westbrook soon. Hell, Kanter wasn't even the team's starting center (!!!) Adams was, and he had to be paid soon too. But Presti couldn't resist, he simply had to pay him.  Kanter was giving them an inside presence. He was fine during his stint. Overypaying people is something you just have to live with when you wanna win. The best teams always have a huge payroll.  You're mainly complaining that OKC has been focusing on big men rather than Harden. TBH, they had enough talent on the perimeter where they didn't necessarily need Harden. **And going big and long is a strategy that almost got them rings, probably a higher chance of winning than sticking with Harden in my opinion.**  &gt;But imo, from the beginning to the end, the main reason why the Thunder have come all the way from a team that drafted 3 all-time great talents to what they are today, is down to Presti's adamancy of continually wanting that traditional 7-foot big and prioritizing and premeditating the needs of a team built around that type of center, over what the team ALREADY had -- 3 MVPs, then 2 MVPs, now 1.  Realistically, they had zero chance of retaining 3 MVPs. One of them was bound to leave and letting Harden go was probably the right decision. And they did a pretty good job at setting up a team that's worthy of retaining 2 MVPs. KD leaving was just so unpredictable."
Russell Westbrook was reffing the game and opponents bantering was an affront to him
"I'm not sure where else to post this. I just had an incredibly detailed, vivid dream last night about Russell Westbrook rock climbing with me and my friends at our gym. We didn't even get pictures, just wanted to share with him our hobby. He shared with us some of his own advice from basketball while we showed him a sport that's all about personal achievement. It was nice. I slept through a meeting."
"oh wow, Markief Morris, Jerami Grant, and other no names are shooting as bad as the MVP, all-star, #1 option, Russell Westbrook and it's all their fault!!!! WOW!! I never thought of it that way!! you sound stupid, please shut up."
Donald Trump Russell Westbrook 🤝Hat Propaganda
Russell Westbrook is Ben Simmons if Ben Simmons shot 8 threes a game and didn't play defense
"Guys **below** Westbrook in RPM this season: Drummond, Dipo, Donovan Mitchell, Clint Capela, Khris Middleton, Dangelo Russell, DeAaron Fox, Myles Turner, Ben Simmons, Bradley Beal, Luka Doncic, CJ McCollum, DeMar Derozan, Devin Booker.   Can we stop acting like having Westbrook on your team is a bad thing please?"
"Why the fuck would Dudley poke the bear? The best thing would be if Simmons just sort of coasted through, going through the motions. You saw his response to the boos in G2, so you give him another reason to put in that Russell Westbrook effort in G3.   He’s supposed to be their savvy vet, and he instead inspired the opposition’s second best player in a game the best player missed."
"It’s funny to me that people say this. His jumper isn’t bad, it’s just not good enough so he is being efficient. Unlike Russell Westbrook who shoots 20% from three and takes 5 threes per game.... I mean can you imagine if Ben Simmons took 5 extra shots per game and only scored 2 extra points??? That’d be extremely inefficient (and yet he’s still be more efficient than Westbrook lol)"
What I'm getting from this is that he's Russell Westbrook with a 3 point shot

"honestly i agree with the first part. i never really hated on his move to the warriors or thought it was weak or whatever. it definitely wasn't the ""noble"" move or courageous or anything in the slightest. but the whole snake thing imo is kinda childish, i mean i get it for like the first year maybe but to hold a grudge for as long as some of the people on this sub have always seemed weird. the guy was playing with russell westbrook for a long time and wanted to put himself in the best possible basketball situation.  the issue i have with the warriors is that they dog it on most nights. they don't always make the right decision. they don't always play hard. draymond is one of my favorite players ever but he doesn't really even play in the regular season. kd proved tonight he could play way better than he has even in the playoffs. steph and klay really are the only ones who consistently put in the effort. if youre gonna be a superteam - be a superteam. the 73 win season was fucking amazing cause they actually cared the entire year. i forgot who wrote the article but basically they said the warriors losing 3-1 in the finals ruined the excitement that team created not because they gained KD from it but because it made them scared to go all out in the regular season. like yes, we still get the occasional amazing curry/klay games but its just not the same"

"&gt;Up walks Russell Westbrook and one of the girls from the UCLA women's team,  probably his wife"
"I have a few problems with some of the statement made here.  First:  &gt;  Despite having just signed Perkins to that massive extension, Presti's first thought was, ""I'm going to trade Harden for another 7-foot center"". In summer 2012, Presti offered Harden in a trade centered around Jonas Valancunis to the Toronto Raptors, but Raptors GM at the time, Bryan Colangelo, declined  Yes, it was reported that Presti offered a trade for Harden centered around Valanciunis, but there were also reports that Presti tried to make trades with both Washington centered around Beal, and Golden State centered around Klay Thompson. You can't say that Presti's ""first thought"" was to try to trade Harden for a center.    Second:  &gt; But the only reason this problem arose is because, Harden was 5th in Sam Presti's priority order of whom to pay. It was Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins and then James Harden. Sam Presti didn't account for James Harden when writing up the bill. In all honesty, I think Presti assumed without asking, that Harden would be okay with taking whatever they offered him.  You're comparing a contract extension made in 2011 to Perkins to the contract negotiations 1 year later. You can't state it as a fact that Presti didn't consider Harden when signing a contract extension with Perkins. This was prior to Harden's 6MOTY season. I understand what you're trying to get at here, but the way you state this as fact is misleading.   Third:   &gt; Had Presti simply waited for Adams to hit restricted free agency in 2017, he could've signed him to a much cheaper deal.   There is no way of knowing what offers Adams would have gotten in free agency, so you can't state something like that as a fact.  Fourth:  &gt; In summer 2015, Kanter hit restricted free agency, and OKC matched a 70 million/4 year offer sheet for Kanter. This made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  This move did make sense at the time. Kanter was OKC's best bench scorer that next year, when OKC went on to make their deepest run in the postseason since going to the Finals in 2012. They beat a very good Spurs team in the second round, and Kanter was a big contributor in that series. This was OKC's best shot at a title, so why complain about them spending money to keep their good bench players? KD was approaching free agency, and almost everyone would agree that OKC's priority at that time was contending for a championship, which was their best shot at keeping KD.  In that context, paying Kanter did make sense."
"Its not ridiculous, its a comparison and you just saying a point guard who's  a great rebounder doesn't  help the team shows no knowledge on your part. Magic played the same position as Russell, so what does the height difference matter? It doesn't. Barkley was no more than 6'5 and he's  one of the game's  all time rebounders, and yes i know he played the 4, that's power forward if you don't know. He was about an inch taller than Westbrook, so please don't use height when you think it benefits you and dismiss it when you don't. Cause really nothing your saying benefits you. Ben Wallace was a 6'8 center and he led the league in boards. I could go on and list all the guards who were great rebounders, but i won't. What i will tell you is when they were doing their thing, no one thought their rebounding skills didn't matter. Like I said, obvious you never played the game! If we could get this shot on inside, Charles and Kenny would tell you exactly what I am. Where did you come up with this idea that a guard who is great at crashing the boards is irrelevant? In your upside down wrong world of the NBA, only centers and forwards get boards?  's"
"Maybe... I don't know.... play defense?  Stop chucking 3s like you're Steph Curry?  He's the point guard.  A point guard has more responsibilities than just scoring and passing the ball.  It's his JOB to get other players into rhythm, to get them not just good shots but consistent touches so they feel like they're in the offensive flow.  Ever wonder why the players who play with Russ always shoot worse when they're on the Thunder, go somewhere else and their FG and eFG jumps?  It's simple.  Russ dominates the ball.  Entirely.  Completely.  If he's on the court and the Thunder have the ball he's likely going to use 18 seconds of most possessions.  It doesn't work, and if you've played decent ball at any level, you know how difficult it is to drain a shot, even if you're wide open, if you haven't seen a touch in 8-10 minutes of gametime.  Not shots.  Touches.  Basketball is a rhythm game -- if it wasn't vitally important you wouldn't see teams taking shots for 30 minutes prior to the start of every game.  This is compounded when -- as has been documented by espn/538/etc -- a player receives the ball with under 3 seconds left.  Cold hands clang rims.  Anyway.  Russ's job isn't to get assists.  Russ's job is to ensure *the offense flows well*.  That's why great PGs know how to keep their guys engaged.  They know how to lead and how to keep their teammates in the game.   https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/20/15370190/russell-westbrook-fourth-quarter-shooting-thunder-vs-rockets-game-2-playoffs  Imagine being McBuckets here (who, by the way, IS a good shooter).  Westbrook takes 3-4 shots when you're WIDE open.  Is he going to actually pass to you on the 5th change?  The 6th?  The other team is leaving you wide open.  Meanwhile you haven't touched the ball for an entire quarter and you don't know if you're going to even get a shot off again.  Russ is supposed to, you know, LEAD his team.  That doesn't mean vacuuming up every stat he can.  That doesn't mean waiting until he's doubled with 4 seconds on the shot clock to pass.  It doesn't mean flatly ignoring Paul George like last night, who started the game 9-14 and promptly didn't see the ball again until the game was getting out of hand.  And it CERTAINLY doesn't mean letting a rookie guard denotate for 71 points in the final two losses of the series.  It's weird.  Russ has this giant motor that allows him to go up for virtually every rebound in the game -- yet he doesn't seem to have any energy to expend when it comes to staying in front of his man or switching off on defense, or closing out on a three -- which by the way, he did the latter at a *historically* low rate for a guard last year.  He was the 3rd lowest in 3 point contests among all qualifying, behind two CENTERS.  Think about the worst defender you know in the league that gets minutes.  Westbrook, without fail, contests fewer shots than he does.  Guards last season shot 4-6% higher against WB than they averaged for the season."
"Russell Westbrook has literally not been an efficient player in the playoffs since 2010 when the Thunder lost in 6 to the Lakers.  I'm willing to give a pass for 2017 in the same way we applaud LeBron for doing well in a broken system in the 2015 Finals, but it is so unbelievably bad for a player of his standing."
"73%? That's a random ass probably untrue number.   Of course it's most popular player is gonna create larger viewership, but there's plenty of very popular teams/players still in the playoffs.   Including Steph Curry/Kevin Durant/Russell Westbrook/James Harden/Kyrie  Irving/Giannis Antetokounmpo and Warriors/Raptors/Celtics/76ers/Rockets/etc.    This guys blatantly ignoring the fact that The NBA builds with (NOT ON) it's popular players and teams so that he can push his stupid political agenda."
Russell Westbrook apparently
"yeah, portland lost 4/5 starters one year and went to the second round of the playoffs right after with no excuses of 'this team sucks except for damian' or 'they were too good of a match up for us.'  i'm not on a high horse at all, i'm surprised. after the regular season performance against y'all and losing nurk i thought a third sweep was coming. this series isn't even over, tf would i be feeling so high and mighty about? y'all could easily tie it up on your home court.  you're just trying to cop a plea to forgive russ' lack of playoff success post-durant using the weakest excuses to shield him from criticism: his team was bad and they matched up better. really? lol is russell westbrook the first person to drag a bad team to the playoffs? no. is he the first person to play on a team that is so outmatched by their opponents? no. he shouldn't be scotch free of criticism because of that, we shouldn't look at these past post-seasons and say 'well it shouldn't count against him cause the 2017 thunder really sucked besides him and the jazz were the best team at defending the paint in 2018.'"

"Do we need more evidence that Russell Westbrook is an immensely overhyped player? The dude stat hunts for his numbers and plays the most selfish brand of basketball there is. @ me all day, I don't give a damn. He's been indefensible this series."
I've been saying for years that I'd take Kyrie over Russell Westbrook easily.
"He hasn't made one since February 18th, 2018. He has attempted 4 'ankle breaker stand and delivers' since then and missed all of them.   He needs to ball instead of look nice.   Love Harden but don't like what he has turned in to regarding his ""MVP"" attitude. Play ball, don't act like you the greatest baller on the planet cuz you ain't. Not even top 5 for real.  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry...  Paul George? Russell Westbrook? Joel Embiid? Karl Anthony Towns? Devin Booker? Kyrie Irving?  Who would we truly take James Harden over...?"
Russell Westbrook
"Lmao they look kind of alike too. Plus, Russell Westbrook definitely gives me a Kyrgios vibe."

"he was on a very good oklahoma city team with russell westbrook. in 2016 they were up 3-1 in the conference finals against the golden state warriors, they ended up losing three in a row to blow the series. they were set up to be contenders competing with the warriors for the future, instead he left and joined the warriors that offseason.   he is also very sensitive to criticism and media, he was exposed for having alternate twitter accounts to argue and talk trash to fans last year which isn't surprising at all with his personality."
Friendly reminder that James Harden and Kevin Durant used to play on the same basketball team and that Russell Westbrook was also in fact on that team.

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Russell Westbrook. His basketball skillset is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Billy Donovan's pre-game plans the reasoning behind most of his shots will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Russ's offensive outlook, which is deftly woven into the Thunder's gameplans - his personal playstyle draws heavily from basketball genius Carmelo Anthony, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have a stolen franchise and thus truly appreciate the ball bricking off the rim on a contested pull-up three with 21 on the shot clock, the way that they bricked the city of Seattle in the face - they say something deep about LIES. As a consequence people who dislike Russell Westbrook truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Russ's existencial catchphrase ""Next question"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Clay Bennett's scheme to move the SuperSonics. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Westbrook fights for a rebound with Steven Adams. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Russell Westbrook tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that in high school basketball they were within 5 points-per-possession of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
Russell Westbrook genuinely has no shame. Like jeez. You don't have to be the best player in the league. Just fucking don't always make it about YOU. Losing happens. Losing the same way because you refuse to change your game is embarrassing and you really really need SOMEONE in your life to tell you that you're fucking up the lives of other people because you refuse to change. PG gave up a dream he had since a child to stay with you. Billy fairly or unfairly is gonna get fired because of you. Dudes are surely gonna get traded. All because you gotta go out on your sword and Chuck shots. Like it's not ok that you're 30 years old and can't think off anyone in the organization other than yourself.

"lol just because someone is doing their job doesn't make their job worth doing.   Please read this sentence carefully. Russell Westbrook shouldn't be such a dick to every media member, because they are just fellow people. Now that you know I agree with that, can you admit that sports journalism, in its current state, is fucking toxic for the journalists, the players, and the fans?   Why the hell would anyone side with the toxic system over the person who hates the toxic system? And then call him toxic? That's the same thinking that has people screaming Blue Lives Matter in the faces of people who lost loved ones to excessive police force. That's the same thinking that has people saying incarceration should be an excuse to revoke voting rights. Not trying to make it too political, but the root of injustice is in siding with the oppressor and the parallels literally write themselves in this case.   I'm not being hyperbolic just to prove a point. That was literally a question. How are you siding with the people who get paid to sow divide in sports teams over the players who have to overcome that unnecessary obstacle?"

Dude seriously go fuck yourself. Russell Westbrook outside of media interactions has been nothing short of an amazing person. When his best friend died in high school he went over to his house and did his chores. When he won a car for mvp he donated it to a single mom in OKC. Not to mention his reading rooms he has placed in schools throughout the state. Obviously there is something different about the media but he's been nothing short of a saint beyond that.
"I saw Russell Westbrook at a grocery store in Portland yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

The fans understand this stuff; they have a stolen franchise and thus truly appreciate the ball bricking off the rim on a contested pull-up three with 21 on the shot clock, the way that they bricked the city of Seattle in the face - they say something deep about LIES. As a consequence people who dislike Russell Westbrook truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Russ's existencial catchphrase ""Next question"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Clay Bennett's scheme to move the SuperSonics. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Westbrook fights for a rebound with Steven Adams. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Russell Westbrook tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that in high school basketball they were within 5 points-per-possession of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
Is Russell Westbrook gonna have to Sprewell a bitch?
"At the beginning of last season, this video of Westbrook made the front page of /r/nba   It was a video of Westbrook laughing at a nervous sports journalist.  The vast majority of people on this subreddit saw Westbrook's reaction as adorable.  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/72ec1u/reporter_too_nervous_to_ask_westbrook_a_question/dnim57y/  And I got downvoted when I questioned how how reddit could perceive this objectively douchey move by Westbrook as ""adorable""?  /u/NotoriousOKC asked me: &gt;Do you have some kind of social disorder?  To which I responded:  &gt;westbrook's reaction is to laugh at the mess up and hide his laughter behind his hand. that's the definition of facepalm. i'm not saying it rises to the level of bullying, but it's definitely closer to bullying than it is adorable. adorable would've been russell saying something to comfort the young, embarrassed sports writer.  Westbrook is a good basketball player. But he's also a bully."

"I have learned as I tried to write a response that I have very mixed feelings about this.  It is very easy for me to say that you should treat everyone you interact with kindness and respect but I spend most of my day in an office by myself then go home to a house by myself and maybe stop by the store on the way home. I have friends and family that I talk to but if I have a shitty day the last thing I want to do is chat with anyone.  It's not too hard for me to muster up the energy to fake my way through a few conversations a day even if I'm not feeling it.  I can't even imagine how much a high profile athlete is bombarded by the media and I think perspective is important. And to top it off, if he has an off day at his job the bombardment only intensifies.  Sounds like she was very hyped for an interview 2 years ago and then it was just another Tuesday for Russell.  She could have been the 10th interview he had that day and he was tired of answering the same 10 questions with the same bullshit PR response because he knows if he spoke his mind he would get torn to shreds.  He could have just found out a good friend was in the hospital and was distracted but knew he still had to show up to the interview.  He could have shot 1/15 from the field the night before and could care less about his shoe contract, much less a puff piece he had to do because of his  He could have tweaked his ankle in practice that day and was just worried about the impact it could have on the only thing he's really known his whole life.  Westbrook is obviously a very emotional player. Knowing this about yourself, sometimes not engaging at all is the best decision.  Sure he makes a bunch of money and has spectacular athletic capabilities, but him being a media darling isn't a given.  Saying he should just have to deal with the media because he is a high profile athlete is like saying a good looking person should just put up with cat calling with a smile and a wave. I mean it is a good looking person, how hard could things be?"
"I'm gonna stay off here, but I'm gonna say:  Fuck Berry Tramel.   Fuck the media that loves Pop and shits on Russ.   OKC loves Russell Westbrook. Hope the guys have fun tonight and play loose. It would be nice to get one more in OKC and we better get a ""Fuck You Tramel"" chant going."

"Absolutely LOVE Russell Westbrook. Doesn't answer the media's inane bullshit questions, and doesn't fall for their bait where they try to get sound bytes from him to formulate some sort of manufactured drama and rivalry with other players like they always do because the NBA media is the worst in the worst. And don't try to give me any bullshit that they never do that... because they do it almost ever week of the season, every week there's another fake ""beef"" NBA journalists make up to get more clicks to their dumbass blogs and articles that NBA fans salivate over.  Keep doing what you're doing, Russell."
"Someone else mentioned this already but sports journalism/media has such a gravity when it comes to people’s opinions on players. I imagine half of y’all would’ve hated Michael Jordan if media was as prevalent as it is now. I’m sure it’s fun to pile on a guy when he’s down (as this sub is known to do), I just find it a bit convenient that these stories of Russell Westbrook seemingly being a dickhead have suddenly clawed their way from the underbelly of the sports journalist community right as he’s underperforming during the playoffs.   I’m not saying how he’s acting is right or wrong, that’s not the point. I’m sorry Ms. Knight wasted a day of her life. I’m sorry a lot of reporters feel that Russ is being unfair. I get it. That being said, no one knows why Russ is the way he is. You can’t fully call him a dick because his teammates love him. He has a genuinely great charity he’s heavily involved in as it’s not some company that a player slapped their name on. He’s a positive member of the community. He just has zero patience for media types. And honestly, it’s surprising more players don’t act this way."
Russell Westbrook: Hold my Beer
"Russell Westbrook on if there is anyone worse to reporters than him: ""I don't compare myself with anybody,"" Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of a giant dick. ""I'll let you interpret that however you want,"" Westbrook said."
"Man, Russ is the biggest asshole I’ve ever seen as an athlete. People I know try to justify his actions, but there’s no reason to be a complete dick to people, one day he’s going to realize how tiring it is to constantly be mad all the time.   He’s good, I’m not taking that from him, but holy shit, who the hell is Russell Westbrook in the scheme of things? Fuck your Russ."
"Pretty unfair of y'all to lump all media members in like that. Idk why anyone is acting like ""Russell Westbrook acts like an asshole"" can't be a conclusion reached independently from media influence either. He's been adversarial to everyone for years"
It seems like this is kind of how the OKC organization is though. Good read from 2014: http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/
Local sports radio blamed Russell Westbrook for all the Thunder's issues during the entire Durant era.

I used to work in local OKC media and Westbrook was also always a dick to me and the rest of the press pool every time I encountered him. We’d be at local community events covering the team giving back to their community and Russell always acted like a child being forced to clean their room when he had to come answer a handful of softball questions about the event.  I personally saw this happen on 4 separate occasions.
http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/
Finally this is getting big attention. I always thought Russell Westbrook was very mean and disrespectful towards the media. Just a rude spiteful person. It’s crazy how different lebron and Russel treat the media. I have so much respect for lebron as a human being and as a player.
"Fourth quarter in Portland, Blazers lead by 15 with two minutes left to play. Russell Westbrook has struggled so far, with 21 points on 24 field goal attempts, 12 assists, 7 turnovers and 9 rebounds.   McCollum baseline jumper...no good! Westbrook grabs his tenth rebound! Another triple double from the only man in the modern era to average a triple double!  What's this? Adam Silver has called a timeout! The Thunder have been awarded twenty free throws! Well, ladies and gentlemen, we knew Oklahoma City have a 80% chance of winning when Westbrook has a triple double. Truly phenomenal basketball here in Game 5."
"Russell Westbrook is the complete opposite of a douchebag...  He’s a family man, and it’s been documented many fucking times that he’s one of the nicest people to fans.  You’re the one who’s acting like a pompous asshole by assuming false things about a man."
"""You miss 100% of shots you take"" - Russell Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook is the worst human ever.  I hope he has multiple career ending injuries.
Russell Westbrook in Shambles
This bitch really trying to metoo Russell Westbrook because he wouldn't give her his full undivided attention. Fuck is wrong with yall.
"This story is a fucking joke, “I would’ve gone back to my room and cried if it was early in my career”  “Wasted a day of my life” lol  Russell owes nothing to the media, and should not be obligated to appease them. This sounds like an attention seeking story at a really convenient time to hate Russell Westbrook.  I love the drama that comes with Russell’s game and his inefficiency, but the questions about his character are stupid. He has proven he is a good teammate, role model in the community and has never done anything actually wrong. Media can stay butthurt, Russell owes them nothing and if you don’t want to deal with him then fuck off?"
As someone who enjoys shitting on Westbrook I will say - it's kinda great that he's totally genuine and unapologetic about it. I mean I see it this way: Russell is so dedicated to being an asshole to the media that he's willing to take a literal monetary hit and torpedo a puff piece about his shoe brand just to continue acting that way.   Can't say I know many other plays who'd do the same. Sucks for whoever has to end up interviewing him though.
I respect Russell Westbrook even more now. Fuck the media leave it on the court.
"&gt; Russell Westbrook wasnt nice to you, so you cried in your car?   Found the one that didn't actually read the story."
"Man I’m from OKC. We had nothing mate. Oklahoma is not known for its bustling metropolitan areas and cool destination spots. It’s known for meth and terrible schools. I wouldn’t have blamed him for leaving when his contract was up. But not only did he stay he’s given us a playoff contending team and mvp performances year in and year out. He got us PG. he’s given us everything. And now, OKC is actually a cool place to be. I’m not saying Russell Westbrook created uptown, the plaza, revamped bricktown, and rallied our teachers to go on strike, but his presence in our city has given us something to be proud of. It gave us a new image. He’s nothing but kind to every person he interacts with outside of the court (except the media lol). When he’s on the court he’s a fierce competitor. He gets heated. He gives it his all. When he’s not doing his job, he’s a great guy and someone I’m proud to have representing my city."
"God why would anyone ever admit that publicly? You know how weak that's gotta make you look to your peers? Russell Westbrook wasnt nice to you, so you cried in your car? That's embarrassing as shit."
"Wait people are just realizing this now? Some people just don’t like people. For every Russell Westbrook we get a Joel Embiid, remember that. There must be balance."
"You wanna make nice trades but won’t include Grant in any of them unless it’s for a superstar like AD or Beal? With Russ and PG off the table, the only player teams would find attractive is Grant and maybe Ferguson. You think Thibs is going to be a good fit with Russell Westbrook? That’s a disaster waiting to happen, thibs did a uninspiring job in Minny, not sure why you’d want him. Not trying to be a negative Nancy but OKC under Westbrook has plateaued. There’s isn’t a shooter that’s available for the MLE that’s going to lift this team past the second round."
WOW RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS WORSE THAN LUKE WALTON?
"He’s going to answer “next question” in a personal conversation after the presser or outside of work? Robert Littal commented in this thread and pointed out how Russ is great when there’s no media around, that might be a good time to figure out why he’s being short with you specifically. Asking during a public press conference would be a childish thing to do.   People like Tramel are happily inserting themselves into the story, the guy is doing a media tour and positioning himself as the Russ critic. Meanwhile writers are giving their Russ ‘horror stories’ as if this guy is some sort of sociopath. What’s especially interesting about this conversation is Popovich does the same thing, haven’t heard Steve Kerr call that dangerous.  I’ve seen some great Russell Westbrook interviews in the past. Check out his video interview with Graham Bensinger, it’s candid and really good. Maybe instead of insinuating that Westbrook sees other people as ‘sub human’ you can maturely figure out the source of the problem. And if he doesn’t give you a good answer, move on. What I’m noticing though is that there’s value in actually talking negatively about Westbrook in terms of visibility over actually trying to get him to answer basketball-related questions."
Russell Jeffery Westbrook would never
Russell Westbrook is a scum bag. I am beyond thrilled to hear every time he gets a triple-double and they still lose. Prima donna egotistical POS.

Is russell westbrook the worst player in the league?
"The Anti-Westbrook train is leaving Oklahoma at breakneck speed, even faster than the coward Kevin Durant left in the summer of 2016. Russell Westbrook’s reputation amongst, and treatment of, members of the media has reached a zenith just as his team sits on the brink of an early postseason exit, no doubt the fault of several hatchet-faced referees, a pinheaded fanbase, and an old sack of oatmeal named Raymond Felton.  Russell Westbrook has been accused of refusing to answer questions from the media, sometimes refusing to even make eye contact. On behalf of all writers, we can barely look at ourselves in a mirror, so why should Russ have to?  Russell Westbrook is having historically bad post season stats, but it’s hard to be efficient at basketball when your hands are busy carrying Paul George, who injured himself at his second job as the inflatable man at a used car dealership, and with both of his eyes trained on Berry Tramel, who looks like if doing Whippits in the back of a 94 Dodge Ram was a person.  Even Steve Kerr has piled on, calling Westbrook’s actions “dangerous to the league.” But the only danger Steve Kerr is an expert in is getting punched in the face by Michael Jordan.  Does Russell Westbrook have a contractual obligation to cooperate with the media? Maybe, but my cousin had a contractual obligation to stay away from the local high school, and now he’s serving 3 to 5 in county. Free Hambone  Does Russell Westbrook have a moral obligation to cooperate with the media? I’m reminded of the old saying “it takes more muscles to smile than it does to frown.” But only at first! Have you seen what 25 years of sadness does to the human body? My grandma is the unhappiest person I’ve ever met and her face looks like a haunted mask from an Indian burial ground. Anyway. MY POINT IS that Russell Westbrook is a smart, handsome and good player, and I say this not just because I’m a fan, but because I am financially invested in gaining access to Russel Westbrook.  If you’re reading this, Russ, I promise to write fawningly about you (triple doubles are underrated! Stat chasing is good!) unflinchingly about your enemies (Why does Pat Beverley look like he should be selling bean pies on the subway?) and most of all, I promise to never subject you to the Ramsey Bolton-esque torture of ever making direct eye contact. I love you Russ."
"Billy Donovan and Russell Westbrook should be the next two pieces to go. Donovan first, as I think he's probably one of the worst coaches in the league, and his game plan seems to be to rely on the talent they have. If they change coaches and still can't win, it's gotta be Westbrook leaving next if he can't adapt to a different coaching style other than hero ball for 48 minutes. Brooks and Donovan are basically the same person coach wise, so I believe Westbrook would be able to change and adapt to an actual system hopefully."
Um it's obviously racial in large part. Look at the people who have been most disciplined in sports for their conduct with the media. Cam Newton. Marshawn Lynch. Russell Westbrook. Look at the people who are tolerated for their disrespect of the media. Bill Belichick. Pop.
I dont think Russell Westbrook is ever gonna get the picture.
"Overall, I kind of feel bad for Westbrook. Out of college he gets immediately moved from the 2 guard to the 1, and he has had Scotty Brooks and Billy Donovan as coaches. They both may be great college coaches, and I don't question their basketball knowledge. But neither strikes me as that ""leader of men"". I never see Billy Donovan chewing ass hardly. And it's about accountability. Someone needs to get after Westbrook when he makes terrible shot choices. At this point, I would be interested to see if there would be an overall improvement if Russell was moved to the 2 and a decent point guard was brought in."
Russell westbrook is only 30 though /s
Russell Westbrook is actually a great shooter (compared to Ben Simmons)
"It really comes down to your teammates stepping up when needed.  Hell it took MJ 3 tries to beat the Pistons and when he finally trusted his teammates and the system of the triangle offense, he won 6 titles because of it.  Still MJ took over the game when he needed to, but That's what Russell Westbrook has to do.  Step it up come playoff time and his teammates have his back when needed.  Dirk got his ring because he had help from Shawn Marion on defense, Tyson Chandler in the paint, Jason Kidd controlling the pace of the game, and Jason Terry shooting 3's, and JJ Barea off the bench.  Last 2 minutes, Dirk took over when he needed to and that's why he has his ring."
"I hope so. I'm sick of having to avoid all sports related social media because it's ""shit all over OKC and Russell Westbrook week""."
How about:  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Kendrick Perkins
"Russell ""I'm going to shut that shit down"" Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook was BCC’ed /s
Damn you get up on us in one series and start saying shit like this. Russell Westbrook is one hundred percent going down as a top 10 point guard of all time and you say he’s not a legend
"Normally, an NBA possession averages to 1.3 points, so a typical turnover costs 2.6 points.  But Russell is special.  When he turns the ball over, he uses his grit to make a highlight the very next play.  So turnovers are, like, a positive because it's Russell Westbrook  This is why he demands respect from his peers, teammates, fans, and general manager.  You see, when you're on top, everyone wants to take you down.  That's the only thing that's happening.  Do you understand?"
"Perfect? The ideal roster for Russell Westbrook - a player who excels in drive and kick, is non-shooters so the other team can pack the paint?"
"He shot 28% from 3 this year. If he wants to work on his shooting efficiency he better work on his inside and mid-range because that 3 is never going to develop into anything respectable. Also if he can get his mid range game going consistently, that should also translate into bumping his abysmall 65% free throw percentage as well and that alone would significantly improve his game. His best year shooting the 3 was his mvp year and even that was like 33%. It's not in his game. I don't know if thats the perfect way for him to improve, but i don't know what else could be a better solution. If you think him hoisting 3s is the answer, your gonna have a bad time  Derozan is averaging 20 ppg and shot 48% from the field. Thats leagues better than what Westbrook attempts and is on the higher side of shooting efficiency in the league. Hes no Kahwi but trying to act like he's a sccrub is just being disingenous. They are not better with him off the floor. Also I don't know why you brought up defense anyways, im saying russell needs to shoot like him not defend like him and be a carbon copy. If he had Derozans mid range game and efficiency and kept the rest of the WB athleticism, assists/rebounding, he'd be a much better player"
"This is a bad idea for multiple reasons. First, you're essentially raising the salary cap by €40M. Initially, one would think this would only apply to teams that have superstars, but really what would happen is that every team would try to use that cap space if the can, meaning that many mediocre players are going to be getting supermaxes, thus widening the gap between teams. If a team chooses not to use that, then they're at a clear disadvantage, so they will probably be forced to tank until they get that one generational talent, meaning that the average tanking team will continue to be bad for a long time.  Second, this is really unfair on the players. Say in the case of OKC, they clearly would've used that on KD, but because you can't supermax more than one player, James Harden and Russell Westbrook would never be eligible for a supermax, even after becoming MVPs themselves. Kyrie would not be eligible for one either, because in all likelihood LeBron stays in Cleveland and takes that spot. And teams like the Rockets and the Celtics are then going to prefer super-maxing their own guys over other teams' players, even if that player is significantly worse. So what this will essentially create is a lot of supermax-level players who will not be getting supermax contracts, and a lot of non-supermax-level players that will end up getting those contracts."
"you're arguing something unrelated to the point I made. Russell Westbrook coming into the season was an All-NBA guy, this year his shooting fell off (as I said).  My point was that entering the season this was the argument many had. I don't want to debate whether he's worthy of being on 3rd team All-NBA."
I'll be honest. I dont feel like Westbrook cares as much about winning as he cares about his own personal ego. I like Russell. I love his fire and drive. But I get the feeling it comes from a place of selfishness. Every team needs a Westbrook. No team needs a Westbrook as their leader.
"No cast that forces one player to be the only offensive option is a good one. Even if that player is Russell Westbrook, it means teams swarm one player, it means passing is less of an option. Is there any player who would seriously be better if they were the only person shooting on their entire team?"
On this sub you either die a Damian Lillard or you live long enough to see yourself become Russell Westbrook.
Only an insane person would say that Russell Westbrook is a bad player. But he’s a jerk.

"He was 1/7 in just the series from 35+ feet, people do like cherry picking the 30+ stat though. If that was a 'good shot' for Dame, he would consistently be making Steph Curry look like Russell Westbrook. No one is that good."
"..""y'all know who i am, iam russell westbrook"""
"Having a terrible shooting year is bad.  He isn’t good defensively, so whatever value he is giving you in aggregate is minimal.  And yes, if someone had never watched basketball before and just started this season, their first question would be why do people think Russell Westbrook is good?"
Mitchell reminds me a lot of young Russell Westbrook. But I also think he'd benefit tremendously from having a wing scorer alongside him.
"&gt; That'll change when they see Giannis  Not denying his all-star talent but **Giannis is poor man's Javale Mcgee in terms of pure ATHLETICISM.**  Bro, dude's not Russell Westbrook. He's a great player who utilizes his length extremely well.  So cringey to see you folks foaming at the mouth (""He explodes to the rim!!"") whenever Giannis does his lethargic arm dunks.."
Russell “Criticize me enough and eventually I’ll work on expanding my game” Westbrook
"Cus they have 2 All-NBA players. The one team we've seen beat the Warriors was one with 2 All-NBA players and incredible individual offense is difficult to defend. This was before Russell Westbrook fell off a cliff shooting the basketball this season.  That said, don't see many who believe OKC is a bigger threat than Houston."
"People need to stop this bullshit. I think PG is mostly right, though I wouldn't call it a 'bad shot', I'd call it a 'bad shot choice', because if I was in his shoes, I'd be happy with Dame taking that shot in that situation 100 times out of 100.  Let's not pretend that Dame hits this shot every time. If he did, he would be a basketball god that makes Steph Curry look like Russell Westbrook. In no way does it make it less impressive, but just because Steve Kerr, who has the buttered up media personalty of Big Tobacco lawyer, said otherwise doesn't mean PG should be unhappy with the shot he gave Lillard."
Speaking of Kanter [this PT article ](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/enes-kanter-russell-westbrook-nba-mvp-2017)is a good read

I could score as many points as Russell Westbrook if I shot the ball fifty times a game like him.
If he leads the league in shooting then I will be god damned lol. All my hate for Russell Westbrook will be turned into love

Supposedly the [rule change on free throws messed with his routine.](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25664754/russell-westbrook-roller-coaster-offense-slowing-thunder-nba) Seems plausible.
"I am so fucking tired of watching this 6'2"" fucktard running around the court for 40 minutes every single fucking game. It's like there's this light in his brain that lights up whenever he can get an assist, rebound, or brick a three. But it's completely dim otherwise. I don't believe it's beyond this dickwipe- that's right, I'm insinuating Westbrook is a cloth of the variety of which you can wipe your dick with- to literally emasculate his center to get his tenth rebound of the 52nd regular season game against the Suns. This walking brick flails his limbs after every three point shot. If there's not a defender in the entire fucking building, he'll still thrust his legs out and flail around wildly before falling to the floor as the ball sails ever so graciously into the unsuspecting beer-toting fatass 15 feet away from the hoop. It's fucking absurd. And the worst part is you thundercunts act like he's this generational talent, an absolute force to be reckoned with, but no. Fuck no. He's little more than an oddly athletic parasite who latches to the teet of the triple-double media, sucking them dry as he viciously fights for that tenth fucking assist. I truly believe that Russell Westbrook won't die unless there's a stat for ""deaths"" on the boxscore. THEN HE'LL DIE TEN FUCKING TIMES"

"I had Blazers in 6. I thought Russell Westbrook was better than that, but I guess I was wrong. I’m happy for Portland, tho. I’d like to see them go all the way."
"Throughout  the Portland-OKC series, Damian Lillard shot 26-54 (48.1%) from 3. Meanwhile Russell Westbrook shot just 17/37 (45.9%) at the rim (0-3 ft)."
"well the easiest answer to your question is sample size, regression to the mean, and past results not being an indicator of future results.  For example, if Russell Westbrook hits five threes in a row, it does not mean him taking another one is necessarily a good statistical shot.  but more in basketball terms- look at Lillard's follow through. That's not even his natural shooting form. You can see he hurried it and fell away. If you're a defender, you're trying to push a scorer to the hardest spots on the floor to hit from, away from their comfort zones.   Even Dame Lillard doesn't usually step back from that deep. Usually, he'll step into one with the defense kind of lagging back near the three point line.   Paul George forced Lillard into a low probability shot. That's probably a 10 to 15% likelihood of him making that. It's the shot you want him to take with the game tied. Statistically, it's so much better than a drive and potential to foul and win at the line. It's so much better than him driving and kicking to a wide open player.  But sometimes the best basketball play isn't the one that wins the game. It can be a bad shot AND Dame can be the fucking man."
"""When asked if he’d be naming his baby boy “Brick” after teammate Russell Westbrook, @OKCThunder SF Paul George replied, “Oh, hell no.”"

"&gt;Really, all of this hand-wringing over Mitchell, Westbrook, Russell, and even George makes you appreciate how transcendent you must be as a No. 1 option -- how impossible, how rare -- to elevate a normal roster into contention. Being an All-Star isn't enough. Being All-NBA sometimes isn't enough.&gt;   I love you Harden."
"Donovan ""Russell Westbrook"" Mitchell"
sure until yall blew a 15 pt lead with 8 minutes to go because of multiple bad plays  paul george didnt miss 3 free throws because of us  russell westbrook didnt take bad shots because of us  ignoring the meltdown and just going “oh well portland just played well! nothing we can do.” is stupid. okc had that game and they let it go
donovan mitchell: 22 years old  russell westbrook: 30 years old
"Donovan ""Russell Westbrook"" Mitchell"
"""Montrezl Harrell has one more made field goal this playoffs than Russell Westbrook with 57 fewer attempts""   https://twitter.com/fastbreakbreak/status/1121274845721919488?s=19"
"that's such a non parallel are you kidding? Donovan Mitchell is 22 has been the #1 player on his team since day 1 and has handled it incredibly well for the most part. Russell Westbrook is 30 and at this point, has solidified his reputation as a douchebag"
Would the clippers be willing to take on a disgruntled Russell Westbrook?
"He said this as he held his thirty-year-old son, Russell Westbrook, who was wrapped around his neck, his daddy’s hands cupping his bottom, which was covered with Blazers pajamas"
Lmao this list is so dumb.   &gt;Humble  who gives a shit if an nba star is humble  &gt; teachable  I'll give you this one  &gt; hard working  russell westbrook is one of the most hard working guys in the league and this has been known for years  &gt; respects the media  Oh no I'm clutching my pearls russ isn't nice to the media. who gives a shit  &gt; charismatic  I mean all of westbrook's teammates seem to love him and he got pg to stay   &gt; coachable  same thing as teachable  &gt; emotional  This one has to be satire. I'm begging that it's satire
Warriors playing at such a low level right now that even Russell Westbrook and OKC would be able to win a series against them.
but i thought he resigned because he wanted to congratulate Russell Westbrook on his triple doubles
"Is he really underrated tho?   He was first-team all nba last year. His team lost 4-0 in the first round to a New Orleans team that barely squeezed into the playoffs.   He didn’t make an all-nba team in the 2016-2017 season. The 6 guards who made it over him were Russell Westbrook (MVP season), James Harden (MVP-level season), Steph Curry (another fantastic season and team), Isaiah Thomas (king of the fourth was a real thing), John Wall (the one I could agree Lillard making it over, but Wall was one of, if not the only player in the league with 20+ points and 10+ assists per game), and DeMar DeRozan (finished with a high-seed and one of the Raptors deserved to be there). Worth noting that the Trailblazers finished eighth in the conference and were swept in the first round.   For the 2015-2016 season, Lillard made all-nba second team. The two players ahead of him were Steph Curry (mvp season) and Russ (fantastic season with good not great shooting).  The Trailblazers were taken out in the second round.   So in total, Lillard has played 7 seasons. He’s made the all star team 4 out of 7 years. He’s made an all-nba team 3 out of 6 years. He will make it again this year, making it 4/7.  He was the ROTY in a class that featured Anthony Davis, Bradley Beal, and Andre Drummond.   Overall, I think he’s coming into his own now, but I don’t think he’s really been underrated. I think more people know about him now, but going through his career he doesn’t look that underrated to me. I think this series just showed us that he’s past Russ (if anyone doubted that) and he deserves to be in the conversation for best PG in the league."
I watched that whole press conference and PG was literally giving him props with that statement. Westbrook was being a bitch again through the presser while PG was as professional as possible. Grow up Russell.
At worst he will be good version of russell westbrook.. not saying much though
"Spurs Brass: Greg, we'd like to bring in Russell Westbrook.  Pop: No thanks, I'd like to win another title before I retire."
And that sons name: “Russell Westbrook”
“Ja Morant has the potential to be better that Russell Westbrook.”  !remindme 340 days
And if media is going to treat it as such nobody should be bothered when people like Russell Westbrook or whomever decides they don't want to engage the media.  These players are required to keep some semblance of a healthy relationship with the media and if that's the case then there should be some respect for the boundaries of that relationship.
"I don’t care what anyone says Russell Westbrook is better than both of those guys. I mean you’re talking about point guards right? Who distribute the ball and run the offense? Westbrook averages the most assists does he not? The average is the most rebounds does he not?Irving and Dame are probably a little bit more efficient scorers but a point guard’s main concern is distributing the ball, and Westbrook does that.He would probably average 20 assists if guys actually had shots. Nobody seems to talk about that though in order to get an assist the other guy has to make the shot."
"I like you, I like your points, but a better Russell Westbrook? It’s wayyy too early to say that. Calm down. Have some respect for Russ"
1. John Wall 2. Andrew Wiggins 3. Chris Paul 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Gordon Hayward 6. Blake Griffin
From worst to best  John wall  Chris Paul  Andrew Wiggins  Gordan Hayward  Russell Westbrook  Blake Griffin
If you're more interested in playing in Oklahoma City with Russell Westbrook than in Los Angeles with Lebron... clearly you aren't interested in playing with Lebron.
For real. Look at today's stars. It's not a playoffs full of #1 overalls for a reason lol.        Active players with at least 3 all-star selections and their respective draft position noted in parentheses:       * LeBron James (1)   * Dirk Nowitzki (9)   * Chris Paul (4)   * Pau Gasol (3)   * Kevin Durant (2)   * Dwight Howard (1)   * Vince Carter (5)   * James Harden (3)   * Dwyane Wade (5)   * Tony Parker (28)   * LaMarcus Aldridge (2)   * Stephen Curry (7)   * Carmelo Anthony (3)   * Russell Westbrook (4)   * Paul Millsap (47)   * Kyle Lowry (24)   * Al Horford (3)   * Joe Johnson (10)   * Marc Gasol (48)   * Kevin Love (5)   * Blake Griffin (1)   * Anthony Davis (1)   * Damian Lillard (6)   * Jimmy Butler (30)   * Kawhi Leonard (15)   * Paul George (10)   * DeMar DeRozan (9)   * Kyrie Irving (1)   * Rajon Rondo (21)   * Giannis Antentokoumpo (15)   * Kemba Walker (9)   * Klay Thompson (11)   * John Wall (1)   * DeMarcus Cousins (5)   * Draymond Green (35)   * Derrick Rose (1)
Unpopular opinion: Draymond Green is a better player than Russell Westbrook (and Klay).
"Well, maybe there *are* different generational talents right now... It's just that they are generational talents in different things. For example, Steph Curry being a generational shooting talent, Russell Westbrook being a generational triple-double talent, James Harden being a generational foul-drawing talent, etc."
"The thing about Russell Westbrook IMO is that his entire game improves when he's shooting the ball well.  But he gets into those stretches of games where he seems to try to jump as high as he can and then when he's at the top of his jump to have that quick release shot.  He's never been any good at sustaining a decent percentage with this form (nor anyone else for that matter).  There was some noticeable improvement during one of the playoff games, can't remember which, maybe game 2 or 3 vs Portland, where he started just taking a little more time with his  shot, slowing things down a notch and getting a nice release, not putting so much emphasis in his jump.  He played like the old Russell during these stretches.  But I'm not sure he's willing or able to work on his shooting form.  He needs to just slow things down a bit and he's back in business."
"&gt; Klay is as good or better at passing, ball handling and driving to the rim as Russell Westbrook  - This fucking guy"
"His stat line is fine if the point was to have the player with the most stats.  What MJ learned from losing to those Celtics teams was that he couldn't do it alone - and he was trying to back then. He was basically a Russell Westbrook (though a better shooter) - a high energy, highly athletic player who seems like he can do anything.  MJ started winning once he stopped trying to do everything and played a true team game."
"Not to sound condescending (actually, I totally mean to sound condescending) but you can tell how much someone knows about basketball based on their opinion on Russell Westbrook and Draymond Green"
He was sick of playing with perpetual loser Russell Westbrook

"Tanking is a slightly less effective way to find success, however it only works for the better franchises overall. Ultimately a good owner and good gm/staff are the most important. If the owner is too involved/won’t pay luxury tax/won’t pay for Coach/Training/GM/President team is probably fucked. Look at Charlotte/Suns/Old Clips/Knicks, they in lottery over and over and even when these teams do get great players, they squander their potential or they leave (KG/Leb/AD/newer bulls owner/Was). Some of these owners aren’t even that stupid compared to average but cheaping out is absolute no go (see OKC/HOU.   Good owners often find themselves in successful situations consistently and while it may seem like the odds are stacked in the favor, these are quietly the delayed results of these good moves. Spurs/Celtics/Utah/Por/Tor/OKC/Dal are seemingly always in a pretty good spot despite facing major setbacks  Spurs: Kawhi injury,  Kawhi Trade, blowing 2-0 lead in 2012 into 2013 finals. Lots of blown FAs  Celtics: 2010 G7, KG injury, 2012 vs Mia, 2016/2017 playoffs, Early 2000s shit show, Birds/Mchale rapid decline. Len Bias,Russells retirement. Kyrie team chemistry   Portland: Chokes/bad drafts/injuries. ET/ML contracts and poor FA appeal. We’ll see in the future though RIP  Utah: Crushing finals losses/losing  top 2 franchise player in 2 years, get good rapidly and bad luck with Williams/Boozer, Okur injury. Even when Sloan retired it didn’t take long. They literally replaced Hayward almost instantly and avoided and potential horrible contract going forward if injury still happened. They get no FAs and play in a tough conference but always are good  OKC: SEA chose the wrong years to become a contender in the 90s. Blowing 2-0 lead to 8 seed nuggets. Juggling George Karl, Payton, and Kemp personalities and still being good. Somehow overcoming the financially/FA/PR horrible decision of leaving Tech/Big market Seattle for OKC, with very few people hating them for it(outside of PNW) by drafting 3 future MVPs in 3 years. Possibly worst trade/FA decision this century with harden (Bos-Nets, Gasol close tho), blowing 3-1 lead to GSW and losing generally considered 2nd best player drafted in NBA since 2000 for nothing. Westbrook/Durant/Ibaka/Roberson injuries in playoff runs. somehow getting quality player with their only decent draft pick of that era Adams and somehow only barely overpaying for him in a Summer full of awful contracts. Hustled  Orlando for Ibaka, Trading for George on a seemingly rental/losing a potential star in Oladipo and somehow managing to sign him to 3/4 year deal too. Trading and removing Carmelo Anthony more effectively than Knicks. Somehow being consistently good with bad coaches for 10 years straight.  Tor: Lose future superstar McGrady/2001 playoffs and Vince quitting, Bosh leaving, awful FA pull (Bosh/Nash/Tmac/VC). Picking off a top 5 GM in the league despite him already having that rep. Drafting well despite not having good picks, Somehow getting non playoff performing players over and over and overpaying for those players (Lowry/Crabbe/Derozan). Horrific Seem cursed playoff runs. Swept by lower seed wizards/G7 loss at home nets/going 2-12 versus Lebron in 3 consecutive years including losing 10 straight playoff games. home G1 curse/trash bros. Questionably firing COTY and somehow being relatively fine despite losing out on Bud. Somehow dominating Trade with one of smartest teams Spurs. In top 5 team in NBA  for 3/4 years and despite potential for Kawhi to leave in excellent position to effectively rebuild quickly (siakam, contracts ending same year)  Dal: Horrible handling of early 2000s big 3. Dirk injury in against Kings early 2000s. Overcoming lopsided officiating in 06 and arguably worst choke in 07. Winning a title in an ERA with Kobe’s Lakers/Big 3 Spurs/(Harden/KD/Russell on 1 team)/Big 3 Celtics/and Lebrons Heat. Bad Drafts luck, overcoming worst pick out of 3 teams tie in draft and ending with player most people considered best in draft Luka despite having 5th pick. Bad FA decisions (Parsons Contract/Rondo Trade/Harrison Barnes/Matthews Contract). Decently handling a potential franchise ruining sexual harassment scandal in arguably the worst time in modern history to have a sexual harassment scandal. Having an involved owner who somehow isn’t horrible.  Meanwhile the Knicks wasted Melo/KP lots of 2000s FAs and top 5 FA appeal/financial situation  NO squandered CP/probably AD , hopefully they don’t with Zion. Named team Pelicans  Suns: I’ll give pass on 05-10 suns they did their best, however between 96-2005 they lost Nash/Kidd and  their star trainer and have made horrific coachi  hires, coach fires , GM, Contract, and Draft picks year after year. Despite pretty good lottery luck  Sac: never put an effective situation around cousins  and got a mediocre haul for him.  Going through multiple coaches and firing coaches who turned out to be good without replacing questionable GM. Horrible trades/drafts/and contracts. Hopefully they don’t waste Dearon Fox too.  Rant almost over. Fans seems to overlook the biggest factor on team success ownership, that or everyone ignores because there’s nothing they can do and it’s depressing realization. Sigh Orlando"

They were guarding him like he was Russell Westbrook
Kanter is guarding Steph as if that's Russell Westbrook.
&gt;Russell Westbrook	  bruh
"For some that may not know what averaging a triple double for a season means:  add up all the points made; the number of rebounds made; the number of assists made; the number of blocks made for the entire season (82 games) then divide each of the aforementioned categories by 82 and the resultant number for each of the categories comes out double digits for 3 of the 4 categories then the player has achieved the term - averaged a triple double for the season!!!!!!!!  Only one other player in the history of the NBA besides Russell Westbrook has ever accomplished this feat - Big O!!!!!!!!!  Big O did it only once in his career and when he did it - there were much fewer teams and players were not as big, strong, long and fast as today’s players!!!!!!  Russ accomplished this feat THREE seasons in a row!!!!!!!!! When he broke Big O’s season record for triple doubles - he won MVP!!!!!! Russ played his ASS OFF - deserves to b called one of the greatest of all time!!!!!!!  He just has not had the right players with him - it’s not his fault - it’s management’s fault!!!!!!!!!"
"Again, in support of how great Russ is:  wilt chamberlain only won 2 championships - jerry West and Elgin Baylor needed chamberlain to win one!!!!  Kareem needed Magic and magic needed Kareem - after Kareem retired that entire 80’s lakers team never won another championship - one guy gone makes that much difference!!!!!  Moses Malone needed Dr J and Dr J needed Moses Malone to win a championship!!!!!!  Look at bill Russell - the whole Celtics teams had all hall of fame players with him - won 11 championship!!!  Wilt won 2!!!!!!!!!  It’s about having the right players and combinations!!!!!  Westbrook unfortunately never had that - don’t blame one of the greatest player in the history of the NBA!!!!!  Three consecutive seasons of averaging a triple double - that’s INSANE!!!!  Only one player in the history of the NBA has ever averaged a triple double for a season - Big O - one of the greatest - and he needed big Lew (Kareem) to win a championship!!!!!!!!!!  Russ is a    NBA monster forever!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Perfect description of Russell Westbrook
"If they can hold off until December they can trade him to the Warriors for D'Angelo Russell.  Timelines would match up better as westbrook is around the same age as Curry, Thompson, and Green and Russell would be better off with a young rebuilding team like OKC."
Name one player that looks more like a cat than Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook and Paul George: 1 total last name between the 2  SGA: 2 last names by himself  Math checks out
X-factor player you say? I heard Russell Westbrook is on the trading block.
Hot take: Russell Westbrook is a skilled basketball player
"I really love Russell Westbrook as a basketball player but I also think concerns about his game’s aging and his albatross contract are justified.  I don’t know why we’ve drawn a line in the sand for him.  Like, prime Russ didn’t so much play angry as he became the earthly avatar for some sort of vengeful forgotten rage god.  I loved seeing him go off and dunk like he was trying to put a crater in the floor.  I think his MVP was fully justified and I can’t wait for the Houston Rockets to find this comment and send me a catty tweet about it.  But he *is* on the wrong side of 30, and that contract will hit the wrong side of 40, so I understand why people don’t like it."
The 13th Pick (who was a reach by most big boards) in a weak(ish) draft. Not a “Russell Westbrook” Asset.
"I'm more worried about finding guys that put my franchise in contention to win a championship.   Russell Westbrook doesn't do that in my opinion.   And paying him that much money, cripples my chances of building a team that is able to win a championship."
You’re thicker than a bowl of porridge and barely more literate. Do you really think that Zach Lowe is arguing that Luke Kennard is better on the court Russell Westbrook?
"For the umpteenth time, ""more stars"" DOES NOT equal ""better dunk contest"". And essentially most of the stars you picked have some flaw.  &gt;Giannis Antetokounmpo:  Giannis was terrible in his previous dunk contest which does not inspire trust that he'll be much better this time Unless he has a dunking coach (someone to give him creative ideas) then I'd say no.  &gt;Russell Westbrook  Russ had several knee surgeries recently and may have lost some of his athleticism as a result. He's also on the wrong side of 30.  &gt;Joel Embiid:  Don't need to go into the MANY reasons why this is laughable.  &gt;Zion Williamson:   Probably the only good hypothetical contestant you brought up.  Bring in the best and creative dunkers available. If they happen to not be stars it's okay, the dunks should be the highlights, not the contestants. If they are stars, even better. But stars aren't essential in making a good dunk contest."

"Yes.  And here is the CARMELO projection predicting it as a fluke:  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/russell-westbrook/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/russell-westbrook/)   Lowe loves CARMELO afterall, so he should be aware that he'll bounce back.  I've made 3 comments adding to the ***factual*** history of Lowe bashing Russ and predicating every compliment with ""I guess I gotta say it"".  You're responding to everyone who even ***hints*** that Lowe is anything but a god and perfect."
"Maybe they can draft Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden again"
[Woj] Russell Westbrook to retire and pursue a career in fashion after hurtful words from /u/yamsalot
So you would give up good assets to pay Russell Westbrook over 40 million a year for 4 years?
What you guys really don't like hearing: Russell Westbrook is untradeable.
Russell Westbrook is not going to be a member of the OKC Thunder.
"that really isn't a good argument  I don't trade for health.. i trade for talent...  the best argument is him be 2nd team all NBA, making him a top 5 player..... but that top 5 player is a stat hunter that doesn't move win/shares , not because of effort.... because over usage.  it sucks when a top 10 player think's be is better than he really is...   he shoots 30% from 3s, but still chucks 411 last year, 326 before , and 583 before that.... that is ridiculous lack of self awareness  wade is a good example -  actually better than westbrook last year shot 261...   41 and 70 , in years before that.   during the big 3, wade only avg like 50 3pt attempts for the whole year, which is why he was such an efficient scorer.   in 2019, westbrook shot 20.2 FGA avg, 5.6 on 3pA @ .290%, that is 27.72% of his shots coming in @ .87 pts per possession....  that is equivalent at shooting 43.5% from 2pt field, which is horrible for taking 20% of the teams shots.     20% of the offense comes at .84-.87pts per posession thanks to russ.... a 40% 3pt shooter = 1.2ppp  you would have like 33 more points for every 100 posessions russell gave to a 40% 3pt shooter...   thats what that means."
Maybe but if I'm OKC I'm not trading Russell Westbrook without getting Bam or Herro back.
"Yes, a rookie that never player in the league and had 2 good summer league games is more valuable than Russell Westbrook."
 **Russell Westbrook wanted out of OKC even before he arrived there - Marc J. Spears | The Jump**
"Fun list! Rooting for all the guys you mentioned except maybe Isiah Thomas, gotten kind of tired of his attitude. Anyway here is my list:  1: Kevin Durant: Just fucking with you lol  Actual 1. Dame Lillard:  Loyal. Stone cold killer. Plays beatiful basketball. Dope rapper. Would be a huge upset. How can you not love this guy?  2. Russell Westbrook: Obviously a lot of people won't agree with this one as it seems that you either love him or hate him. But with the way he leaves everything on the court I would love to see him win, think he would go crazy celebrating as well!  3. Vince Carter: Greatest dunker of all time. Old as fuck but can still contribute at a high level and hasn't ring chased but chosen to mentor young talent instead. Think he has earned it.   4. Kemba Walker: Been stuck on a shitty Charlotte team all of his career. Very entertaining style of play. Loyal and actually would have stayed with Charlotte if they paid him. Just seems like a great guy.   5. Mike Conley  Agree with you seems like a great teammate and guy. Somehow hasn't made an all star team despite performing at a really high level for years. Got love for all the former members of the grit n grind Grizzlies."
"All these Westbrook fanboys on r/nba out here, dismantling the roster and future plans of small market teams to find Russell a nice new home."
"&gt; I don't know how you got this info  https://thunderousintentions.com/2019/07/09/okc-thunder-russell-westbrook-prefers-heat/ Your sports writers, ours, a quarter of the NBA media is talking about this scenario when they're not mentioning the Lakers, Zion or KD.   The Heat are not the sort of team to chase success? The Heat have a harder working culture than any team in the NBA. That's literally why Jimmy signed with us.   We had no cap space or assets at the start of off-season, now we have Jimmy Butler BECAUSE OF OUR DESIRE TO WIN ALONE.  Can you really say Miami isn't the type of team to chase success when we've never blown up or started tanking, yet that's what your franchise is currently doing? Also, rings Ernie. Rings."
"Watch out for Russell Westbrook, new Orlando Magic PG. I know it sounds silly, but Bamba, Aaron Gordon and one of the bigger money expiring contracts and you’ve got it done if Thunder are cool with it. I think that may be what’s happening here. It would be fucking weird but we’re living in a weird NBA."
"Oh so like Lebron in 2016 then? Except that Lebron is the guy people criticize for always being on superteams and 'needing more help'.  Meanwhile Kd is going from the Westbrook to Curry to Kyrie, Kawhi is going from Duncan to Aldridge to Lowry to Paul George, and Curry is going from Klay to Kd to Russell."
&gt;  it doesn't benefit him  I meant off court. On court he does have a problem of not holding himself accountable but i think that's an easily coachable thing&gt;  &gt;Tim Duncan to Russell Westbrook  Or ISO Kawhi or ISO lamarcus
"Why are we giving up everyone for Beal in this.. I can only assume that's why we're giving up 3 of the kids, also offloading a perfectly serviceable Dragon and Maple Dick, which is an overpay to me. I'd rather wait until, I don't know, the offseason next year when he becomes a free agent and we have a ton of contracts expiring?  And for Westbrook? Presti should accept that we're offering them Cap Relief over the next 4 years. I sure as shit don't want to be paying a 34 year old Russell, but I'd take it, if they want expiring contracts to remain competitive until next offseason.   What people don't seem to understand is that that alone is more of a win-win in favour of OKC. They get to have Max Slots and a ton of Draft Picks next year - We get an aging All-star, with a god awful contract that we'll be stuck with, making us inflexible for years to come. I want it for that Veteran Leadership. To help our young guys learn what it means to be INTENSE. It's worth the hit, but only if we have players to learn from him. What's the point if they're all bloody gone!  I don't want Westbrook or Beal if it means trading the farm - Who wants to come to a gutted team with no potential left? And I'd rather wait a year to try for Beal after letting our young guns run wild with Butler."
"People should realize Russell Westbrook plays like he wants to win, but only his way.   No amount of talent or prestigious coaching will change that."
"Dude. Get out of your echo chamber. A quick google search show's it's more than Russ.   Here's an article by former NBAer Etan Thomas  https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/15/russell-westbrook-fan-abuse-utah-jazz-racist  Below is an excerpt from your hometown newspaper  https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2019/03/16/utah-jazz-fans-have/  &gt;The Utah Jazz fan stigma exists, and has for a while. Former NBA players Kenyon Martin, Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes are just some who have said their trips to Utah during their playing days featured racial epithets. Golden State star Kevin Durant has noticed how the at-times crazed atmosphere will cause Jazz fans to toss off any limits on what they direct toward the opposing team.  &gt;“I said it b4 @utahjazz have the most racist fans in the @NBA,” Barnes, a longtime Jazz nemesis tweeted."
"OHH, RUSSELL WESTBROOK!!  ....freaking chills man"
Westbrook for Russell at the all star break? Westbrook could fill the void Iggy + KD left.  He is basically a hybrid of the two.  Okc can try to build a young team around D'Angelo.
\*according to Russell Westbrook
"West 1. Lakers 2. Blazers 3. Jazz 4. Clippers 5. Nuggets 6. Spurs 7. Warriors 8. Mavs   No Rockets in top 8, they implode on themselves. The new Mavs duo goes off this season.  East 1. Celtics 2. Bucks 3. 76ers 4. Heat 5. Pacers 6. Raptors 7. Pistons  8. Nets  Celtics young guys and Hayward flourish with the acquisition of Kemba, they excel instead of continue to regress. Miami trades for Russell ""Eastbrook"" Westbrook."
Never used DeMar as an excuse. I openly admitted he wasn’t good enough to win given how much of the cap was allocated to him.   I live DeMar but him at 30 million wasn’t going to win it all. Similar to how Russell Westbrook won’t ever win it all.
"I couldn't agree with you more every move we've made so far in the off season has been good but getting Russell Westbrook would erase all of those moves and put us in cap hell just like 2016 did when we signed Waiters, James Johnson and Kelly Olynyk."
&gt;MEMPHIS RECEIVES:  &gt;Russell Westbrook  &gt;Terrence Ferguson  &gt;OKC RECEIVES:  &gt;Josh Jackson  &gt;Kyle Anderson  &gt;Grayson Allen  &gt;Brandon Clarke  &gt;Miles Plumlee  &gt;2022 Memphis 1st Round (Unprotected)  &gt;2024 Memphis 1st Round (Unprotected)            this the kind of trade that Chris Wallace might have actually tried to do. I thank God everyday that he can't hurt us anymore.
"Russell Westbrook gets rebounds because the team designs it like that.   If Russ catches it, he can run immediately and get on the break.   If anyone else catches it, they have to pass it to him.   Even if it's a fraction of a second difference, it can be the difference on a fast break. Just ask Igoudala."
"LeBron James, Russell Westbrook"
"russell westbrook is one of the most impactful players in the league, for better or for worse"
"Not necessarily. Westbrook on the Pistons doesn't really help them with spacing. The team of Russ, Blake, and Drummond is a tough, tough lineup but they all play inside for the most part. And I'm not particularly fond of Detroit or Miami's benches as a whole.  Russ and Jimmy would be a nice duo IMO but I'm not sold on the Heat.  With that all being said, adding Russell Westbrook, regardless of fit, throws either team into conference title contender talk."
Westbrook was the problem all along. Billy is a good coach but Westbrook is uncoachable. Watch Billy take a team of kids to the playoffs when Russell leaves thunder(fingers crossed)
"I absolutely agree with the points made here.  Russell Westbrook not only is a great player, but he's box office and contending teams will be definitely be willing to part with picks and young players to bolster their roster and put more people in the stands.  The NBA is a business first and foremost.  It looks like Miami might be the favorite to land him.  They'll most likely need a 3rd team to pull it off.  I don't subscribe to this idea that he and Butler wouldn't work.  A team wielding Butler and Westbrook would certainly be a top 2 or 3 team in the weaker East."

Except for when even the players themselves single you out   [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/15/russell-westbrook-fan-abuse-utah-jazz-racist](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/15/russell-westbrook-fan-abuse-utah-jazz-racist)
"If/When Russell Westbrook gets his load managed, will the headline be Russell Restbrook?"
I think the headline would be Russell Westbrook traded but that’s just a guess
"Russell Westbrook, acording to half this sub"
"That's fair. It's hard to know what a desperate owner would do. You'd like to think the picks wouldn't be worth that much if everything works out.  I saw ESPN with this trade idea today which is kind of on a whole other spectrum. Doesn't seem like enough but I guess it depends on how much of an albatross of a contract GM's feel Westbrook is  Suns get: Russell Westbrook  Thunder get: Guard Tyler Johnson, forward Kelly Oubre Jr. (via sign-and-trade), center Aron Baynes, 2022 first-round pick (lottery protected, otherwise converts to second-round picks in 2022 and 2023)"
"He does. I'd expect him to decline it if he has even a halfway decent year. Westbrook has a player option too, I dunno how likely it is that 34 year old Russell Westbrook will decline his 47 million dollar contract, though. Hard to say 4 years out."
There’s no mental gymnastics here — Russell Westbrook is unequivocally a negative asset.
"I worked out the salary  Heat receive: Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, JR Smith  Cavs receive: Justice Winslow, James Johnson, 2020 2nd, 2021 2nd  Thunder receive: Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk, Tyler Herro, 2025 1st"
I love how unrestricted this sub is when it comes to posting but this is the one thing I wouldn't mind if the mods consider adjusting it. Other wise we are promoting people's BS like that one guy who said his friend told him the Russell Westbrook trade to the Heat is done
"It would be interesting to see Russell Westbrook end up with the Pistons. Seeing him Griffin, Drummond and D-Rose play together would create some excitement! They'd be a competitive team."
"They talk about this in the article. It actually rewards players who get to more shots.  &gt;So when I cited Gobert’s numbers earlier in this article, for instance, the most impressive part was not that opponents shot poorly against him, although that helped the Jazz, of course. Rather, it was that he was the nearest defender on so many shots: about 26 shots per 100 possessions that he was on the floor last year1 as compared with a league average of about 17 shots defended per 100 possessions. By contrast, Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook — whom DRAYMOND regards as being vastly overrated by other defensive metrics — was the nearest defender on only 12 shots per 100 possessions. Some of this has to do with Westbrook’s and Gobert’s respective positions — centers naturally defend more shots than guards do, a factor that DRAYMOND corrects for (see below). But even accounting for that, it’s clear that some players are much more impactful defenders than others."
"WEST:  1. Jazz (only concern is Conley's injury history, but look forward to Mitchell getting even better now that he doesn't have to carry the entire offensive load)  2. Nuggets (could be #1 if Murray becomes an all-star, but I'm skeptical)  3. Rockets (assuming they have average injury luck instead of the disastrous luck of last year)  4. Clippers (a.k.a. ""Load Management: The Team"" lol)  5. Lakers (this team will struggle when AD is injured)  6. Spurs (nobody's talking about them, but they acquired some nice pieces, and will get Dejounte Murray back)  7. Trailblazers (I don't like their offseason moves)  8. Warriors (maybe the Curry/Russell backcourt will surprise me, but I expect them to struggle until Klay gets back; will be a force in the playoffs, though)  9. Mavericks (it'll take some time for this completely new team to gel, but before they started tanking last season, they were in the playoff hunt with a much worse team than this one)  10. Kings (I really like the Kings but the West is just brutal; they're probably going to need Fox to make the leap to all-NBA or so to get into the playoffs)  11. Pelicans (if Zion lives up to the hype I could see them higher, but I have concerns about their spacing, or lack thereof)  12. Timberwolves (so you guys are going to trade for D'Angelo at the deadline, right?)  13. Suns (they finally got a point guard; unfortunately he can't shoot)  14. Thunder (but this is more of a temporary rating since we have no idea what their team will look like when the season starts--Shai is good enough that they could make a decent run with good pieces around him)  15. Grizzlies (I love Morant and JJJ might be a future MVP, but they're only at the start of their rebuild)  EAST:  1. Bucks (losing Brogdon is a big deal and his absence will be felt hard in the playoffs, but they're still a really strong regular-season team)  2. Sixers (only not #1 because Embiid will miss a fair amount of games)  3. Celtics (I expect them to make some sort of big move by the deadline)  4. Pacers (they'll be **really** good when Oladipo gets healthy)  5. Nets (look forward to LaVert's development; their hopes of winning the title next year kind of depend on how good he becomes)  6. Heat (will take some time for the new team to gel, but if they get Westbrook, they can make serious noise in the playoffs)  7. Magic (let's all pray for Markelle's shoulder)  8. Pistons (they needed to get Blake help, and they didn't)  9. Hawks (the East is so absurdly top-heavy that they actually have an outside chance of making the playoffs, depending on Trae's development)  10. Raptors (could make the playoffs as-is, but I expect Masai to blow it up; sadly, Siakam is so good they probably can't tank harder than the East's bottom-feeders with him)  11. Wizards (free Bradley Beal!!!)  12. Knicks (the new hot take is ""actually their offseason went well,"" which I don't understand, since they should **want** to be bad)  13. Bulls (I actually *really* like their young core, but there's only so much you can do with a rookie point guard)  14. Hornets (tanking is the right strategy, but why didn't they trade Kemba before the deadline????)  15. Cavaliers (I expect Love to be traded soon; the purpose of this season is to determine which of their young point guards they want to keep)"

Which, I think is a probably does a better job for perimeter players, since in theory, DRAYMOND would ""penalize"" players for forcing the ball out of their players' hands.  Draymond also rewards players for being picked on defensively since they are comparing the points allowed to the points that would be scored when wide open."
"sir, this is russell westbrook"
Wait what. How is this getting upvotes.  I totally get why you wouldn't trade Russell Westbrook for Demar with their respective contracts - but why **wouldn't** you trade them for each other if their salaries matched?!?
Westbrook is the complete opposite of the Spurs. He doesn't work hard when it doesn't benefit him and routinely takes entire plays off. His defensive consistency is abysmal and his shot selection is the worst in the NBA. Pop would have a coronary 5 games into the season.   &gt;Pop has kinda dealt with one man systems before  Lol. Yes. Let's compare Tim Duncan to Russell Westbrook. Lol

"This is one aspect of the NBA that keeps it firmly at #2 behind the NFL.  &amp;#x200B;  In football, if you draft well and have strong ownership/GM/coaching, you can be competitive on a consistent basis and give yourself a legit shot at winning big.  With hoops, you can do everything ""right"" but your young draft picks eventually decide they want to play in NY/LA/Miami.  Think about the league right now.  Kawhi, PG-13, LeBron and AD are in Los Angeles.  Steph/Klay/Dray are in the Bay Area.  KD/Kyrie are in Brooklyn.  Jimmy Butler is in Miami and Russell Westbrook may soon be joining him. The national sports media is mostly centered on the east and west coasts so they'll always try to present this geographic stratification as a good thing for the NBA.  &amp;#x200B;  I actually like the fact that players have more freedom....but their innate desire to cluster like this takes something away from the game.  Watching Dirk win a title with the Mavs actually meant something.  Watching the Spurs and Pistons win was awesome, as they put together strong rosters with the right mix of players. Now it feels like we have a league where only the ""small market"" teams need scouts/GM's/coaches.  The big coastal teams can basically just sit back and let the players migrate to them after being developed in smaller markets. You get one elite player and then two more will join him."
I will never understand why people love Russell Westbrook. If he's a top 5 or tip 10 player. Why is he 35th in player efficiency.
&gt;LAKERS RECEIVE:  Russell Westbrook  THUNDER RECEIVE:  LeBron James  I'd love this.
"he missed like 10 games lmao all because of leg related issues...oh no he didn't dunk as much as last year. lolol. yall don't even think shit through sometimes. for a week after he came back from the sprained ankle, he looked like it wasn't ready. of course he wasn't dunking.  LISTEN TO YOURSELVESSSS (and also just admit you don't watch russell westbrook play basketball)"
"57 dunks in a year to 33 isn’t normal, and of the 33 he got, the majority were wide open two handers.  we’re not going to sit here and act like russell westbrook’s offensive arsenal isn’t built around attacking the rim &amp; playing above it. harden’s isn’t, lebron’s big enough to keep running through defenders  this shit is affecting his layups, and during the portland series he passed up opportunities to attack the rim.   so if he can’t confidently attack the rim, his game and the entire team suffers, all he has to fall back on a broken jumpshot..   we going to act like russell westbrook didn’t look flat out terrible on offense now? 17-18 russ is night and day compared to this."
"he's 30 of course he's lost some vertical leap.  this is what i don't get about the russ criticism -- some of the shit is so common sense but you guys make it a thing only he will be affected by. lebron doesn't have the same leap. harden doesnt. paul george doesnt. what 30 year old, other than gerald green, is still jumping out the gym?  you barely even want to dunk at this stage for sake of preservation. why is this a russell westbrook issue?"
Pat Riley: *You will marry Russell Westbrook and that will be the end of it*
"Russell Westbrook shot 34% from 3 post-ASB to the playoffs. Is it it fantastic? No. It's 1% below average. If Russ can get 34-36% this upcoming season, then that will work."
Unpopular Opinion: Russell Westbrook is a cancer to any team trying to win a championship. Go ahead and down vote me but it's true.
"I came into this thinking that Russell Westbrook was un-tradeable. I'm coming out of it thinking that Detroit, Charlotte, Orlando, Minnesota, and Chicago are about to go to war for his services, with Phoenix and Cleveland also sniffing around."
"You missed one  How do you think OKC could go about trading for Russ? I was thinking something like:  **OKC RECIEVES:**  Russell Westbrook  **OKC RECIEVES:**  Russell Westbrook  OKC probably wouldn't bite - Russ doesn't really open a new window for them, and they're presumably trying to retool anyway - but OKC get proper, star-power-level return for Russ. Can't complain about that."
I’m incredibly happy that this stat stuffing ball hog who can’t shoot to save his life is not going to be Detroit’s problem.   Fuck Russell Westbrook.
We're trying to trade for Russell Westbrook who has shot under 40% in the playoffs for the last three seasons.

Paul George literally had his best year ever last year playing with Russell Westbrook allo?
"I completely disagree, this was a good move to make, Sam Presti is a great GM and should be given the chance to rebuild this organization. With the assets the Thunder have, I  don't think it will take as long as fans think.  Paul George is cool and all but he can't be the face of a franchise, he is injury prone and inconsistent. Russell Westbrook simply doesn't have the tools, mentally and physically to compete **efficiently** in the current NBA. Im, sure he can get better, but again he can not be the best player on a championship team.   &amp;#x200B;  They should also look for a fresh coach, Donovan sucks donkey balls"

Russell Westbrook is pretty similar athletically.
The way that announcer said Russell Westbrook is just beautiful   This is a great clip. Russ is so entertaining.
I can’t even believe this Dirk comparison to Russell Westbrook. In 2011 Dirk was unguardable. Lebron was too short to guard him and Nobody as tall as him could match his savvy in the post. He killed prime Ibaka he killed bosh/udonis Haslem. He killed Aldridge. Only person that made Dirk uncomfortable that year was nick Collision which is funky but he played Dirk good in the post. Point being... Westbrook has no facet in his game that’s “unguardable.. he’s either hitting that pull up midrange or he’s not and a lot of the times he’s not. Westbrook is in his own way and the managers have to know that. Durant walked away from him for a reason that was more than chasing rings. Paul George had an MVP caliber season and walked away. Westbrook needs to play second superstar somewhere and be okay with it. Imagine if he joined the bucks and become less ball dominant and exploded in transition and was top dog defensively. He needs to let another superstar initiate things 70/80 % of the time for him to win a championship.
typical russell westbrook  game him breaking his back getting a triple double to barely win
"Russell Westbrook   Klay Thompson   Bojan Bogdanovic   Draymond Green   Myles Turner    Bench of Terrence Ross, Buddy Hield, Patrick Beverly as your 6-7-8 guys.  I think this team would be absolutely lethal - like 60+ games won easily. You maximize Russ’ strengths in Odense by allowing him to handle the ball and pick apart defenses with passing to shooters while having open lanes to drive to the hoop while still providing him with some touches on the perimeter which should be wide open.   On defense you have Green and Turner as anchors that allow Russ to be opportunistic and play passing lanes for steals but you have Klay and Beverley as insurance on that side as well.  Obviously the money would not work out here but I think this is the type of team Russ needs around him. Even with a worse center than Myles Turner or a weaker shooter as a backup 2 than Buddy, this team is a huge favorite."
No team is winning a title with Russell Westbrook
"James Harden yelled, “There you go!” Kendrick Perkins gave a look of mild surprise. Serge Ibaka belted, “We had a fucking squad then.” And before Russell Westbrook hit the exit door, ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him &amp; said, “We look so different.”"

"Not sure what you mean. Russell Westbrook as 3rd option would definitely be a good addition. His efficiency would definitely go up, and a team with 3 essentially the three most unguardable players in the league when they are motivated would be a pretty tough out in the playoffs. This would essentially be a superior version of the big 3 Heat. I'm not a Westbrook fan at all, but assuming you can get him to take a step back from controlling the ball all the time and....move around when he doesn't have the ball (I know this is a big ask) would be deadly."

Around the Thunder, you hear whispers about Russ being wholly devoted to Nina -- which counts as unique in NBA circles.  &gt;He has never shaved. At least, that's his claim. ""I have never shaved a day in my life,"" he told Maxim in 2015. ""I just don't really grow facial hair.""  &gt;He often listens to Katy Perry and Taylor Swift before games. ""It's good s---,"" he said. And he always uses standard iPhone earbuds.  There's so many good ones that it's hard to pick."
"2013, injury- Russell Westbrook, knee. 2014, Ibaka was injured for the last two games against the Spurs else that series goes to 7 in all-time memorable matchup. 2015, injury- Kevin Durant, foot.

Russell Westbrook is an elite playmaker
"This is such a stupid take, even Skip Bayless would call it dumb.    You’re cherry picking to solidify an awful opinion. Russell Westbrook was an incredibly vital piece to the Thunder going to the conference finals all 4 times. Plus, it’s not like Lillard is doing this single-handedly. C.J. McCollum is just as vital to their success as Dame. In the playoffs this year, Dame averaged 2.2 points per game more than CJ.    And if you really wanna narrow it down to the last 2 years, Portland’s season ended in 2018 by being swept in the first round by the Pelicans, then in 2019 it ended by being swept by Golden State. So it’s not like they’ve had tremendous outcomes compared to OKC.    I shouldn’t even be arguing with you, but your opinion on this is literally too stupid to leave alone and let live."
You made some beautiful points but OP doesnt want to hear it lol  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/nba-insider-tom-haberstroh/rockets-russell-westbrook-gamble-wont-end-well
No.    John Wall: Injury  Chris Paul: Age. Should never had gotten it.  Russell Westbrook: One way high usage player that can’t hit threes in a position that demands it.
"Curry is not ""proven"" during the NBA Finals. Finals Curry, Elimination game Harden, Russell ""Can't get out of the first round without KD"" Westbrook are superstars that have proven we can't rely on them during some parts of the post season."
Lmao that's always been bullshit. I'll have you know you're talking about my boy Rockets legend Russell Westbrook. And literally none of us were mad about that.
"Russell Westbrook is like Gordon Ramsay in the sense that, even if you’re pissed at him, you’re just gonna shut the fuck up."
"Idk how to feel about this. I live OK so I really like OKC thunder and Russell Westbrook, but my favorite team is the Houston Rockets (used to live there) . Lots of mixed feeling here"
Russell Westbrook isn’t a bad contract. He’s a top 10 player and sells out stadiums. Not every player is going bring home a title. He’s still in his prime for the next 2 seasons. cut it out with the Westbrook hate. Guy plays every game and gets his teams in the playoffs and was apart of playoff runs.
"also, I recommend watching players' highlights from previous years to understand how good these guys are.  Idk how long you've cursory followed the NBA, but for the Modern NBA age I'd begin reading season review from 2010 onwards. You seem pretty enthusiastic so, i'll try to give a synopsis of the past 8-9 years   In 2010 the Lakers and Celtics, greatest rivalry in the NBA, faced off in the NBA finals. The series went to the max 7 games, and the Lakers beat the Celtics for their second straight championship (back to back). Kobe Bryant won his 5th NBA championship and was named finals MVP (best player of the series). The Lakers and Celtics are the NBA's largest superpowers and two most historic/storied franchises.  However, that summer the entire NBA would change. The best player in the world, 2x reigning MVP, LeBron James decided to 'take his talents to South Beach' in an unprecedented power move via the televised event 'The Decision'. LeBron decided to form a team through free agency, teaming up with his great friend Dwyane Wade (3rd best player in the NBA) and fellow all-star Chris Bosh. The Heat were the most reviled team in the NBA, and were expected to waltz to a ring. However, in 2011 a young star emerged, Derrick Rose. Rose led the Chicago Bulls to the #1 seed in the eastern conference and won MVP. Nonetheless, LeBron choked in the 2011 finals, and Dirk Nowitzki led the Dallas Mavericks to surprise championship with an amazing NBA finals and playoff run.  In 2012 Miami looked like the dominant team again, obtaining the best record in the Eastern conference. LeBron James easily won his 3rd MVP, and Kevin Durant finished second. Additionally, in 2012 the OKC thunder finally emerged as a contender. They were led by 23 year old superstar Kevin Durant (KD), 23 year old all-star Russell Westbrook, and a future star James Harden. During the 1st round, Derrick Rose tore his acl vs the Philadelphia 76ers. The injury would set Rose back years and he was never the player he was before the injury. In the conference finals, the Heat faced elimination in game 6 away vs Boston. LeBron put on an all-time great performance to clinch victory and force a game 7, which the heat won. Conversely, OKC emerged as a young super team, beating the spurs in a close 6 game series. The heat would vanquish the thunder in 5 games in the NBA finals, with a blowout in game 5. LeBron would win his 1st ring and claim finals MVP.  In 2013, arguably the most consequential move in the modern nba occurred. During the off-season, the OKC Thunder traded young talent James Harden to the Rockets for picks. Also, the Lakers attempted to create a super team by adding Dwight Howard and Steve Nash to their team with Kobe. During the season, LeBron stamped his mark as the games best player. He won his 4th MVP, and had one of the most dominant seasons of all-time. The Heat won 27 straight games at one point. In the West, OKC and the Spurs were dominant forces. The Lakers had flopped as a super team, but Kobe's heroics had buoyed the Lakers to a playoff seed. Nonetheless, Kobe tore his achilles at the end of the season vs Golden State. In the playoffs, OKC's hopes were dashed during the 1st round. Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus on a controversial play, after he crashed into Patrick Beverly of the Houston Rockets. Westbrook would miss the rest of the playoffs and the Thunder lost to the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizzlies were known for their grit-n-grind play, emphasizing slower offensive possesions and tough physical defense. As the Heat made their way through the east (they had a great ecf series with the pacers), the consistent San Antonio Spurs did the same in the West. The Spurs are one of the greatest dynasties in American sports. Helmed by the greatest coach ever, Greg Poppovich, and the legendary Tim Duncan, the Spurs never won less than 50 games from 1999 to 2013. The Spurs were a machine. In arguably the greatest NBA finals of all-time, the Spurs had a chance to clinch the title in game 6. Now old, Tim Duncan had turned back the clock in the first half with an amazing performance to give the Spurs a comfortable lead. During the 4th quarter, LeBron James went on the charge and took over the game. He willed the Heat back from their deficit. However, the Spurs were still up 4 with 37 sec left. In the ensuing drama (you must watch it) the Heat came back, and Ray Allen hit arguably the clutches shot ever to keep Miami's hopes alive. LeBron would then take over game 7 leading Miami to their 2nd straight title and his 2nd finals MVP. (I'm serious, Heat vs Spurs 2013 is one of the greatest NBA series ever)  In 2014, KD won his first MVP. With Westbrook hurt, KD carried the Thunder to the 2nd best record in the West. LeBron was still the NBA's best player, but the Heat's deep playoff runs were taking a toll and Wade had substantially declined over the past few years. The Spurs, however, were merciless in their pursuit of a 5th championship since 1999. The met the Heat for a rematch and played arguably the greatest basketball ever, destroying the Heat in games 3-5. Budding star Kawhi Leonard was named finals MVP.  In 2015, the NBA changed permanently and a new superstar left his indelible mark on the NBA. During the offseason, LeBron decided to go back home and return to Cleveland. He formed a superteam with young all-star Kyrie Irving and all-star Kevin Love. The cavs had arguably the greatest luck ever in the lottery, and had back to back #1 picks in the NBA draft. They traded Anthony Bennet (a bust) and Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love, a 20 points and 10 rebs machine on the timberwolves. The Cavs would have an up and down season, with LeBron missing time due to a back injury. However, they would make the playoffs and led by the King, make the finals. In the West, a revolution occurred. The young talented Golden State Warriors hired Steve Kerr as head coach. Kerr transformed the Warriors and they emerged as the best team in the NBA (67 wins) during the regular season. Stephen Curry, Skyfucker, transformed the NBA into a simple math fact: 3&gt;2. He won MVP and made the most 3s ever in a season. His fellow splash brother Klay Thompson was an all-star and a new young combative defensive anchor Draymond Green anchored the warriors. They faced off against LeBron's cavs in the 2015 finals. Kevin Love was hurt against the celtics and missed the finals. Kyrie Irving injured himself during game 1 and was out for the series. Essentially, the series became LeBron vs the Warriors. LeBron did everything and led the Cavs to a 2-1 lead vs golden state. However, the firepower of golden state was too much and they beat the cavs in 6 games. Andre Iguodala, LeBron's primary defender, was controversially named finals MVP.  In 2016, the NBA season was all about the Warriors. Steph Curry took his 3pt shooting prowess to 5 levels higher and drained 400 3s. The Warriors won an NBA record 73 games including a legendary thriller vs OKC (watch this game). Also in the west, the Spurs still remained supreme. They won 67 games and were led by superstar Kawhi Leonard. The Thunder were finally fully healthy, as KD had finally recovered from a jones fracture injury that plagued him for 2 years. The Cavs marched to the finals in the East, led by King James and a much improved Irving and Love. In the West, the Thunder beat the spurs in a tight 6 game series (western conference semi finals). The moved on to face the warriors in the conference finals. During the wcf, the Thunder took a 3 game lead against the warriors. Draymond Green kicked Steven Adams in the balls a few time, but wasn't suspended. In game 5 the Warriors won at home. In game 6, the Thunder looked to finish the Warriors off. They held sizeable lead, but the Splash Brothers, especially Klay Thompson kept the Warriors in it. His 41 pts and 11 3pters along with Curry's  31 points finished off their comeback and forced a game 7. In game 7, Curry performed like an MVP and the Warriors overcame a 3-1 deficit to reach their second straight NBA finals. The Warriors were now attempting to finish the greatest NBA season of all-time. The 3-1 blown lead by the Thunder would become a huge storyline in the future. In the NBA finals (another must watch) the Cavs looked for revenge. However, the Warriors ran out to a 3-1 lead and all hope looked lost for Cleveland. During game 4, Draymond Green had slapped LeBron in the dick, and was suspended for an accumulation of flagrant foul points. He would miss game 5. In game 5, LeBron and Kyrie put up legendary performances, each scoring 41 points and answering everything the Warriors had. The series was now 3-2 heading back to cleveland. In game 6, the Cavs ran off to a massive lead. LeBron was running the show; scoring, assisting, rebounding, and playing fabulous defense. He scored 41 points again an added 11 rebounds and 8 assists. The series was heading back to Oracle Arena (gsw' home) for the pivotal game 7. Game 7 was a close game that came down to the last few min. It was a battle of attrition for two fatigued teams. With the game tied, the Warriors got a rebound and were quickly on the fastbreak. Curry threaded a pass to Iguodala, but LeBron came out of nowhere to block it. Then, Kyrie Irving hit a fade-away 3 to put the Cavs up by 3. Kevin Love then stopped Curry and forced him into an awful 3pter, which he missed. The Cavs ended clevelands curse, and won the 2016 finals. LeBron was named finals MVP. He led the NBA finals in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks; he's the only player to ever do so in an NBA finals. The Warriors blew a 3-1 lead, but their biggest prize was coming. After game 7, Draymond Green sat in the Oracle parking lot and made a phone call to one Kevin Durant, asking him to join the Warriors during free agency.  During 2016 free agency, the NBA had a new TV deal, so the salary cap increased substantially. In pursuit of the hardest road, KD joined GSW."
not better creators than russell westbrook.
what point are you talking about?!?! lol Russell Westbrook is where he wants to be that's who won.
"I have been wanting this for years. Harden on one side, Westbrook on the other. It's like NBA Jams. Westbrook/Harden/Capela vs James/AD/Kuzma vs Leonard/George/? vs Curry/Russell/Green vs Williamson/Ball/Holiday."
Russell Westbrook won him and James are like best friends
"NBA Usage Rate Leaders  1.) James Harden - 40.9%  10.) Russell Westbrook - 30.1%  Good luck, Rockets!"
"There is free agency, trades, and the draft. Free Agency occurs when a player's contract ends, either by contract running its course of time ( ""x"" amount of years) or the player or team opt out of the contract (Through player options and team options. Trades occur when a player is still under contract with a team, and the player along with his contract are traded to a different team. In the Westbrook situation, OKC sent Russell Westbrook (and his contract) to Houston. Houston sent Chris Paul (and his contract) to OKC alongside several future draft picks. The Draft occurs annually, and it is where teams may select players (who are not yet in the NBA) to join their teams.   The best way I could describe Free Agency is like Aaron Ramsey joining Juve. His contract at Arsenal ended, so he joined Juventus.  A ""Trade"" in futbol doesn't really ever happen, but an example could be If PSG ""traded"" Neymar to Barca and Barca sent PSG money and a player (Coutinho)  Hopefully this helps"
"Westbrook won't be the first number retired -- that honor went to Nick Collison -- but he will be the first statue. He's the franchise player, the one who stayed, the purified representation of the Thunder's first chapter in Oklahoma City. The highs, the lows, the drama, the tragedy, the beauty, the success, the failure -- he'd been there for all of it.  It will be Russell Westbrook Day tomorrow, and all the days after, but it's also a new day for the Thunder, and the chance to finally start again."
Kinda wild to think that Russell Westbrook got traded for a middle schooler.
Sonics great Russell Westbrook?
I never said that the Rockets offense is a bad one. In my opinion it was quite a good system and it worked really well in 2018. I'm saying that Russell Westbrook does not have the same skillset as Chris Paul so the Rockets will have to find a new scheme to incorporate these two players.
God Damn I can not describe how much this hurts. Russell Westbrook is Oklahoma City.
I would like him to try this to Russell Westbrook
"Or that Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook played on their team at the same time."
"&gt; If the Rockets trade for Russell Westbrook, I'll tattoo his MVP season averages on my face."
Harden and Westbrook on the same team again. I wonder how Harden feels about losing Paul for Russell.
"“I am, inevitable.”  “And I am Russell Westbrook”"
What the fuck I love Russell Westbrook
Of all days he had to do this on Russell Westbrook day.
Third? Russell Harden  Fourth? James Westbrook
I can’t believe Russell Westbrook is on my team
"I’m just playing devils advocate I’d give anything to have Russell Westbrook for 10 years. (a young Russ, not Russ right now)   And with that young roster of KD, Russ and Harden, you can’t help but be disappointed that they never got a championship. That’s why I say limited playoff success"
Waved 👋🏻👋🏻 to the entire OKC team.   Cold-blooded. The Thunder have literally never played a game in their history without Russell Westbrook on their team. End of a goddamn era.
Most GM’s don’t have Paul George and Russell Westbrook to trade for a shitload of picks
Russell Westbrook is .. good?
"I guess it's because ""the league changed"". There's a new narrative, it's all about advance statistics and proficient shooting and Westbrook doesn't shine so brightly under that light.   I think he would be more appreciated if he accomplished his feats ten years earlier. It's just a matter of timing. It's the same reason Bill Russell isn't lauded for his accomplishments as the best ever, his era is completely irrelevant today.  There will come a day when Jordan will be called ""overrated"", well, that's my opinion."
KD left because he wanted to win man. He had a better opportunity with the best regular season team in NBA history. Here's proof https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/russell-westbrook-wasnt-reason-kevin-durant-left-thunder-says-ex-teammate  Don't just make shit up to fit your narrative.  Who was KD playing with when he won his scoring titles? What about when he won his MVP? Who was Paul George playing with when he entered MVP contention for the first time? You're bending the facts to try and make an incorrect point.   Oladipo and Harden are terrible examples because they weren't fully developed stars when they left OKC. Harden was coming off the bench lmao of course he scored more when he left.
This is my favorite  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant
Harden is no nephew: confirmed. Russell Westbrook is the hottest dude.

"&gt; Lol insinuating that KD left OKC cause of Russ is ridiculous and revisionist history.  KD wanted to play a different style of ball. A style you can't play with Russell Westbrook.  &gt; PG signed a 5 year extension to play with Russ and then jumped ship because he saw a better opportunity to win a title with one of the best players in the NBA.  Yep, a best player who is not Russell Westbrook. After getting bounced in the first round and a whole season of Russ underperforming.  &gt; Russ is always lauded as a great teamate and every star has played better with him  No, we just established this isn't the case. Durant had his best seasons while Russ was injured and while on the Warriors. Oladipo's career took off after he left. Harden's career took off after he left. George had his best season as Westbrook declined and still left for greener pastures after a frustrating first round exit. If we're talking best season in terms of team success, George took Pacer teams further as the lone star than he and Westbrook could take the Thunder together.   &gt; And why can't he play with the ball in his hands in Houston? He won't be an off-ball player. It's not like the guy with the ball has to take the shot. It also offers the possibility of having either Russ or Harden on the floor basically at all times, they don't have to always play together.  He can have the ball sometimes. He can drive the offense while Harden plays off ball. He can drive the offense while Harden's on the bench. And he can do a really good job of it. I'm not saying the Rockets won't get any utility out of him. But the Rockets like to play with the ball in Harden's hands as much as possible, and when that's happening, Russ's usefulness will be extremely limited. And I think the playoffs have shown three years in a row now that Russ's usefulness is limited when teams get to prep for him."
"[https://twitter.com/espn\_macmahon/status/1149484990104608768](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1149484990104608768)  &amp;#x200B;  [**Tim MacMahon‏Verified account** @**espn\_macmahon**](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon)  James Harden was a driving force in this deal, I’m told.

"James Harden Russell Westbrook is actually an anagram for ""joker albatrosses underwhelms""."
Fuck Russell Westbrook. Welcome to Houston.
"&gt;he thinks the Paul contract is better  Because it is shorter, i get that you're a OKC and Westbrook fan but you need to put your opinions on the player aside. He didnt say the basketball player Chris Paul is better than the basketball player Russell Westbrook. What he said was to paraphrase   3 years/125 million is less bad than 4 years 160 million"
"Now imagine if OKC uses those new picks to get someone as good as say Kevin Durant, James Harden, or Russell Westbrook?  A team would be lucky to get one of those guys with those picks.  Imagine how good they could be."
"You really take Westbrook/Harden/House/Tucker/Capela over Curry/Russell/Klay/Draymond/Looney? And the same for Simmons/Richardson/Harris/Horford/Embiid? And same for Bledsoe/Antetekounmpo/Middleton/Ilyasova/Brook? I'd easily take any of those 3 over the rockets, I get not believing in Brogdon/Oladipo/Warren/Leaf/Turner since I'm specifically in favor of them, but come on man"

Houston reunites Harden and Westbrook creating the best backcourt in the NBA. Westbrook’s fast style of play fits well in D’Antoni’s system and (knock on wood) he is way more durable than Paul.  OKC will have to try to deal out Paul, as someone as competitive as CP3 would not want to be tank commander. The roster with Paul would be interesting, as CP3, Adams and Gallinari are all chippy, fiery competitors. Defensively they would be in the upper echelon of the league. The future assets they would receive would be enough to lose Westbrook.  ...  Good job"
"On Monday, ""sources told me that Russell Westbrook has been traded to the Heat."""
"My b, I was looking at their contracts [here](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/russell-westbrook-6141/) and [here](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/chris-paul-2609/). Probably should have checked their birthdays, but the point still stands."
"Well, we can only go by the past and the present. Lowe has, in my opinion, been undervaluing Russell Westbrook."
The [HOU] Russell Westbrook flair during the playoffs will be what you’re looking for. Then switch to [OKC] Shai Gilgeous-Alexander during next years draft. You’re welcome

Russell Westbrook could beat half the men in the NFL.
"Alternative title, Russell Westbrook &amp; James Harden off-season prep begins."
"Yeah, and Russ is worth the money till he isn't. They would've been paying CP3 the same amount until 2022. Russ is only under contract for one more year. The one extra year does not make that much of a difference  Would you rather be paying a 30 year old Russell Westbrook that amount, or a 34 year old CP3?  It's entirely worth it if they can compete for a championship, and I don't see why they won't next year."
"This take needs to stop being regurgitated.  Harden doesnt need someone to play off the ball, the whole point of bringing cp3 in was to have someone take ball handling responsibilities away from him at times so he wouldn't have to dominate the ball every possession. Cp3 failed at that.  Russell Westbrook will not."
"I can 100% confirm Russell Westbrook does not browse reddit. Man was strongly disliked by Houston fans, to say the least."
"How does Russell Westbrook fit into the Houston Rockets style at all? Russell is like a sub 30% shooter from 3, and takes a ton of midrange jumpers."
Russell Westbrook is the new Snake ?!?@
But he's coming to Harden's team now. Russ is a very very good player when he takes his foot off the gas and becomes the 2nd option. Him taking a step back allowed PG to enter the MVP discussion.  Russell Westbrook&gt;CP3 and it's not even close at this point. How is it a lateral move?
"Omg I didn't even think about this.  Russell Westbrook playing in a Mike D'antoni offense...  Wow...  He's going to break records for shot attempts in a season, and no one is ever going to break it after him."
youre crazy for not being able to think of more characters and thus you had to repeat part of russell westbrook again
"Pretty sure the consensus in the NBA is that Russell Westbrook isn’t worth $40 million a year, but here we are."
"https://mobile.twitter.com/realskipbayless/status/967072459689140224?lang=en  &gt; Russell Westbrook has become the best clutch shooter in basketball, and it's really not even close.  &gt; ""The Oklahoma City Thunder are a much bigger threat to the Golden State Warriors than the Houston Rockets are.”"
"Neph, Russell Westbrook is not a better fucking defender than Chris Paul. Stop that shit."
Difference being Chris Paul is one of the most intelligent players in the league and Russell Westbrook is total bonehead who I don't trust to figure it out.
Russell Westbrook is self aware not like Aritificial Intelligence I mean he is self aware he understands perception and sometimes jokingly plays into it I believe he will be a changed man in Houston this is his REDEMPTION ARC

It’s more so how tf does a Harden and Westbrook back court Work? Russell can’t move off the ball at all and Harden doesn’t either. They just gone pass each other the ball and iso all game?
Turns out Paul George and Russell Westbrook will net you more assets than Jrue Holliday and Evan Turner. That being said Presti has done a phenomenal job and has set the Thunder up beautifully
Russell Westbrook is the most unselfish PG in the league and he actually gets depressed whenever he has to get a triple double.   ^Am ^I ^doing ^this ^right?

"&gt;Did the team perform to expectations?  No. With PG's new deal along with the pick up of Markieff Morris, Nerlens Noel and Dennis Schroder they were expected to make it to the second round of playoffs at least.   &gt;Why did they fall short of/meet/exceed expectations?  Several things but mainly:  - Billy Donovan bad coaching decisions. Timeouts, rotations and player welfare.  - Russell Westbrook careless decision making on plays and preference of playing ISO ball.  - Didn't win enough games to gain home court advantage.   &gt;What were the highlights of the season?  - First half of the season before the All Stars break.  - PG with 4 go-ahead scores against the Nets, 76ers, Jazz and Rockets.   &gt;What were the lowlights of the season?

PG, Adams, Grant and Fergusson.  &gt;Which players disappointed you?  Westbrook, Noel, Morris.   &gt;What offseason moves do they need to make (draft selections, trades, free agent signings, staff changes etc.)?  Westbrook, Roberson and Morris to be traded.   &gt;Who is set to break out next season?  Fergusson and Diallo.   &gt;Who is set to regress next season?

Russell Westbrook meniscus tear in 2013
Well Russell Westbrook was an mvp two years ago  Is STILL averaging a triple double  Doesn’t miss 20-30 games a year  Is 4 years younger  And cp3 has declined HARD with all of his injuries...  Why the hell is this a question at all?
"Klay was great, but he has it way easier than Steph, and is able to play with less defensive attention because of how much of the defensive attention is out on Steph.  Draymond of course wasn’t close to deserving it. Was inconsistent on defense game to game and turned it over like he was Russell Westbrook."
"Sure, but he's one of the worst salaries around relative to role.  He was like 54th among PGs in RPM, has advanced numbers similar to 2018 Melo, doesn't pass well, is awful on defense, and still has an assault charge.  http://bkref.com/tiny/DvINv  He's sub replacement level in BPM, was about as efficient as Melo and really didn't do much.  I get OKC fans seem to think he's a good backup, but he's at best a middling backup paid closer to starters money.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2840764-5-worst-contracts-still-on-the-books-from-ridiculous-2016-free-agency#slide0  &gt;Dennis Schroder has already been traded on his current contract, but he's far from a net-neutral asset. Acquiring him is different when you're an Oklahoma City Thunder squad trying to cut your repeater-tax bill and find a new home for Carmelo Anthony's bloated salary.  This past season is hardly a ringing endorsement for Schroder's price point over the next two years. He was wildly inconsistent, both a force and a farce. Perhaps the crowning example of his unpredictability: He tallied 20 or more points on 21 occasions but failed to crack double digits 14 times.  Schroder did not buy the Thunder spells without Paul George and Russell Westbrook. Their offensive rating of 100.8 with him running the show on his own ranked in the 3rd percentile. Westbrook didn't fare any better through his me time, but that's not exactly a good defense.  Oklahoma City obliterated opponents in the almost 1,500 possessions all three played together. That is both encouraging and tenuous. Schroder and Westbrook proved an awkward match when paired up without George, which suggests a certain fragility to the trio's returns.  Both Schroder and Westbrook need to improve their outside clips if they're going to be more of a natural fit. Schroder specifically shot 34.1 percent from beyond the arc (the second-highest mark of his career), but he trailed off after the All-Star break. His three-point success rate fell to 30.9 percent over Oklahoma City's final 25 regular-season games and to 30.0 percent in the playoffs.  Even when Schroder is making threes, he's subsisting on set looks. That's fine. It has value. But he's not a reliable off-the-dribble threat. His 42.8 effective field-goal percentage on pull-up jumpers was far from elite, he shot a career-low 52.0 percent at the rim and his ball control out of the pick-and-roll left a lot to be desired.  Topsy-turviness is part of the Schroder experience. Teams can by and large afford to house that inconsistency in the second unit. Going on 26, he's still relatively young and hopes to improve his off-the-bounce shooting, per The Athletic's Brett Dawson.  Still, no suitor is going to consider him an answer at point guard. His deal looks a lot rosier if it comes off the books next summer. It doesn't; he is a two-year investment. The Thunder will have to attach a pick or prospect to his contract or take back a less savory pact to move him.  This is mostly what he was.  He's just kind of bad."
"Fair enough, but that can all be explained by the game evolving.  Things are just played differently today.  Russell Westbrook is not a better rebounder than Magic was, but he averages significantly more because of how the game is played now.  Sabonis was an elite passer but he played in the era of back to the basket centers and the offense being run through the point guard.  In Denver, everything runs through Jokic.  The play style is vastly different.  I'll admit, I only really got to see Sabonis play as an older player with no knees once he got to Portland, but even then you could see what an elite passer he was.  I've seen both play and I don't think you can conclusively say Jokic is a better passer after watching them."
"Wow! So, if Udonis Haslem decides to retire, then the longest tenured NBA player, who spent his entire career with one team, will be Russell Westbrook, who's been with the OKC Thunder since 2008, when it was first formed."

"It's tough to be in the West as a PG when there is Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Tony Parker, and Steve Nash all at the same time.   For as good as Baron Davis was with the Warriors, he never made an All-Star game with them because the West was that tough for PGs."

"It pains me to say this, but they should find the highest bidder for Paul George while he still has immense value, and bottom out until Russell ""5 right knee surgeries"" Westbrook and his untradeable super-crippling supermax contract expires. But maybe that's just me - I'd rather root for a surefire lottery team that has hope of improving through the draft, than a capped out perennial first round exit that has hit its ceiling."
"I disagree. The Celtics at least have Tatum and Brown to look forward to. The Thunder literally have no such prospects, they have incredibly limited path to improvement, and the decline of supermax player Russell Westbrook is only going to worsen them."
"The four biggest issues with the Thunder are Sam Presti, 31 year old Russell Westbrook falling off a cliff as a scorer (now on one of the league's three worst contracts), almost zero paths to improving the roster, and the complete lack of shooting across the roster outside of Paul George."
"He was committed to OKC in 2016 provided KD stayed. Their lineup would've been:  * PG: Russell Westbrook * SG: Andre Roberson * SF: Kevin Durant * PF: Al Horford * C: Steven Adams * Bench: Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Dion Waiters, Ersan Ilyasova, Enes Kanter  That's a LOADED team. And since they still would've had Sabonis and Oladipo, they still would've been able to trade for Paul George the following offseason."
Russell Westbrook 🤷‍♂️
"Did the team perform to expectations?  Definitely not, they played well in the regular season but they were tipped to at least make the 2nd round or possibly make the conference finals. They were a great defensive team during the regular season and there were questions about whether they would perform consistently on offense. It turns out that thier offense was their biggest letdown in the postseason once they shortened their rotation.  Why did they fall short of expextations?  I believe that if they had an efficient 3rd option on offense, they could have made it to the conference finals. We thought they had gotten that in Schroder at the start of this season but he wasn't consistent or efficient enough. I also feel that, while Westbrook definitely deferred more to his teammates in the regular season (which partly led to their success), once the postseason hit, he tried to take matters into his own hands, taking too many inefficient shots. I also feel that the absense of Andre Roberson didn't help them much, however he probably wouldn't have provided much value on the offensive end, which is what they needed.  Which player impressed you the most?  Definitely Paul George. MVP candidate throughout the season, as well as being a big part to their defebsive stability and success. Made a leap in his offensive ability after becoming the 1st option of the team, but he needed more consistency from his teammates to really reach that next level.  Which player disappointed you the most?  I'd say either Russell Westbrook or Dennis Schroder. While Westbrook did improve on the defensive end in comparison to his past few seasons, his offensive efficiency was not good at all. He did perform decently in the regular season, but we are still waiting to se Westbrook take it to the next level and become a more efficient basketball player in the postseason.  At the start of the season, most of us thought that with a lesser role, Schroder would hopefully become more efficient and be a good 3rd/4th option on offense, and be able to produce better than Raymond Felton would once Westbrook is off the court. However, the lessening of his role led to him attempting nearly 5 threes per game, which is not a good use of his talents.  Whta offseason moves do they need to make?  They need shooters. Their lack of ability to space the floor was a big reason why they underperformed on offense, and with both of their point guards getting heavy minutes and being below average shooters. Having 2 or 3 guys off the bench to come in and space the floor would allow their offense to move more freely and allow Westbrook and George to create for themselves better."
"&gt;Did the team perform to expectations?  Fuck no.  &gt;Why did they fall short of/meet/exceed expectations?  We can't shoot, terrible depth and a ton of injuries.  &gt;What were the highlights of the season?  MVdPoyG being so clutch for us throughout the season &amp; Russell's 20/20/20 game!  &gt;What were the lowlights of the season?  Having to play after the All-Star game.  &gt;Which players impressed you?  Jerami Grant: Such an underrated guy, love his effort out there even when he isn't doing great. Hope he improves his jumper even more this summer.   Terrance Ferguson: It's early but he'll get there. He's looking like a really good 3&amp;D guy (BUT IT'S 99% SURE HE WON'T BE KLAY r/Thunder) Dre has been teaching him well on the defensive end. Gotta work on the 3 point shot and putting the ball on the floor.  &gt;Which players disappointed you?  Steven Adams: This time last season I was one of the nephews believing that if Melo is gone all those shots will go to Stevo and he'll be another threat. Boy I was wrong, he can't create for himself, he'll struggle posting up many guys, can't shoot hell he can't make free throws.  Dennis Schröder: Bad shot selection and didn't really create for others. Also, how are you an NBA point guard, even starting for some seasons and can't throw a proper lob for the bigs? Makes me mad just thinking about it.  Russell Westbrook: I'm sorry fellow Thunder fans, we can't go far if teams are begging him to shoot. Yes I know he'll get hot and win you games but you can't go deep in the Playoffs.  &gt;What offseason moves do they need to make (draft selections, trades, free agent signings, staff changes etc.)?  We're fucked.  We're paying Steven Adams as if he's a top center in the league for some rebounds and tough screens.  We're paying Dennis Schröder big money to chuck everything and not create for others.  We're paying Andre Roberson good money, well obviously he got hurt but if he isn't the same anymore that contract will be impossible to move.  We're paying Patrick Patterson money.  We're still doing the same developing of young, lengthy, athletic, talent™ Presti loves instead of going after guys that can shoot, I still can't believe how you do that with Russell Westbrook as your point guard. We have no consistent 3 point threat other than George.  &gt;Who is set to break out next season?  Jerami Grant.  &gt;Who is set to regress next season?  Russell Westbrook.  &gt;What are the main concerns for next season?  Billy Donovan on the bench.  &gt;What expectations are there for next season?  Making the Playoffs."
" Well, our season is kinda hard to summarize, we had so many ups and downs, but let´s try to review it...        *Did the team perform to expectations?*        If i am honest, no. I had high hopes coming into the season but the majority of it was just dissapointing. We started out really well in the season, and since Schroder was really good as the backup PG while Russ was injured at the start of the season i thought with Russ it could only get better. And once he came back from his injury, PG had his phenomenal streak and we were playing super well, but after his injury it got worse and worse. While a lot of guys expected us to win against Portland without Nurkic in the playoffs, we just played terrible in most of the games then, so the loss was totally deserved and was the perfect example why we lost so many games post the All-Star-Weekend.   &amp;#x200B;    *Why did they fall short of/meet/exceed expectations?*    &amp;#x200B;  Part of it were injuries. Paul George played so damn well over the course of the season, and before the All-Star-Weekend he looked like the best player in the League and was a legitimate MVP candidate. But once his shoulder got injured we looked worse and worse. While Russ improved his shooting and efficiency at the end of the season, it wasn´t enough. It was clear that Paul was our best player, in offense and in defense. The second reason, for me personally the bigger one, was poor coaching. It seemed like Billy Donovan never made good adjustments over the course of the seasons, his timeouts were often questionable as well as his rotations. For example the moment he played the 3 PG lineup with Schroder, Russ and Felton together with Noel and Grant i always knew we would fuck up hard. But since our GM really likes Billy it seems like he will be there for the next season again.   &amp;#x200B;    *What were the highlights of the season?*    &amp;#x200B;   The games against Utah and San Antonio were really good and exciting, it seemed like they never wanted to end. The comeback wins against Houston,Philadelphia and the Nets were super cool, the PG Game Winners were just beautiful, but my heart always suffered a lot during these games. Another one was Russ 20/20/21 Game and averaging a triple-double for the 3rd year in a row!   &amp;#x200B;    *What were the lowlights of the season?*    &amp;#x200B;   Our stretch post the All-Star-Weekend and the Playoffs. Both were pretty abysmal and if i am honest while most guys wanted to play Portland, if i look at it now if we would have played Denver or Golden State both series would end with a clear and clean sweep...   &amp;#x200B;    *Which players impressed you?*    &amp;#x200B;  The first answer has to be Paul George. It was just beautiful to watch him play over the season. He managed to run both offense and defense super well, he always gave everything on the court, was a huge leader for the team and his game winners were just amazing, especially since he was known for not being a clutch player in his career. Who knows, maybe without his injury he could have won the MVP? But being a Top 3 player this year while making All-NBA First team + All-Defensive Team is just great. You made every OKC Fans proud Paul, i hope you can keep this level next season! The second one is Jerami Grant. He was a huge part of our defense, but his offense also improved a lot. He evolved a solid jumper, his post game also got better, even though there is still a lot of room to grow. I expect even more of him next year! Honorable mentions are Dennis Schroder and Terrance Ferguson. Both made a good jump this year. Even though their season was inconsistent, they showed that they can compete at a high level, especially Dennis.   &amp;#x200B;    *Which players disappointed you?*    &amp;#x200B;  It hurts to say, but Russell Westbrook has to be the answer. He is and always was my favourite player, and even though his stats my look good, especially with the triple-double average, he was a big part of our failure this year. Yes, he was injured at the start and at the end, but his efficiency was absolutely abysmal, his jumper and free throw percentage got worse, and it seemed like he wanted to take over every game, but missing so many open shots was just painful to watch. But since we know he can do it much better and his surgery after the playoffs was successful, i am hopeful that we will see a different Brodie next year. He also stated that his season was dissapointing and he will work on his jumper really hard this offseason. So please Russ, show us what you can next year! The second one is Steven Adams. He still doesn´t have a jumper, his free throw shooting was horrible, sometimes i thought i watch Shaq. His defense in the P/R was not good and in the playoffs he got exposed by the unplayable Kanter. While i love our Kiwi, it seems like we need to make changes at this position.   &amp;#x200B;    *What offseason moves do they need to make (draft 	selections, trades, free agent signings, staff changes etc.)?*    &amp;#x200B;  We need better shooting. That´s pretty obvious, we were one of the worst shooting teams in the league, and we need changes as soon as possible. The perfect fit would be shooting guard with good defense as well, players like Danny Green or Harrison Barnes come to my mind. The other option would be a stretch 5 like Kevin Love, Al Horford or Nikola Vucevic, but since our cap is kinda fucked and i don´t think that teams would trade Adams for these players, it´s hard to see any big free agent signings this offseason. But the biggest one is actually a change in the coaching staff. I like Billy as a guy and as a person, but it seems like coaching a college team is just the best fit for him, so me and most of the Thunder Fans want a new Head Coach for the next season.   &amp;#x200B;    *Who is set to break out next season?*    &amp;#x200B;  Jerami Grant. I fully believe that he can improve even more next season, and if he can work on his playmaking and handles a bit more, i can see him having a season like Siakam this year. So he is my player to watch out for the team, and if he can make this jump, i am hopeful it would help the team a lot.   &amp;#x200B;    *Who is set to regress next season?*    &amp;#x200B;  I don´t think we can tell it regressing, but i think it will be hard for PG13 to repeat this season again. If he can it would be awesome, but i don´t know whether or not it will happen. Another one is Andre Roberson. It seems like he will be back next season, but i don´t think we can expect him to be the Defense Anchor that he used to be back in the days. If he can prove me wrong, it would be fantastic tho.   &amp;#x200B;    *What are the main concerns for next season?*    &amp;#x200B;  Mainly that most of the western teams improved their rosters a lot. On paper our roster still looks good, but i believe we have to fight really hard to even make the playoffs.   &amp;#x200B;    *What expectations are there for next season?*       Call me delusional, but the goal is winning a title. Russ won´t play at the highest level in 4 or 5 years anymore, and Paul George still is 3 years under contract. So the window is closing even more, so we have to go all in the next two years i would say. And Russ is the player that gives everything on and off the court every day, and him winning a title would mean so much for the City, the Franchise, and all the Fans as well. It will be really hard, but why shouldn´t he have a year like Dirk back in 2011? Everything is possible, isn´t it?     &amp;#x200B;  So let´s see what happens next year!      \#ThunderUp"
They traded him to Minnesota two years after they selected him 2nd overall before Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook.
"Here's the list of players who have done this:  LeBron James 2018, 2019 James Harden 2017 Russell Westbrook 2017 Michael Jordan 1989 Oscar Robertson 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965"
"Ya, I pretty stopped listening to Cowherd because all he does is suck off Brady and Rodgers and hate on Russell Westbrook and Toronto"
&gt; You think 19 year old Russell Westbrook would have given Oklahoma a second thought?  You're right he probably would have picked LA but not for the pretty lights but because his family and friends are there. Something we'd all like to be able to choose. Just because we're not all in a position for that doesn't mean everyone should have the same problem.
"Giannis would never have even have gone to Wisconsin in the first place. Same with Russ, who also signed a deal that was only available for OKC.  You think 19 year old Russell Westbrook would have given Oklahoma a second thought?   Zion would have absolutely gone to NYC over New Orleans if he could choose. He even said he wanted to."
So that’s what driving to the basket looks like. Been a while since I saw that in a game with Russell Westbrook.
RUSSELL WESTBROOK.
"\&gt; I'm saying it wasn't a strategic choice to do that   &amp;#x200B;  We have strategically had all 5 on the glass since Kendrick Perkins was here. We set NBA records in reb % I believe in 2015-2016 in KD's last season.   &amp;#x200B;  There is nothing I can do to show you that it's concrete that Billy has this in his system. I can reference you to our rebounding numbers that date all the way back to Kendrick Perkins which might hint to how much emphasis we put on rebounding. Everyone knows a defensive possession ends with a rebound. You can't stop a team without securing the rebound.  &amp;#x200B;  \[I can link this article for ya that details his rebounding and how it helps the offense\]( [https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/2/](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/russell-westbrook-rebounding-thunder-triple-doubles-offense/2/) )  &amp;#x200B;  \*\*Brief quote from it:\*\*  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; Over the past three years, opponents have missed 508 free throws that turned into live rebounds against the Thunder. In that period, Oklahoma City as a whole has scored 526 points on those possessions for an unremarkable 103.5 offensive rating, [per pbpstats.com](https://www.pbpstats.com/possession-finder/nba?TeamId=1610612760&amp;Season=2018-19,2017-18,2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;OffDef=Offense&amp;StartType=OffFTMiss). The average team’s offense after missed free throws puts up 106.0 points per 100 possessions, for comparison.  \&gt;That number skyrockets when it’s Westbrook who gets the rebound, all the way up to 113.1, which would be good for third in the league behind Denver and Toronto. We’ve all seen the highlights of Westbrook taking in a miss and going coast-to-coast, but even if he’s unable to score immediately, the pressure he puts on a defense every time he picks up a rebound is unlike almost any other player in the league. The vast difference between Westbrook’s possessions and his team’s overall mark makes it even clearer that they should get the ball to him as early and often as possible. They simply don’t have anybody else on the team who can do what Westbrook does after a rebound.  &amp;#x200B;  \[Or this one about rebounding, positionality and transition play that isn't tied to just Westbrook but all guards in general. This one even predates his MVP run in 2016-2017.\]( [https://fansided.com/2015/09/09/rebounding-positionality-and-transition-play/](https://fansided.com/2015/09/09/rebounding-positionality-and-transition-play/))  &amp;#x200B;  It's unusual now but I fully suspect that in a couple of years that it'll change and we'll just see bigger guards play the rebounding glass a lot."
1) LeBron James**** + Anthony Davis  2) Stephen Curry** + Draymond Green  3) Paul George + Russell Westbrook*  4) Damian Lillard + C.J McCollum  5) Luka Doncic + Kristaps Porzingis  *League MVPs
Russell Westbrook easy.
"MVPs require context as they are comparative (and I also think CP3 deserved MVP that year over Kobe but I digress). As for the Finals appearance, I'd argue what the Rockets did last year was more impressive than what that Thunder team did. But it doesn't matter, because WB wasn't in his prime for that run anyway.  Prime Chris Paul was better at basketball than prime Russell Westbrook."
Why didn’t Russell Westbrook take a contract that wouldn’t cripple the Thunder for years to come financially? Money is money.
"For some people it works the other way.  No way in hell Russell Westbrook is 6'3"".  KD is also 7'2"" and was listed at 6'10"" for a long time (maybe still is)."
"His career winning percentage speaks to the kind of player he is.  In seasons where he played more than 65 games, his teams have a winning percentage of .600. For comparison, only 25 players in league history have higher than a .680 winning %, and Horford probably falls around 75th all time based on normal distributions.  His WS/48 is JUST below Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, and Dwyane Wade. It's 74th all time, and is ahead of players such as Lamarcus Aldridge, Chris Bosh, Paul Pierce, Paul George, Tracy McGrady, Patrick Ewing, and Elgin Baylor.  Anyone who looks at just his stats and tries to form an opinion honestly has no idea what they're talking about. Al Horford is a winning basketball player."
"Lol kuzma is overrated on this sub if anything. He doesn’t do much other than score, and he does it on Russell Westbrook shooting splits.   If I was the Lakers, I would have traded Kuzma and kept Ball so they would have someone who can defend all of the elite point guards in the west and (while shooting a higher percentage than Kuzma)."

Jordan Farmar, Aaron Afflalo, Darren Collison, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Ryan Hollins, Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, Jrue Holliday."
Russell Westbrook
Bill Russell Westbrook is so overrated! Everyone could stat pad rings if they got his usage rate
russell westbrook at his best is the greatest basketball player ever.
"Talking peaks is so stupid when accounting for who should be seen as a better player. Westbrook had a great mvp season, his advanced stats were off the charts and he averaged a triple double, doesn’t mean he’s better than Wade and cp3 who never won an mvp.  Similarly I doubt Bill Russell etc are better than modern day players like Shaq, Dwight, Duncan etc. because of the technology and training. But that doesn’t make them greater than him."
He would be taken down in a chase on LivePD for the murder of russell westbrook.
Bill Russell Westbrook obviously
"Rose ended up being the biggest what if, youngest MVP, carried a Bulls team to Conference championships. Was as good as russell westbrook is now at 22"
Russell Westbrook has the right body and tenacity for it.

And what about the exorbitant tax bill that OKC is gonna have when Russell Westbrook makes a bijillion dollars in a few years? Is that not real money?
Damian Lillard Steph Curry Russell Westbrook  Would be my 3 who I’d bet on
"Honestly, I just rushed through what I thought were roughly the top 8 teams in the NBA.  Given Kawhi coming to the Lakers, Lakers-Jazz-Nuggets are a wash 1-2-3 for me, Rockets-Thunder-Blazers are a wash 4-5-6, and then the next 5-6 teams are competing for the 7 and 8 seeds.  I think whoever is the best of the Rockets Thunder Blazers group will ultimately come down to health.  I personally think with the squads fully healthy the Rockets are the best of the lot, and I think Russell Westbrook will not be as dogshit in efficiency as he was last year.  Remember, Thunder were a top 3 team in the West before the Paul George injury where everything hit the shitter.  I agree in principle though, I definitely could see an argument for Blazers as being better than the Thunder 100%"

Sonics legend Russell Westbrook.
"I'd be pretty surprised if McCollum or DeRozan made it. There's a lot of other guards who are probably better or as good (Conley, Westbrook, Paul, Holiday) or on the rise (Booker, Mitchell, Russell, Fox, Murray). If Doncic is counted as a SG he also has a great shot (or as a wild card, too). I have a feeling those guard spots will go to other guys."
"Westbrook, then D'Angelo Russell"

Russell Westbrook was the leader for the Thunder.
If Russell Westbrook was on the Sixers instead of Simmons they would of won the east last year.
I saw some SL highlights earlier that featured Russell Westbrook and noticed Harden and Ibaka were on the team too. My initial thought was that had to be the greatest SL team ever considering how fast all of them developed into elite NBA talent. Turns out they didn't win a game. Lol.
 I think the best rugby player would be Russell Westbrook. He'd be a god in the pitch with a month of practice under his belt.
"What's the difference between then and now?  Aside from the fact that the players are dictating where they go to a greater degree than they once did, what's different?  The Jazz had John Stockton and Karl Malone.  How is that different from Houston having James Harden and Chris Paul?  The Sonics had Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp.  How is that different from Oklahoma City with Russell Westbrook and Paul George?  The Knicks had Patrick Ewing.  How is that different from the Bucks with Giannis?  The Magic had Shaq and Penny.  How is that different from the Sixers with Embiid and Simmons?  Do you think these players aren't on pace to be inducted into the Hall of Fame?  Not all of them will be, but then again, neither were Kemp or Penny.  At any given time in the NBA, there are about 30 HOF players at various stages of their careers.  You can turn on the TV and watch any of those players on a given night.  It isn't any different than is was, you're just remembering it differently with the benefit of hindsight."
"I get that usually who win the offensive rebounding battle wins the game, but Russell Westbrook averaged 10 rebounds for the last 3 years, it’d be a lot harder for Anthony Davis to average 10 assists."
"KD texted to say the Russell Westbrook story was fake, there's nothing to indicate that KD texted Stephen A. about his statements about Steve Kerr."
Russell Westbrook.
"DeMarcus Cousins  Russell Westbrook  James Harden -- I would want him in the sense that he's amazing and would make any team way better, but man I don't want to watch him iso for 82 games as Jaylen/Jayson just hang out in the corners"
"&gt; 39 years old Duncan was a great player  Duncan was averaging 8ppg at age 39 (his last season). Dude did not have anywhere near all-star level at that age. What are you talking about?  None of the players you mentioned had really all-star level at that age. Some made the All-Star because its really a popularity contest and people like seeing them but they didnt have the level.  Dude, MJ was shooting so bad in Washington that would have made Russell Westbrook cringe. And he was taking 20 shots a game to get his numbers.  &gt; any team with a pick on the 20's would take a chance on old man Lebron (unless he regresses greatly)   Of course he is going to regress greatly lol. At Lebron's age, MJ was Finals MVP averaging like 32 or 33 ppg in the POs. At 39 with the Wizards he could only get to 20ppg, by shooting a shit ton every game and becuse the Wizards didnt care about winning that season. Thats not going to happen with a top10 team (that will have a pick in the 20's).  &gt; Junior on the off chance that he's something  Most likely he wont even make the league (how many sons of ATGs or All-Star players have made it?)"
Russell Westbrook came off the bench for Darren Collison
"Although he never set foot in the KeyArena, I think it’s worth mentioning that Russell Westbrook was selected by the Sonics in the 2008 draft."
Russell Westbrook and not winning championships
"That's true, that he had worse TS% but also none of them were the sole shot creators expected to follow up a ROOKIE playoff series win in which he knocked out Paul George and Russell Westbrook (MVP). He was literally throwing up random dagger 3s because that was what Quin called for because they wanted to be a playoff team. Whereas the others you mentioned only had to worry about continuing their own personal development because they had nothing more expected of them.   You seem to have an extremely short term memory. Utah was supposed to be a lottery team after losing Hayward. That's what every single analyst said all summer after that happened... Why that didn't happen? Mitchell. Wanna argue? Go check out how it was going when Rodney hood ran the show to begin that season.   He just managed 23.8 ppg in year 2 my guy. I have no idea why it doesn't sink in here how ridiculously impressive that is when the only players to best that in the league in their second year are 3 top 10 players (I forgot kat) and Vince Carter (who is still around lol)  So I mean, why is what I'm saying even controversial?  And because you've already gone there with the inefficiency, he managed what he just managed inefficiently because he had no spacing. If they start bogie at 3 and Royce at the 4, every single starter ( except gobert) and Ingles off the bench was 39% or better shooting spot up 3s this last season. That's just fucking ridiculous. And I'm pretty sure that's the kind of stuff ppl just aren't aware of and therefore don't understand what I'm saying.   I mean, there's no way in hell you think he is gonna be LESS efficient. Maybe you think he ends up being less ball dominant and his ppg falls, but if that's the case (and I don't personally think it will be) it only furthers my argument about how undervalued the roster as a whole is."
"Russell Westbrook game winner against warriors before durant left. It was like a spinning fade-away 3 in the corner, the whole sequence was crazy (note: I don’t think this was the most difficult of all time but it deserves some love)"
I chose to in this conversation because it has been a decided consensus since he was drafted that he was compared to him? Lol. You're under a rock or a troll.   And you know why. Because it totally disproves your attitude that he hasn't accomplished anything.  He's literally the only player in NBA history to lead his team in scoring as a rookie to a playoff series win. And on top of that he knocked out Paul George and Russell Westbrook. Two verified stars.
"Dame and D wade are who Donovan is most often compared to. I didn't decide that lol.   Also he played through an injury until the all Star break that he sustained vs the rockets, as well as the jazz having the hardest SoS in the league pre all star break. Both of those things were talked about all season lol.   And you seem to have a short term memory my guy. He dropped 40 on the thunder and knocked PG and MVP Russell Westbrook out of the playoffs. As a rookie. While being the teams ONLY shot creator. So..."
"“Russell Westbrook, what do you think?” Lmfao Payton Manning with a classic  red zone TD!"
Russell Westbrook has the speed without the touch
*Russell Westbrook has entered the chat*
"I don't disagree with anything you just said. All of that is possible if you don't view Mitchell as an inherent star level talent. Which you don't.    I'm not sure why, considering they were projected as a lottery team after losing Hayward, and Mitchell is the only reason they weren't (go check the beginning of Mitchell's rookie season when Rodney hood ran the show if you wanna argue with me on that) and then he topped that by beating the league MVP in Russell Westbrook as the teams ONLY shot creator and leading scorer in The playoffs. Even dropped 40 in the playoffs as a rookie as, again, the ONLY shot creator the jazz had.   But yeah, not a star. Nope. Definitely not a person likely to get massively (instead of just somewhat) better with lots of offensive help"
"You have an extremely short term memory. Utah was supposed to be a lottery team after losing Hayward. That's what every single analyst said all summer after that happened... Why that didn't happen? Mitchell.   They didn't have any pressure other than to go out and put up stats dude. They had absolutely no expectations of leading teams to victory in playoffs (they didn't even have the opportunity at the time). Whereas Mitchell successfully beat MVP Russell Westbrook in a 7 game series as the number 1 scoring player for his team. Literally the entire offense ran through him. As a rookie. Vs the mvp. And they won. So, again, short term memory.   When they were 22 they both had more years of experience in the league, and you know that. That's why you separated it out. They didn't come in and lead a team to a playoff victory in year 1.   He just managed 23.8 ppg in year 2 my guy. I have no idea why it doesn't sink in here how ridiculously impressive that is when the only players to best that in the league in their second year are 3 top 10 players (I forgot kat) and Vince Carter (who is still around lol)  So I mean, why is what I'm saying even controversial?  And yes, he managed what he just managed inefficiently because he had no spacing. If they start bogie at 3 and Royce at the 4, every single starter ( except gobert) and Ingles off the bench was 39% or better shooting spot up 3s this last season. That's just fucking ridiculous.

Maybe you think he ends up being less ball dominant and his ppg falls, but if that's the case (and I don't personally think it will be) it only furthers my argument about how undervalued the roster as a whole is.   I'm not worried about Kawhi on the Lakers because they're gonna roll with an 8 man playoff rotation including 4 vet mins lol... I'm personally more scared of kawhi on Toronto again or kawhi on the clippers"
"In my opinion, I would have the following ahead of him, in no particular order (12):  Curry Harden (he's used as a PG and is as much of a PG as Russell) Lillard CP3 Kyrie Westbrook Lowry Kemba Conley Simmons Fox Jrue   Players who are a close call but could arguably be considered better (13-16): Trae Wall (depending on health) LeVert Dragic"
"KD complained about the inaccessibility of Russell Westbrook as well, him being a married man."
"&gt;I'm not talking about Westbrook rebounds where Adams does all the boxing out while Russell crashes the lane. I'm talking about going in there as a PG and wrestling with centers for position and grabbing the ball almost right off the rim.  Well yeah, he's 6'10"". Comparing him to true PGs when it comes to crashing with bigs should always go in his favor."

"Because secretly Kendrick Perkins never had a decent season outside of Boston, and Russell Westbrook is and always has been a net negative."
"Offensively, yeah.   Simmons can guard all five positions. There's very few guys who can do that in the NBA. There's probably less than 30 people in the history of the league who can/could do that.   He's an excellent passer obviously, but his rebounding is incredible. I'm not talking about Westbrook rebounds where Adams does all the boxing out while Russell crashes the lane. I'm talking about going in there as a PG and wrestling with centers for position and grabbing the ball almost right off the rim.   Simmons does everything so well *besides shooting.* It's certainly important, and I'm not denying that it would open up our offense a bit if he learned to shoot, but even as he is right now, he's clearly worth the max, especially when you consider that he's already this good and hasn't even turned 23 yet."
He’s like the kid in school who says words don’t hurt him....   but then goes home to his mom and cries himself to sleep while his dad is embarrassed of him for being a little b*tch.  Russell Westbrook is his dad.
"Still remember that dunk, was completely insane. What's even more insane though is how the effin' eff did OKC not win a championship with the squad they had on the floor at the time:  * Kevin Durant * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * Serge Ibaka * Kendrick Perkins  That squad in 2017-2019 is a superteam defined, truly tragic they were never able to reach their final form."
"4% in True Shooting is indeed important. 4% is the difference between Klay Thompson and Russell Westbrook.  Personally, I'm not arguing that Siakam is *way* better than Simmons. However, I think Siakam's game is probably more valuable to a championship-level team. He can space the floor more effectively than Ben and is a better defender imo. Simmons's game is too 1-dimensional and is easily schemed against. Hence why Simmons averaged only 12 ppg in the ECF while Siakam averaged 19 ppg, and the Sixers ended up having to basically hide Simmons in the dunker's spot on offense.  And of course when you consider the fact that Simmons costs a ridiculous $34 mil/yr now, yeah I'd much rather have Siakam."
They trading Russell for Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook for Andrew Wiggins who says no
Russell Westbrook
russell westbrook tore his meniscus which is pretty crazy to me how much he still shows off his athleticism
KD averaged over 30 ppg when Russell Westbrook was injured
He would be like Russell Westbrook with a jumper and better BBIQ
"That and the homer takes, lord the homer takes. Would you like to hear about how De’Aaron Fox is going to be basically Russell Westbrook with higher IQ and a better jumper? Perhaps how you wouldn’t trade Bagley for Giannis straight up because he’s younger and you have more years of team control? You can find that type of shit in any team sub."
"I'd take any duo that has Russell Westbrook in it,cause Russell Westbrook is a beast,and he's the king of triple-double,and everybody knows,the more rebounds you stack,the better player you are,so KD is a bum because he doesn't get as many rebounds and assists and also he left OKC and Westbrook wold never cause he's loyal and he won MVP,he just really unlucky in the playoffs and blah,blah,blah...  &amp;#x200B;  Get them cookie crums off your bellies,the worst version of KD and Kyrie is still better than Brick City."
"Bulls get: Russell Westbrook  Thunder get: Otto Porter, Wendell Carter, Kris Dunn, 2020 first-round pick, 2022 Top-5 protected  lmao"
Surely there has to be another pick or two in there. It’s Russell Westbrook.
"You got me on that one, but what’s your team? Let’s say it’s the Toronto Raptors; the champions of the 19-20 season. If Kyle Lowry isn’t available and you have the chance to pick up Russell Westbrook or CP3 who are you choosing?   Defensively: Russell Offensively: He can’t shoot (toss up) but Russell   76ers: Can’t have Ben Simmons but you can have Russell or CP3, who you choosing? Also one of the reasons the 76ers lost was because of the softness of play by Ben in some cases.  You’re picking the superstar with heart that will play hard, or CP3?"
So Russell Westbrook is giving you 10 and 6 in the playoffs on a good system? HECK NO
"There's a ""Russell Westbrook on a farm"" joke in here somewhere but I'm too stupid to think of one"
"Blake Griffin, Andre Drummond, Drose, and Russell Westbrook would immediately become an amazing team in the east, no matter what anybodies opinions on him is.... Reggie to Westbrook would be a huge upgrade"
"Also, the Thunder also once had Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook all on the same team (with Ibaka!) and didn’t win a title.  You win some and lose some."
"Billy Donovan is a mediocre coach, but Presti is also consistently unable to put together a functional roster.  Russell Westbrook is shorter LeBron James with a higher motor. He's a drive-and-kick star. The Thunder could be great if they had *any fucking spacing* but Presti goes for ""long and athletic"" over ""has skills, especially shooting"".  Westbrook gets a lot of stick for his tendency to chuck bad shots but he's never got anyone open to pass to because they have *no spacing*."
Damn I’m actually really liking the prospect of Russell Westbrook at the Pistons ngl
OKC trades Russell Westbrook to OKC
Russell &amp; Westbrook
ever hear when coaches say some players are uncoachable? meet russell westbrook.   his passion and aggressiveness take over and it becomes all about him. that’s why he takes those dumbass shots. no one can question him cuz he just gives so much effort!
Russell Westbrook contract is fine. 3 first round exits in a row is actually good
"Bro, we are in the east &amp; it’s Russell fucking Westbrook. He just averaged a triple double for 3 straight seasons!?!?   We just one of the best two way players in the game,  if we can pair him with someone as dynamic &amp; tough as WB &amp; they Gel why the hell would you not want that..."
&gt;I didn't mention Russell as he will likely get traded since the warriors don't need him  Disagree. Russell Westbrook would fit in well.
"I don't get why this is such a problem. If money doesn't solve it, your solution is to just outright use force? I mean come on.   If someone doesn't want to take tens of millions of dollars to play for you, they just don't want to play for you. How is trying to force them to play there a solution? Most players would just sandbag and just play to protect themselves/get stats. If you believe in team chemistry and morale and effort, you should absolutely want players to be happy.   But realistically, fans don't even respect players that want to be there. So many fans shit on their home superstar and want to just get rid of him. Like Russell Westbrook gets crapped on so much, and even LeBron in his first run on Cleveland was getting belittled. People act like these fanbases are victims, but most of the time they shit all over players and really don't deserve that unilateral loyalty."
Aren’t you the guy who claimed Russell Westbrook was barely a starting caliber player?

Bruce Brown is basically Russell Westbrook.
I would say no. We have no one close to as good as Russ on our roster at the moment but it feels premature. I don't want to jettison what young talent we do have just to be a lone-wolf-Russell-Westbrook team which I think isn't going far even in the weaker East. I think the right direction for the Bulls is to wait to see how our young players develop; trading for Russ would be trying to skip a step in our rebuild and likely will just get us stuck in mediocrity for the length of that gargantuan contract.
"&gt;Russell Westbrook and Steven Adams for Zach Lavine, Coby White, Wendell Carter and a 1st  Hard pass"
"nah, main problem is russell westbrook sucks, he can't really levitate other teammates"
"Are you suggesting Houston trade four unprotected firsts, two pick swaps, and Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook and Patrick Patterson?"
"&gt; acquire draft picks or free agents with our $90 million in cap space next summer?  Tell me the percentages ANY of those ""draft picks or free agents"" will ever be as good as fucking Russell Westbrook.   &gt; Why trade our future for a PG who’s never come close to winning a championship...?  Wow, with this logic, I should supermax Patrick McCaw and give Jeremy Lin a long term deal as well"
Because you'd have to give up value to get Russell Westbrook. You would also likely need to give up value to get rid of Wiggins.
"Hell yeah it is! I know most of y'all hate him, but he helped to secure our franchise. If we were to blow up when KD left, then we'd have started with a whole lot of nothing. But since Russ stayed and PG came, we got 7 picks and our Point Guard of the future, so hell yeah it's Russell Westbrook Day"
here’s a fact  russell westbrook sucks !   -- r/nba
"Wtf do you expect to do?   Pray to Drake that he can attract some free agents to Toronto? Gee I wonder how that just worked out when we literally bent over backwards for Kawhi.  If I have the chance to secure an elite PG like Russell Westbrook, you damn right I'm going to do it.   &gt; Westbrook isn’t a championship player. Not worth it, unless we’re getting multiple firsts.  oh ok, you are delusional"
It’s Russell Westbrook day too! .... cause everyday is russell westbrook day in Oklahoma
Lmao as one of Westbrooks biggest critics this slander has gone too far for my taste.   It's fucking Russell Westbrook. You guys are acting like he's Jeff Teague or some shit.
"Okay, so.  Russell Westbrook is at Paris Fashion Week...  ... wearing a t-shirt with a slogan printed on it and an off-white *floppy hat* with the *cord done up to his chin*.  While eating at the kind of restaurant/cafe where you are served a zillion tiny dishes on a *white linen tablecloth*.  I have *so many questions*."
"Wiggins , a first round pick unprotected and 2 2nd round picks for Russell Westbrook?"
"Why is everyone pretending that Westbrook isn’t a part of the Thunder team. PG didn’t leave because of the management or the owners, he left because he didn’t feel he could win, part of that reason is the roster, which Russell is a part of."
"The next question, if you will, couldn’t be any more painfully obvious now: How long will Russell Westbrook remain in Oklahoma City?  Now that the Thunder have chosen to part ways with Paul George, granting his wish by sending him to the Clippers in exchange for a massive haul and helping L.A. land Kawhi Leonard in the process, the uncertainty that surrounds their former MVP is as glaringly obvious as that water tower that breaks up the city’s skyline in Bricktown. Even before you start to dissect all the personal dynamics, or the history between Westbrook and the organization that has grown so much more complicated in recent years in the wake of Kevin Durant’s departure, there’s this harsh reality as it relates to this trade: the timelines between the two sides don’t match anymore.  When you land the sort of haul that Thunder general manager Sam Presti pulled in, you simply have to come to grips with the fact that the title-contending dream has been replaced by the recovery and rebuild. The Thunder received five first-round picks in all: one unprotected from Miami in 2021 and one protected from the Heat in 2023 (1 to 14); three unprotected from the Clippers in 2022, 2024, and 2026. What’s more, they received the right to swap picks (unprotected) in 2023 and 2025.  Last but certainly not least, it’s the arrival of second-year point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander that informs the widespread belief around the league that Westbrook’s days with the Thunder are numbered. The Clippers spent the entire season raving about the 20-year-old who was taken 11th overall out of Kentucky, envisioning a dream scenario where Kevin Durant and Leonard would come their way and Gilgeous-Alexander would eventually evolve into a worthy co-star alongside those greats.  This, it’s quite clear, isn’t the kind of player who would be excited about being a backup for the next four seasons in which Westbrook is owed a combined $171 million (including a player option in 2022-23 in which he’d be paid $47 million). And if you’re in Presti’s position, try chewing on these economics without spitting out your Thunder stick: Gilgeous-Alexander, by comparison, is owed $13.5 million combined during the next three seasons.  So, where does this all go?  Sources confirmed an ESPN report that Presti, Westbrook and his longtime agent, Thad Foucher, are expected to talk in the coming days about how to best handle this unexpected situation. None of them knew until just a few days ago that Leonard had put on his recruiting hat and convinced George to seek a trade, and now they’re left to figure out the best path forward for all involved. And while the mountains of money owed to Westbrook are known to have scared quite a few general managers away, sources say that Detroit and Miami are very real possibilities as potential landing spots for the 30-year-old, eight-time All-Star.  The Heat landed Jimmy Butler via a sign-and-trade with Philadelphia in free agency, and they could conceivably build a package around the likes of Goran Dragic (one year, $19.2 million remaining) and former Thunder guard Dion Waiters (two years, combined $24.7 million) to pair him with Westbrook. The Pistons’ scenario appears to be potentially trickier, with likely candidates to make the salaries match including big man Andre Drummond (two years, $55.8 million combined, including a player option in 2020-21), former Thunder guard Reggie Jackson (one year, $18 million) and Tony Snell (two years, $23.5 million combined, with a player option in 2020-21).  Rival executives have also pinpointed the Houston Rockets as a likely suitor, which would come as no surprise considering the way general manager Daryl Morey has prioritized the pursuit of stars during his entire career (not to mention the possible reunion between Westbrook and his old Thunder teammate James Harden). The notion of Westbrook sharing the floor with two other ball-dominant guards is unorthodox, to say the least, but Morey has long held the belief that landing as many elite players as possible is the path to championship glory.  Though the Thunder discussed George trades with both the Clippers and Raptors this week, multiple sources said Westbrook was not made available in those talks. With George gone, though, discussions are likely to open up.  The Thunder like to move patiently, and in silence. They managed only half of that in trading George, with negotiations that stayed under wraps but were rushed, as necessitated by his sudden trade request and a limited window in which to work.  There’s no looming deadline with Westbrook, and OKC is unlikely to enter lightly into trading him. He has played his entire 11-year career with the Thunder. Parting would be painful, even if both parties agree it’s for the best.  Despite Westbrook’s steely exterior, he may be more connected to a single fan base — and more embraced by it — than any superstar in the league. Kevin Durant moved on; George came and went. But Westbrook’s commitment to the Thunder has never publicly wavered.  Still, his legacy is complicated.  The Thunder haven’t won a playoff series since Durant left for Golden State in free agency. Oklahoma City tried pairing Westbrook with Victor Oladipo and then with George without postseason success to show for it.  Those playoff struggles might ease the burden of losing Westbrook for a franchise that grew accustomed to success for most of its first decade. If the Thunder under Westbrook have grown stale, is it time to start fresh?  That’s the next question facing the Thunder, and it may prove challenging to answer. Westbrook is rooted in Oklahoma City’s past, but their future together rarely has seemed so uncertain."
"KD, Curry, Lebron, Kawhi Leonard, PG, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Giannis, Damien Lillard. So 11 I guess.   Then I’d put Draykond Green, Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook in a second tier."

"two way player who can shoot, nick nurse ran the same plays he ran for kawhi for siakam, siakam's iso-game is improving, it's the one area of his game that' expanded and he's improved his mid-range and free throws to the point where he's already ALL nba level, and has superstar potential to reach. He knows his blueprint, ask rico hines, maybe if you scout your players you'll understand what im talking about. Rico hines trains the same guys like paul george and russell westbrook, even PG respects pascal's game. RIco said pascal is coming for MVP next, right after he won MIP. Wanna come back to this post in a year mr aggresssive?"
"Why is no one talking about how Toronto forced DeMar DeRozan out of the city in the third year of a 5-year Max contract?    Oh yeah, because they won the championship.     NBA legacies are defined by results. It's a result oriented league, and no team or player is loyal to their player/team if it means it will impede their chances of competing for a championship.    After two pathetic playoff outings in consecutive years... you ask yourself if you would rather play next to Russell Westbrook or Kawhi Leonard."
Detroit Piston Russell Westbrook
Bonafide contenders don't want Russell Westbrook.
Klay will miss the majority of the season and their roster is thin. Plus no one outside of Russell and Curry can shoot. Green is no longer an all star and his shooting has regressed big time.   The Clips traded SGA and Gallo. 2 players.   I don’t think it is a stretch to say that Kawhi now is better than what Westbrook ever was/is.
"Here is what the article about the trade says, and why I think ultimately Kawhi wanted to go home. Trust, If there was a legit way to get with giving up the entire team Masai would.   According to Woj:  ""Had Presti been able to strike a deal for George with the Raptors -- and Leonard was willing to stay -- George was believed to be willing to join the Raptors too, sources said. Presti had been willing to pursue a package of [Russell Westbrook](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook)and George to the Raptors, but no talks ever gained traction, sources said. Ujiri and Raptors GM Bobby Webster had no ability, nor inclination, to counter the Clippers' offer with a multitude of first-round picks into the middle of next decade, league sources said.  The Raptors could have been looking at adding Westbrook, with four years and $171 million left on his deal, and George to a team that Leonard still might have parted ways with. Toronto extended itself as far as it could for Leonard, but Ujiri could never be sure that the Thunder even wanted to do a deal with them -- and perhaps were just using the Raptors to squeeze more out of the Clippers."
"During the rockets series we were like +5 with him on the floor and -40 with him off. The Portland series pg was dealing with injury. In 2016 with Russell Westbrook as our point guard, we were up 3-1 on the greatest regular season team of all time. Westbrook is just fine in the playoffs. Our TEAM as a whole tho is not. Including front office and coaching. Three first round exits because of our team, not because of Westbrook."
I'd be excited to see Blake Griffin and Russell westbrook on this team. As long as we keep sekou
Who could Russell Westbrook join? Where does he actually fit and make the team better?
"As I said in my first comment, I think the Knicks are the type of team that would trade for Russell Westbrook without concern for how it affects their result on the court. That's all I came to this thread to say."
"To put things into perspective:  I support a Rugby League team called the NZ Warriors (lol) and for the past few years they had a star player named Shaun Johnson that started his career in the team.  Made the grand final (but didn't win) in his rookie year.  But since then we missed the playoffs year after year until 7 years later we finally made the playoffs again.  Then he was offloaded from the team at the off-season.  He has incredible talent like Russ but he was also too much of a show pony and that was also his weakness.  When we had him in our team the majority of our offense was based around him so if he didn't play a good game we were screwed, just like Russ with the Thunder.   I think the Thunder needs a more balanced team going into the future and build around foundation players like Steven Adams where they do the little things right and not having players like Westbrook overplaying his hand and losing games in critical moments due to brain explosions.  People from Thunder sub would downvote this post into oblivion but IDGAF, are they in love with Russell Westbrook or the team? If they are just Westbrook supporters then they should go find another team to support.    Personally I am not a fan of Westbrook and the only reasons why I started supporting the team was because of Adams and KD.  I think Adams will remain a Thunder until he retires in 10 years time.  I also think Adams along with the Thunder will win at least 2 rings during this 10 year run.  I just don't think the Thunder will be able to recruit another 'generation' player during this run until they draft the next All Star.  When the Thunder is ready to push for another legitimate title contention run, I'm sure all the cards will fall in place for another star recruitment but I think it will be the next generation of stars which rules out all current All-Stars."
"Im with lowe in thinking Russell Westbrook has negative trade value on this contract.  No way in he'll youd need to flip that much to get him, and if I'm the piston I can prolly swing this without the adams/drummond part of it."
"You would be trading those for Paul George, Russell Westbrook, and Kawhi Leonard, not just PG."
Russell Westbrook is hands down the most entertaining NBA player for the last decade.
"Russell Westbrook to the raptors for Fred VanVleet fleet is the best move for Toronto, We need anything now that Kahwi is gone"
Can I introduce you to Russell Westbrook
The curse is a guy named Russell Westbrook
It’ll be like Dangelo Russell or Westbrook type efficiency but I bet his 3 point % will still be solid
"Jesus christ. I cant believe ""Where is Kawhi going"" has turned into ""PG traded out of OKC and Russell Westbrook may be gone too""  This is fucking nuts"
Who tf is pining for Russell Westbrook is my question.
C'mon it's Russell fucking Westbrook.
maybe the lesson that Lakers ownership gets out of this is that they should not wait around for a free-agent unless they say specifically they want to play for LA. But then again all George said that and then he's on the other la team. Tough situation but I think from OKC made a good decision. a toxic locker room with Paul George and Russell Westbrook has the recipe for nuclear explosion

Breaking: Russell Westbrook has hired Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group as his new agent
I dont think a human can be in a better shape than russell westbrook  His whole frame and body is goals
"We don’t need Adams though, right now Westbrook’s contract is not a good thing for the Thunder. Take advantage of that and bring his ass down to Miami where our culture can potentially mold him to bring the best out of him. It’s Russell fucking Westbrook, you don’t pass up on that, no way."
Russell Westbrook in 5 years is better than John throughout his contract
"Presti has been making water out of wine for a few seasons and now that he has some freedom to maneuver, we’ll see what he can do.  The OKC’s number 1 problem is Russell Westbrook - other stars do not want to play with him leading the way, and Russell will not take a back seat. It’s happened twice now, and it’s time the team moved on from the Westbrook era. Presti has recognized this and I expect he will execute another good trade here, get some cap relief and some more assets to build with.  All told he’s done a fine job. Players matter."
But you get Russell Westbrook and Paul George with Nick Nurse and the Eastern Conference
"[why not this one?](https://i.imgur.com/AEnBwtg.jpg)  Miami gets: Russell Westbrook Dallas gets: Goran Dragic, 2026 1st round pick Oklahoma gets: James Johnson, 2023 1st round pick"

Again, I'm not the one shouting team success at you. you're saying he cant get it done...its a team game. no one can get it done alone. Lebron ""couldnt get it done"" in 2018, that doesnt mean he wasnt the best player on the floor in those playoffs right?"
"Russell Westbrook is def not what Pop needs to compete, lol"
That's fine with me. Russell Westbrook will never win a Championship.
"Any number of picks could be added to satisfy this, and it would have to be delayed for 30 days if Herro is included, but this trade works with the cap   **OKC Gets**:  Goran Dragic @ 19.2m  Justise Winslow @ 13m  Tyler Herro @ 3.6m  *TOTAL* 35.8m    **Miami Gets**:  Russell Westbrook @ 38.5 mil"
Legit question to fans of teams that aren't the Thunder: Would you want Russell Westbrook and his max contract on your team and who is your team?
I agree.   This move arguably makes the Clippers a favorite (if not THE favorite) to win championships for the next several years. They essentially gave up 5 1st round picks and a couple average players for 2 top-10 players for the next 3-4 years. Its a no brainer.   For the Thunder they clearly aren't gonna be contending for championships. PG wanted out. They need to move on from Russell Westbrook. They looked at the Anthony Davis situation and struck while the iron was hot and got a good haul to kick off the rebuild.   Its a good trade.
"KD, Victor Oladipo, Serge Ibaka and Steven Adams all disagree with you. However, that’s a different convo entirely.   Heat fans can feel that way, but beggars can’t be choosers. Heat have a way to get Russell freaking Westbrook, an All-Star caliber player, even with his butcheek shooting, and they can do it without hurting their roster or future too badly… can’t see why Heat fans wouldn’t want that."
Next week  [Shams Charania] Russell Westbrook has requested a trade from OKC
"&gt; Both Brooks and Donovan are consensus seen as Bottom 5 to Bottom 10 at best coaches in the NBA.  This is what fans think, and despite how cool and smart this sub is, a lot of people couldn't tell you what makes a good or bad head coach aside from, ""He takes TOs well."" What coach is really telling MVP Russell Westbrook to run a set play every time he goes down the court. The thing about superstar PGs is most of the coaches let them run the show. What happens on the floor is not always the coach, but the guard."
"It’s fucking russell westbrook. Of course teams will be interested.   You want people in the seats, having westbrook fills those seats"
For Russell Westbrook lmao. Easiest way for Minn to get a star is to trade for one
Imagine your best players before Jimmy were *squints*… Justise Winslow and Goran Dragic and not wanting Russell fucking Westbrook lmao
It’s not about getting picks for Russell Westbrook I think it’s more about getting your own pick as high in the lottery as you can before the pick swaps with the Clippers convey.
It would result in a vicious endless loop of Russell Westbrook dunking on Russell Westbrook in practice.
No chance Russell Westbrook would get along with Russell Westbrook
Have you seen how much Russell Westbrook makes
"Y'all really need to read the article:  ""Presti had been willing to pursue a package of Russell Westbrook and George to the Raptors, but no talks ever gained traction, sources said."""
Russell Westbrook on the New York Knicks any day baby come to MSG will love you
I have one Russell Westbrook for you.
**nobody in the league is paying 33 year old russell westbrook 47 million.**
"Sorry, but I prefer a healthy Russell Westbrook over a cripple."
"**nobody in the league is paying 33 year old russell westbrook 47 million dollars**  you hate to see it, but this is what the loyalty gets you.   he’s on the thunder til he hangs em up"
Russell Westbrook and Damian Lillard
last year CP3 was still better than westbrook in the playoffs. He still had the better TS% and WS/48 than westbrook. There are no words to describe how next level awful westbrook was in the playoffs. You'd have to give *me* assets to take on russell westbrook
Calm down man you act like you guys just lost Paul George who you recently signed to a huge contract and are about to lose Russell Westbrook for probably some draft picks and a couple guys that might be good”
"I am flabbergasted that a Blazer fan who watched the playoffs would look at Russell Westbrook and think, ""Yeah, that's the missing piece we need right there""."
This is one of the articles that got me interested in basketball in the first place (the other one being [this other Westbrook article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/magazine/the-misunderstood-genius-of-russell-westbrook.html) and the reason I started watching and became a fan of the NBA. Thought it was appropriate to post in retrospect during all this new uncertainly and clamor surrounding him after PG's departure.  Lots of people have Westbrook counted out completely now and it'll be interesting to see how he handles his path and rises to the challenge in the next few years.
No it’s Russell Westbrook day! (Inb4 Russ gets traded tomorrow)
Russell Westbrook wont return assets
"Russell Westbrook will demonstrate he was the epitome of ""good numbers on a bad team""."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo - Eurostep  James Harden - Flop/Travel  Draymond Green - *Angry Donkey Noises*  Stephen Curry - Stepback Three  Dirk Nowitski - Fadeaway  Kevin Durant - Pull-Up Transition Three  Russell Westbrook - Cockback Slam Dunk  Ben Simmons - 0/17 3PT  Joel Embiid - Flex, Crowd Pump, &amp; Flop  Kyrie Irving - *Kowalksi Analysis*"

"People get traded with one year on their deal all the time--including Harris, Butler, and others at the deadline last year. Conversely, you could easily argue that Conley has a much WORSE contract than Kemba because he's gonna make $34 million when he's 32 and he has a significant injury history.   Once it became clear (well before the deadline) that the AD trade wasn't happening, the Lakers would've had to consider flipping some of those assets for Kemba instead of waiting for the godfather offer over the summer (especially given rumors that AD was coming in 2020 no matter what). I'm not saying that they WOULD have, just that they would have to consider.  You didn't even address most of the other teams, but all it takes is one or two teams willing to start talks for a market to heat up. Russell Westbrook was called one of the worst contracts in the league literal hours before he netted the Thunder a butt-ton of 1st round picks. A competent GM definitely could've moved Kemba for some decent assets last trade deadline."
"Anthony Bennett had the worst lowlight real on DX of any prospect ever, dude was so lazy.  Of course, Enes Kanter and Clint Capela had similar issues with being lazy as fuck before they were drafted and they still were successful.  Hasheem Thabeet was widely thought of as not being worth his selection beforehand.  Russell Westbrook as well.  Dion Waiters and Tristan Thompson selections were both ridiculed as well.  Jaylen Brown had some people thinking he went too high."
Not a chance. KD took that team to 7 games with Russell Westbrook and Enes Kanter.
"""Why not?"" - Russell Westbrook"
"LeBron James, Steve curry, James Harden, kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie, Durant, Vince carter, Michael Beasley"
"Huh, seemed like he had the ball in his hands much more in LA than he did in Houston. Granted this is just from the eye test though.   So we're going from a 22.0 USG% last year (CP3) to 30.1 USG% Russell Westbrook. We need Harden's usage rate to go down anyways so he can be fresher for the playoffs so as long as they can learn to co-exist on the court (which I belive they will - they've been friends since middle school) then we should be good."
I one day hope to be as satisfied as Russell Westbrook was that day
"DWS is a horrible stat, Andre Drummond lead the league this year and luminaries such as Russell Westbrook and Nikola Vucevic were top 10. There’s also a reason we had four guys in the top 20 last year, and it’s not because we have four of the top 20 defenders in the league. It’s absolutely worthless. DBPM is better but it’s still not great, just like any other defensive advanced stat. Bledsoe is very obviously a miles better defender.  Bledsoe played with three other ball handlers in the starting lineup, ironically right next to a scoring first 3/4 as the best player on the team. He’s a point guard but he spent a hell of a lot less time on-ball than your average PG, it’s not like his assists were inflated. He’s not a fantastic passer for his position or anything but neither is Harris, and your average passing PG is a whole lot better than your average passing forward."
He would be Russell Westbrook
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony"

"The Memphis series has jack shit to do with this, u said KD hasn't won a series without Russ when he finished off the damn series after Russ went down  Meanwhile Russell Statbrook can't even get out the first round even with a whole other all star and Too 3 MVP candidate on his team. At least when KD lost to Memphis all he had was Ibaka, lmao  Statbrook has lost 3 straight fucking years in the 1st round, even getting sauced by a Spanish matador in the process. So yes, he hasn't done ""blah blah"" without KD. Seriously what the fuck was the point of u posting ur original comment? What are u trying to mock? Westbrook really HASN'T done shit without KD..so what point are u trying to make? Other than just looking like a typical dumb Statbrook stan?"
“Russell Westbrook requests trade after PG trade”
I think prime Russell Westbrook and Derrick Rose would like a word
"I watched Paul when he was on the Hornets lol. Just because you're old doesn't automatically make your opinions superior or more validated than others. You're really having an ""old man yells at cloud"" moment here. You're not special for having been born earlier than someone else. Not to mention you're completely assuming everyone's age here.  &gt;Prime CP3 was better than Westbrook at every single aspect of the game dude....  &gt;every single aspect of the game dude....  &gt;every single aspect  If you didn't believe he was more athletic than Russell you wouldn't have explicitly said ""every single aspect"" lol.  And no, their athletic primes are still not close. Paul was much more skilled, but he never had the raw athleticism and durability that Russ does."
"Lmao their athleticism isn't even close dude. Just because Paul once dunked on someone doesn't mean he objectively had the same explosiveness. Westbrook is genuinely one of the most tenacious dunking PGs to ever play the game. There's a reason why there's probably like 2 videos of Chris Paul dunking on Youtube while you can find entire compilations of ridiculous Russell dunks. Not to mention Westbrook is a fucking ironman compared to Paul, rarely ever misses games due to injury and has played through injury to boot. He's also faster and quicker than Paul ever was.  If you wanna claim that he was a better passer, shooter, ballhandler, defender, sure. But I have absolutely no idea why you're so anti-Russ that you can't even admit that he's clearly more athletic than Chris ever was."
Westbrook Russell
Dude when did I actually imply that tho 😂 my entire argument has been that you’re point is wrong. You said prime cp3 is better than Russell Westbrook and I quote “IN EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THE GAME”. You’re arguing like we’ve been debating who the better player is in their prime or something? Changing the subject to try to be right just like a child lmao. Oh yeah bro another aspect that Westbrook’s better in is durability. Hit me up again when cp3 plays another full post season 😂 how you gonna sit here and reply to me saying I’m done replying and still act like I’m the aggressor just cause I use scary cuss words hahaha you fucking baby maybe you should’ve just let it be the first couple times I said I didn’t wanna reply to you 😂
I'm confused.  Russell Westbrook participated in playoff games before Durant left?  *Weird...*
"With Russell Westbrook chucking 30+ times shooting 29% from deep like he has each of the last two seasons.   Listen. This is a specific thread, and I obviously expect you to make the playoffs and even finally get to the second round (an achievement for Russ without Durant).  But this sub has gone nuts analyzing Russ lately. Dude is coming off a really, really bad basketball season."
Rockets because I'm not going to ignore the last two seasons of Russell Westbrook like the rest of the r/NBA.
"Russell Westbrook is going to set screens for Harden?   But...but you would just switch that. They're likely going to be guarded by smaller, perimeter defenders so screens between the two are useless.  Off ball screens and cutting are where Russ needs to improve. This is what Roberson does to make himself an offensive threat when not being guarded (assuming Russ' man is giving him the three). This is provided the Rockets want to add more movement into their offense.  Harden, meanwhile, can proceed to just stand there and floor space off the ball because of his shooting. They can play their spread ISO style when Russ has the ball."

Jimmy Butler and Russell Westbrook gotta be in that list. I wanted to see them punch their way thru the east so bad.
James Harden if Russell Westbrook is out with an injury.
Are you sure about that? Russell Westbrook is suddenly going to flip the switch to be Robin to Harden’s Batman? The guy who is so ball-dominant that people think he’s selfish?  I don’t see it. And it rings hollow to hear a bunch of Rockets fans suddenly put Westbrook on a pedestal when y’all spent the past forever dragging his name through the mud.

"Lol you're point is not even slightly made dude. It's hilarious that you actually can't comprehend basic facts. I don't know how many more ways to try to simplify math for you. The odds of Giannis having a back-to-back MVP season this year are exactly precisely 4/25. Not extremely common. Now can he be a Lebron or an MJ and beat the odds? Sure. Is it extremely common to do so? No.   Let me break this down for you with the actual list from your timeframe since you can't seem to comprehend basic math or facts.   2018-19     Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (Voting) 2017-18     James Harden, Houston Rockets (Voting) 2016-17     Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder (Voting) 2015-16     Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors (Voting) 2014-15     Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 2013-14     Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder 2012-13     LeBron James, Miami Heat 2011-12     LeBron James, Miami Heat 2010-11     Derrick Rose, Chicago Bulls 2009-10     LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2008-09     LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2007-08     Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers 2006-07     Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks 2005-06     Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2004-05     Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2003-04     Kevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves 2002-03     Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2001-02     Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2000-01     Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers 1999-00     Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers 1998-99     Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1997-98     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1996-97     Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1995-96     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1994-95     David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs 1993-94     Hakeem Olajuwon, Houston Rockets 1992-93     Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns 1991-92     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1990-91     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls   As you can see, outside of MJ and Lebron James the only players to experience b2bs are: Tim Duncan, Steph Curry, and Steve Nash.  The top 2 players of all time won 8/30 of the last 30 MVP seasons. Even including them, one unique person per decade gets to experience this feat. The 2010s already had theirs in Steph Curry, it'd be a statistical outlier for it to happen again this year. It's an extremely uncommon feat.   Nothing about what you are saying jives with the actual data which shows a host of MVP seasons dominated by MJ and Lebron with one other person per decade pulling in a b2b which already happened."
Russell Westbrook is not a good isolation player. Need way fewer Westbrook iso possessions
I figure he'll definitely get in behind Harden Dame Westbrook. He's winning more and scoring better than Mitchell and Russell and CJ
"Before anything else, I just want to say that this is great work! Super interesting to look at the rankings, and amazing graphics / presentation/ open-source code.  When I was looking at the unicorns list, however, it struck me that the unicorns (outside of Svi) were mostly just a list of the best players in the NBA. You point this out a lot in your post, and your top PCA factor loadings reflect this by prioritizing usage states and counting stats. This makes sense, seeing as part of the reason we call people unicorns is that they're really good, in addition to being really weird.  But still, I wanted to see what the process would look like if it de-prioritized usage and effectiveness. To do this, I re-ran your code subtracting all counting stats (e.g. PPG) and advanced effectiveness stats (e.g. VORP, BPM). The subtraction of those stats were a little arbitrary, but had some interesting results.  |Guard Components    | Factor 1                   | Factor 2                  | Factor 3                  | Factor 4                   | Factor 5                   | |----|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0  | TOV%                | TIME_OF_POSS       | AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH | AST%                | AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH   | | 1  | 2P%                 | eFG%               | DRIVE_FG%          | FG%                 | TS%                 | | 2  | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | DRB%               | BLK%               | ORB%                | TRB%                | | 3  | TRB%                | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%    | POST_TOUCH_FG%     | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH  | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | | 4  | 3P%                 | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH | POST_TOUCH_FG%     | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%     | 3PAr                |  | Wings Components | Factor 1            | Factor 2        | Factor 3           | Factor 4            | Factor 5            | |---------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0             | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | TIME_OF_POSS    | eFG%               | TS%                 | FG%                 | | 1             | 3PAr                | 3P%             | eFG%               | AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH  | AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH   | | 2             | C&amp;S_FG%             | 2P%             | FT%                | BLK%                | ORB%                | | 3             | DFG%                | 3PAr            | TOV%               | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH  | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | | 4             | FTr                 | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG% | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | STL%                |  | Bigs Components | Factor 1        | Factor 2            | Factor 3            | Factor 4            | Factor 5            | |-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0               | 2P%             | TRB%                | 3PAr                | ORB%                | FG%                 | | 1               | DRIVE_FG%       | AST%                | AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH  | TIME_OF_POSS        | AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH   | | 2               | PAINT_TOUCH_FG% | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%     | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | TOV%                | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | | 3               | eFG%            | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | 2P%                 | PAINT_TOUCH_FG%     | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH  | | 4               | BLK%            | PULL_UP_FG%         | C&amp;S_FG%             | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | DRIVE_FG%           |  For guards, it seems like the first component reflects people who hold the ball a lot, the second component those who are good scorers, and the 3/4/5 reflect more play in the paint.  For wings, 1 is overall effectiveness, 2 might be propensity for threes vs driving, 3 I have no idea, and 4 for post play.  For bigs, 1 is hard to say, but 2 seems to reflect ball handling, and the rest I don't really know.  So how does this shake out with unicorns then? We get some weirder ones, with fewer past/future MVPs.

Honestly, I can't tell because I'm not as familiar with the play styles of players like, uh, Gary Clark/Hamidou Diallo/Svi. Maybe others can chime in on that. It does preserve some players that we know are weird even we subtracted their effectiveness, like the Greek Freak (dribbling death-center), Ben Simmons + Russel Westbrook (rebounding triple-double machines), Joe Ingles (super-shooting big), and Lebron (Lebron). The least unique guard is Bogdan Bogdanovich, wing is Jayson Tatum, and big is Zach Collins, which all feel kind of right to me.  Food for thought, anyway! Again, great post, thanks for putting in all this work."
Russell Westbrook has accomplished this 3 times.      Westbrook &gt; Lebron

"Players should not be discredited for what they're doing in the modern era. However, I do strongly agree that we must consider the context when drawing conclusions on players and their legacies by just looking at their box scores.   Personally, I've struggled to figure out the conversion rate of box score performances in the modern game versus what they would have looked like in virtually any other era of my life.   Like, you guys can go ahead and argue about James Harden and Russell Westbrook or whatever. But I'm over here trying to figure out how Luke Kennard is averaging 18 points per game. Dude would be leading the 2004 Pistons in scoring right now.   Meanwhile, next to Dennis Rodman, Ben Wallace is probably the most skilled rebounder I've ever seen in my life. Dude seemed like a basketball magnet, ripping boards down in traffic with nary a consideration for others. Yet here I am watching Andre Drummond just casually walk himself into four to five more defensive rebounds than Wallace generally ever averaged himself.   This doesn't mean Luke Kennard can't score and Andre Drummond can't rebound. And 2004 was just about the polar opposite of 2020, but I do think it helps illustrate that things are just different now. For instance, it's only my personal opinion, but I don't think 2004 Chauncey Billups is getting outscored by 2020 Luke Kennard if he played for the 2020 Pistons.   **TL;DR** Numbers abound nowadays, so comparing them to other eras isn't going to tell us the whole story. In some cases, it's the modern equivalent of us formerly trying to compare the best rebounders of the 2000's to Wilt's 50-rebound, plus-paced era."
Well considering Russell Westbrook is the 3rd best PG at best I'd say probably dame
Wow he put up better counting stats on a team that went 8 games below .500. I can’t wait to see what you think of Russell Westbrook. There’s a reason the pelicans didn’t want anything to do with your young core.
Dude you have to remember that there's some of us out there who hate on Russell Westbrook without needing to point out any of his flaws as a basketball player.
Ya but when Russell Westbrook loses it's kind of awesome...
"Russell Westbrook is literally Mr First Round, how do they think they can talk shit lol"
"A team coached by Popovich, Kerr, maybe Spoelstra.  He needs a coach who's good at man management. (And, you know, actual coaching, so... not Donovan, anyway, but still.) One he respects and who can and will pull him in when he gets tunnel vision.  The best thing about Russell Westbrook is that he's super-emotional and plays with absolute passion.  The worst thing about Russell Westbrook is that he's super-emotional and plays with absolute passion.  Given a coach who can consistently channel that to best effect, he'd be unstoppable."
Russell Westbrook really is the Jeckyl/Hyde of the NBA.
Well seems like the Russell Westbrook dickriders from 2 days ago really have quieted down 🤫🤔
"Russell ""1stvround"" Westbrook"
Only in the demented mind of a Spurs fan is Patty Mills a better player than Russell Westbrook LOL
"You should be trading Russell Westbrook. That dude's never going to win a championship until he learns how to not make every bad basketball decision in key moments ever. Dude thinks he's the greatest player of all time when in reality he kinda sucks at shooting and should never been taking the last shot. He can't be your number one, and Russ needs to stop thinking he's their number 1. More athleticism in the league than anyone but can't move out of the way of his own basketball IQ."
if thunder still want to compete by trading Westbrook they're claiming him as damaged goods so packages will be worse than his value  Thunder get John Wall and 2019 First  Wizards get Russell Westbrook
Thunder get Mo Bamba Jonathon Isaac and 2019 First  Magic get Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook in my opinion is a top 3 PG but he needs to get his priorities straight. They’re not in it to stat pad. They’re trying to win. His shooting has taken a significant dip for some reason and that reason might be that his form is complete shit. He literally just throws it up with his arms and hopes for the best. He was one of the fastest and strongest players in the league at the PG position with a high iq. Now it feels like he’d rather be Steph then Westbrook Russ and wants to make his stats look good. I mean I don’t mind him hogging the ball if he’s gonna take a high percentage shot but now I feel like I’d rather Schroeder have the ball. This probably won’t happen and idk if Westbrook has a no trade clause, but they should seriously consider making a trade for Anthony Davis with Westbrook added in the package, similar to what the Raptors did in the Kawhi-Derozan trade. That way Schroder, Roberson, George, Grant, Davis. I don’t think OKC will do this but they need to make huge culture changes after failing their goal yet again. OKC is the biggest disappointment in NBA history."
"Kyrie, Kemba, Dame, Russell, Harden  Fox, Westbrook, Steph, Mitchell, McCollum"
"You're a GM, if you could start a team with either of these which would you choose:  21 year old Hakeem Olajuwon   or  20 year old Russell Westbrook + 19 year old Anthony Davis"
"Wall? At this hour?!  Curry, Harden, Paul, Lillard, Kyrie, Kemba, Klay, Beal, Westbrook, Oladipo.   With Simmons, Russell and Holiday as HM"
Russell Westbrook is Josh Smith with a max contract
This is the best thing that has ever happened to Tramel. Westbrook is making more people aware of this dude than his own writing would otherwise warrant. Barry should send Russell a thank you card after the post season is over for them.
"Russell ""MORPH"" Westbrook   Most Over Rated Player in History"
See: Russell Westbrook
You may note that I also don't think Russell Westbrook was ever a top-5 player in the NBA despite his MVP and averaging a triple double for three straight years.
Russell Westbrook is an awful shooter.   Source: my eyes
Russell Westbrook is just a 6’3 athletic freak who plays basketball.
"im not sure why people are saying this is so crazy lol  the warriors quite literally went to 7 games with the rockets and lost because the rockets went on a 0-27 run from three   yeah, downgrading from steph curry to russell westbrook vs a slightly worse rockets team could end in a loss. it also might not. but it's not an extremely scorching take lol"
Russell Westbrook is the most overrated player in the league.   &amp;#x200B;  Change my mind.
"I guess it’s fine to think Russell Westbrook has the better season. The fine lines you put on it don’t really exist. Part of Harden’s team having a better season has to be a credit to Harden.   Hard to buy “meh” as an argument there, too. Westbrook wasn’t clearly the best player. He had the advantage in rebounding, but that’s less meaningful for a guard and Harden was way more efficient."
Reminder the Thunder will never taste Finals with Russell Westbrook.
1. Stephen Curry 2. Damian Lillard 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Chris Paul 6. Kemba Walker 7. Ben Simmons  &amp;#x200B;  Current order IMO. The only real argument for Kyrie over Dame right now is the NBA Finals games that Kyrie has been in.
"Overrated? That'd def be Russell Westbrook. He's the Dan Marino of the NBA. Great stats, disappears in big moments. Can't shoot for shit. Meanwhile Kyrie is not a stat stuffer like those other guys, but in a must-win game, he always rises to the occasion, has incredible efficiency, and is the best dribbler in the league and the best driving PG not named James Harden. He's probably the 3rd or 4th PG I take behind Curry, Harden (if you consider him a PG), and Dame."
"Curry Kyrie Dame Kemba CP3 Westbrook Conley Holiday Wall Russell  Off the top of my head, probably missing some people"
yeah no shit it's about russell westbrook trying to control the narrative because he wants to make sure only positive things are said about him  .. which is a fucking HORRIBLE precedent to set
"WHERE THE FUCK DOES THIS “KD DIDNT WANNA PLAY WITH RUSS” NARRATIVE CAME FROM  KD was claiming on his own fucking burner accounts that it was “Only KD and Russ” not ONCE did he shit on Russ himself. He shitted on the supporting cast, he shitted on the coach. But not ONCE did he say anything about Russell Westbrook himself...   This sub is nothing but low effort, uninformed trash."
You have Paul George and Russell Westbrook... how the fuck do you go down 3-1...
"russell westbrook said ""next question"" to plenty of standard, basketball related questions..."
"&gt;The team doesn’t have the best shooting   Understatement -- they have some of the WORST shooting. They absolutely fucking need shooters. Like, look at their roster (below).

Why doesn't Raymond Felton get to play more minutes?  He was 1/0/2 in 14 minutes but he was +11 during that time which was the highest of any of the OKC players.  It seems like Raymond Felton and Russell Westbrook should be sharing more time instead of Westbrook always getting a lot of minutes and Felton hardly ever getting any minutes
Fun fact that I just remembered and which I'm sure has been mentioned before: Billy Donovan and Russell Westbrook met on opposite sides of the NCAA national championship in 2006 while Russ was a freshman at UCLA and Billy was the coach of Florida.

Rudy Gobert  I know all you steph curry stans are probably going crazy right now but think of it this way, if you took curry off the warriors, away from Draymond and klay who cover up his defensive issues, and put him on any of the other teams with those point guards ahead of them, would the new team hes on do better with him than say lillard, no. Would the celtics be doing better with him instead of kyrie, probably not since he isn't as good in the pick in roll. But for sure if you put lillard or kyrie on the warriors you would have a team that may never lose a game because they dont need the jump shot to be on so they can play good.   When I was making this list, I kept thinking, who do I want to have the ball at the end of the game to win it. So that's one of the reasons why klay is number 5 while others think he should be higher. Hes offensively limited as a scorer and creator. He is a defensive jj Reddick with a post game. The dude cant run a pick and roll, he cant go in iso and make a cross over and pull up, he doesn't have a step back, he cant create space for himself, that's why he and steph are running around screens on the sideline.   Let me know what you guys think and dont be ignorant. Thanks"
Incoming Russell Westbrook 40 point triple double
"He's got the best handles, that's for sure, if you were saying Russell Westbrook this would be a decent argument, but he's definitely better than Lowry, and probably better than Damian Lillard because he shoots a little better. we can't forget that Irving won a 3 point contest. and his inside scoring is not to be messed with, but no, give him a 40 inch vertical and more power and we'll talk... But Curry's shooting has him as king, not even Harden does that crazy crap that consistently"
Raaaaahh I just hate Russell Westbrook so much!
"For a couple of days? Motherfucker, I've been hearing about that Russell Westbrook injury and how dirty Patrick Beverley is from people for *years* now."
"&gt;Do you ever see a Westbrook, Irving, Harden, or Lillard type drive past the initial defender and then get shut down by a help defender  Yes. The reason you dont see it happening in a way that is super obvious is   a) It's hard to pick up on real time.   b) The vast majority of these instances if a star player sees help shaded his way he wont even try to get to the rim(or he will at least delay his attempt).   There's no guard in the NBA on a qualifying sample [who didnt pass out of &gt;1/4 of his drives this year](https://on.nba.com/2UqyGew). Why do you think that is? Mostly its because of help defense. Russell Westbrook in particular got about 3 assists per game just off passes from his drives."
"This is funny. After game 3 a Portland beat writer asked PG about the post buzzer dunk. PG says ""Next question"" and you can then hear Russ say under his breath (but knowing he'd be picked up on the mic) ""shut up"". Seriously, Russell Westbrook is 30 years old. Can any of over 30 imagine a time at work that we would have said/done something like that? Stupid question or not.  Also, wouldn't it be appropriate if you're PG to say something like ""It was a statement. I was fired up and I wanted people to know it."" or whatever it was? I mean I just don't understand professional athletes that don't act professional."

He could be. If you asked me 11 years ago if Russell Westbrook would be an MVP I’d say the same thing.
"Ya know, I already think the self-importance of journalists is a little out of hand. But I give it some room cuz the press is necessary in terms of keeping the public aware, and keeping powerful people in check. But this kind of stuff over sports reporting is absolutely stupid.  I dont need you to interview Russell Westbrook, for me to know how he feels about shooting poorly, or about the team. I watch the game, and the look is all over his face. It's crazy to me that these people think their job matters, when it's literally just filler so that the Oklahoman can print more pages and offer more ad space. If post game interviews didn't exist, literally nothing would change. I don't know how these people started sniffing their farts so hard"
I like how the media made this about them rather than Westbrook having a great game 3. Because we watch Russell Westbrook for post game press conferences
"I don’t understand why this is a big deal at all. I mean I wouldn’t answer the same questions over and over again if I was Westbrook either.  Westbrook didn’t have the greatest shooting season and has had questionable shot selection his whole career, so he has been hearing these same reporters asking the same questions for a long time now. Like how many times can you answer “Seems like another 2-14 night Russell, what can you do to help your shot selection out?”  Id tell them if they were that worried about it tell coach to bench my ass."
"Russell Westbrook, his IQ would be a lot higher and he’d know what to do to keep the team together. I believe his impact would be higher than sending kd or harden back"

[They've been trying to harvest it from fans](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/utah-jazz-fan-permanently-banned-after-verbal-altercation-with-thunders-russell-westbrook)
Didn't Russell Westbroook lose to the poor man's Russell Westbrook in the playoffs last year?
*Russell Westbrook wants to know your location*
Donovan Mitchell is a poor man's Russell Westbrook. Get used to these types of games Utah.
They don't. Read this from 2015.  http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/
I met Russell Westbrook at the club in San Diego once. Couldn’t have been nicer. And I was just a random guy screaming his name over and over. Anyone can give you an anecdotal story about a guy being nice or mean. Stay woke.
"I've seen a lot of hate towards westbrook and a lot of it is warranted. But I do wanna leave something here just to show a different light of westbrook.  During nationally televised games Westbrook can come across as chilly in his sideline interviews. But on local broadcasts his demeanor is much warmer, which is no coincidence. In 2012, Thunder sideline reporter Lesley McCaslin challenged Westbrook on his clipped answers. “I have to ask you these questions,” McCaslin said, “and you’ve got to help me out.”  Westbrook will never be a garrulous speaker, but he respected McCaslin’s candor. During the playoffs last spring McCaslin was pregnant, and Westbrook pestered her about when she was starting maternity leave. She didn’t understand why he was so interested. Finally, after a flight from San Antonio to Oklahoma City, Westbrook led McCaslin through the airport parking lot and popped the trunk of his car. Inside was a Maclaren stroller. “He’s more human than people would ever think,” McCaslin says. “He just doesn’t want you to know that.” When McCaslin thanked Nina for picking out the stroller, soon to be occupied by baby Hunter, Westbrook’s wife laughed. “That wasn’t me,” she said. “That was all Russell.”  This was taken from a SI article by Lee Jenkins."
"The assassination of Russell Westbrook continues. Classic Draymond, with that cheap shot."
Somebody you've never heard of that's chasing clout on the most contentious Russell Westbrook Day yet.
"The Anti-Westbrook train is leaving Oklahoma at breakneck speed, even faster than the coward Kevin Durant left in the summer of 2016. Russell Westbrook’s reputation amongst, and treatment of, members of the media has reached a zenith just as his team sits on the brink of an early postseason exit, no doubt the fault of several hatchet-faced referees, a pinheaded fanbase, and an old sack of oatmeal named Raymond Felton.  Russell Westbrook has been accused of refusing to answer questions from the media, sometimes refusing to even make eye contact. On behalf of all writers, we can barely look at ourselves in a mirror, so why should Russ have to?  Russell Westbrook is having historically bad post season stats, but it’s hard to be efficient at basketball when your hands are busy carrying Paul George, who injured himself at his second job as the inflatable man at a used car dealership, and with both of his eyes trained on Berry Tramel, who looks like if doing Whippits in the back of a 94 Dodge Ram was a person.  Even Steve Kerr has piled on, calling Westbrook’s actions “dangerous to the league.” But the only danger Steve Kerr is an expert in is getting punched in the face by Michael Jordan.  Does Russell Westbrook have a contractual obligation to cooperate with the media? Maybe, but my cousin had a contractual obligation to stay away from the local high school, and now he’s serving 3 to 5 in county. Free Hambone  Does Russell Westbrook have a moral obligation to cooperate with the media? I’m reminded of the old saying “it takes more muscles to smile than it does to frown.” But only at first! Have you seen what 25 years of sadness does to the human body? My grandma is the unhappiest person I’ve ever met and her face looks like a haunted mask from an Indian burial ground. Anyway. MY POINT IS that Russell Westbrook is a smart, handsome and good player, and I say this not just because I’m a fan, but because I am financially invested in gaining access to Russel Westbrook.  If you’re reading this, Russ, I promise to write fawningly about you (triple doubles are underrated! Stat chasing is good!) unflinchingly about your enemies (Why does Pat Beverley look like he should be selling bean pies on the subway?) and most of all, I promise to never subject you to the Ramsey Bolton-esque torture of ever making direct eye contact. I love you Russ."
"The only difference is that the Jordan Brand, and in essence Russell Westbrook, are the ones who made the invite to Knight to come out to interview him so that she could help shill for his new sneaker line. If you think inviting someone over and then treating them like shit is OK then I'd hate to be one of your friends."
"I saw Russell Westbrook at a Whole Foods in Portland yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
*Russell Westbrook has left the chat*
Russell Westbrook is a fucking douchebag. Next question
"So that same team with Westbrook, Lillard, Russell, Walker, Simmons, etc instead of Steph would be unable to come close to what it has done with Steph. That’s laughable."
"[Article](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/patrick-beverley-explains-why-he-doesnt-talk-trash-steph-curry)  &gt;Beverley was then asked to list some of the toughest players to guard.   &gt;   &gt;""Dame (Damian Lillard), he's up there. He's tough,"" Beverley said. ""He's cold within the offense they run, too. He's got the ball but everything ain't for him. You put Dame in Golden State or put Dame in a Houston Rockets type of offense ... I think we're only getting a little bit of a taste.   &gt;   &gt;""Kemba (Walker). Gotta put Russ (Russell Westbrook) up there because you don't know what you're gonna get from Russ. He can go cold for five games and then you play him and he hit five threes.   &gt;   &gt;""I'd put them three for sure."""
"The most incredible thing about the above stats is that Russell Westbrook, one of the worst volume shooters in NBA history, shot 18 threes and then 19 threes in elimination games in the previous two seasons. That is un-fucking-believable. What's more believable is the Thunder lost both of those games."
Russell Westbrook being a stat padder
"Russell Westbrook ever thinking he has any business shooting 19 3s in a game is flat out mind boggling, even if he did make 7 of them"
Russell Westbrook is better than ever
"Absolutely, it’s a game of building stats for Russell.   Which is perfectly okay for him to pursue - it’s bad for the franchise, but Westbrook doesn’t seem to care about that."
"“I think he’s damaged himself and I think he’s damaged the franchise”.   Basically, Tramel thinks he’s relevant because Russell Westbrook doesn’t like him. Little does he know, a lot of people like Westbrook for antics like this."
“You miss 100% of the bad pull up jumpers from beyond your range you jack up early in the shot clock”  -Russell Westbrook in the playoffs.
"They got swept in the Finals, getting there once doesn’t mean much if you can’t compete.   The only argument that holds any water here is that potentially Russ wouldn’t have grown such selfish tendencies with Harden and Durant there together.   Such a shame, Oklahoma City will never see a championship with Russell Westbrook in the city."
"""Can't win with these cats."" - KD  Look at the username... polkCAT.  polkcat = Russell Westbrook confirmed."
Playoff Harden is the most inefficient guard since Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook III is an American professional basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association. He is an eight-time NBA All-Star, and a two-time NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player, winning consecutive awards in 2015 and 2016."
Russell Westbrook
"Yeah my favorite vids are his sway freestyle and Russell Westbrook on a farm. I wish he'd put something out like that soon. Hes funny and people don't take him very seriously, but he seriously has some nutty bars that not anyone else would even think of. That whole sway freestyle is just 3 1/2 min of straight up bars on bars."
"Houston is like Colin Cowherd's version of Russell Westbrook:    - Volatile: It's time to chuck 3's, y'all   - Inflexible: hey, we just missed 10 3's in a row, maybe drive to the hoop?   - Un-coachable: let's go small and keep double teaming Donovan Mitchell to drive left, leaving the lane wide open for put backs."

Russell Westbrook is the most average person to wear compression pants and 2 shooting sleeves in the league
Wait so is Russell Westbrook literally the worst basketball player ever or a possible key piece of a dynasty?
It is hilarious that r/nba thinks liking Russell Westbrook is an unpopular opinion. This sub lacks any self awareness
"Oscar was incredibly efficient for his time - he has a higher TS% than Westbrook despite playing in the league's least efficient era. In fact he led the NBA in TS% over his first decade of playing. In relative terms, imagine if Westbrook shot the ball like Curry. Unsurprisingly his team, which was easily the worst before he arrived, became the best offence over that timespan.  Unfortunately for him the sixties were ruled by defence - specifically Russell and Wilt, who won 9 MVPs surrounding Oscar's. There's only so much a point guard can do on that end."
This dude goes all day and night with Russell Westbrook Jr III on his mind.
Russell Westbrook. Russell Westbrook. Russell Westbrook.
"So your main reason for liking Russell Westbrook is because his wife is not as attractive as models but is still devoted to her? And because she turned down a model?  Two of your reasons are basically that his teammates like him, so you also like him.  Russ is one of my favorite players–although this series on and off the court has seriously disappointed me–but those are some terrible reasons and are not convincing."
Because kanter was “unplayable” against james harden in the pick and roll.  This is Russell Westbrook.
Maybe he should be fired... no wait the thunder struggles are all on Russell Westbrook and nobody else in that organization deserves any blame
"I think everyone would be happier overall if Russell Westbrook returned to form but talked like 90% less shit on likable players. He's fun to watch when he's on, but he loses me with some of the things he does to fire himself up (?)   I think we can all agree that talking shit and scuffling with Ricky Rubio and Damian Lillard doesn't endear you to many people. Talk all the shit you want to Patrick Beverly because even if you don't think he's dirty, you can probably agree that Beverly invites the trash talk."
Donovan Mitchell is a world apart from Russell Westbrook and it's honestly been that way since the middle of last season
"Apparently Russell Westbrook is the worst player in the NBA now, so that's one guard spot in the West opened up."
James “Russell Westbrook” Harden
"Allen Iverson didn't really have a choice and his impact goes farther than stats show Kobe, well Donovan Mitchell no reason Russell Westbrook he can't shoot really well"
"i totally disagree, [check it out](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id1_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y1=2016&amp;player_id1=westbru01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id2_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y2=2016&amp;player_id2=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id3_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y3=2016&amp;player_id3=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id4_select=LeBron+James&amp;y4=2016&amp;player_id4=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id5_hint=Kyrie+Irving&amp;player_id5_select=Kyrie+Irving&amp;y5=2016&amp;player_id5=irvinky01&amp;idx=players)"

I think Russell Westbrook is the most average player to ever record three triple-double seasons
Is it just me or do Russell Westbrook and the Thunder as a whole seem cursed?
"Literally every teammate that has ever been asked has said Russell Westbrook is the best teammate, so your perception of him being a bad teammate is foundless. You're also confusing competivitveness as being an asshole. He has respect for most players, like Dame and Harden, but when the game is on they're not friends. They're trying to stop him from winning. He shouldn't be friendly"
RUSSELL WESTBROOK
Giannis goes to the Russell Westbrook school of thinking that he can shoot 3's.
Russell Westbrook has been a worse player than Paul George this season.  Westbrook has declined badly as a scorer while George has improved significantly as an offensive player.
"There was once a time when people would call Russell Westbrook the next coming of Kobe.  So I guess the good thing is, there no need anymore for that comparison - now we know for sure he's no Kobe! Not even in the same zip code.  That should take all the pressure off his shoulders, and makes it easier for the rest of us to categorize the basketball player pyramid of excellence. Win win for everyone!"
"I think that getting legitimately upset/mad at your own teammates for saying hi and being friendly to the opponent who is their good friend makes Russell Westbrook a trash teammate.  Not a trash basketball player, but most definitely a trash teammate."
Russell Westbrook kicks ball away from Damian Lillard’s hands as he’s trying to pick it up   https://youtu.be/zaih4A0gtjU
"""Is russell westbrook retarded"""
"The issue with your argument is that no star in the league gets a perfect group of guys tailor made to fit them. What winning stars do is craft the guys they get into the guys they need. When the Thunder are a constant revolving door of solid guys who suddenly look underwhelming on OKC, we have to find the common denominator, and that is Russell Westbrook."
"Way to vastly over simplify and exaggerate what I'm saying. I'm not saying ""when his shots go in he's good and when they don't he's bad."" I'm saying he's gonna go out there and fire up a ton of jumpshots even though he's proven he's a really, really poor shooter, and on the rare occasion when he hits a bunch of them he'll strut around like that's the player he always is. But the reality is he often throws up a ton of bricks and it severely hurts his team.  Take any team and identify the worst shooter, and now imagine that almost every single game that player takes if not the most shots on the team, very close to it. Will there be occasional games where they defy the odds and shoot well? Sure. But what about all the other games where they stick to their percentages and just miss all over the floor? It's not tough to imagine what one player playing like that can do to your team's chances of success.   People often focus on Westbrook's shooting percentage, but I'm always more baffled by his *attempts*. Russell Westbrook has shot less than 30% from 3 in 4 of the last 5 seasons, and every year he's done it on a high volume of shots. That's pretty unequivocally a poor shooter, historically so, in fact. And yet, in the elimination game against Utah last year, Westbrook took [a whopping 19 threes](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201804270UTA.html) in that game. His defenders have long said ""yes, but he made 7 of them, that's hitting at a league average rate!"" But I still return to the fact that with the season on the line, arguably the worst volume shooter in the league (possibly in league history) attempted 19 three pointers all by himself. If he'd hit a few more of his shots maybe they'd have won the game and people would have thought he was heroic (many did anyway), but the process by which he arrived at the conclusion that he should be shooting it that often is broken. And that's my point."
"I mean, Westbrook isn't even the best player on his own team and he's still never won 50 games without Durant.  He's overrated as fuck.  A historical stat padder who shoots inefficiently and controls the ball on an obscene level.  I'm a Celtic fan but even when Kyrie was on the Cavs I said I'd take him over Westbrook.  I've also said multiple times that I honestly think hypothetically swapping Damian Lillard for Russell Westbrook would result in the Blazers getting worse and the Thunder getting better.  Count me as someone not even minimally surprised to be seeing Lillard owning Westbrook in this series."
"&gt;Westbrook rarely wastes an entire flight asleep; instead, he studies game footage on an iPad. And if he notices a teammate consistently out of place during games, he'll slide into the seat next to them and wake them up (or send an assistant to do the same) to review and correct the error.

"I think everyone has this in reverse. Russell Westbrook was never that good, and only became a superstar by playing hard. The problem is playing hard can only take you so far.   He never had a shot or great touch at the rim. Also not a great defender, which require a great understanding of angles and timing. He’s able to put up numbers through will alone. He should have never gotten this contract. He’s outplayed his talent level his entire career and now is getting killed for it."
"Russell Westbrook is still excellent, there’s just a tier of players better than him"
"This is the only one that I remember:  &gt;""One night, a game ran late,” Curtis writes. “Darnell Mayberry, the Oklahoman’s senior Thunder reporter, was up against deadline. He brought his laptop into the locker room to move quotes directly from the players’ lips to his copy.   &gt;Mayberry sat in a chair in front of an empty locker. Westbrook saw him and told him the chairs were for players only. “Mayberry got up. But then a funny thing happened. Backup point guard Reggie Jackson took his chair, wheeled it across the locker room, and offered it to Mayberry.

"Three coaches in franchise history: Carlesimo (who was the carry-over from Seattle) &amp; held that position for less than a quarter of a year. And the last two coaches of our franchise, Brooks &amp; Donovan had/have been a part of the team for 7 years and 4 years, respectively.   Assuming the worst for Donovan, which would mean getting fired following this season, we're looking at around a 3-5 year average for an OKC coach (under Presti's watch). There's no ideal scenario in which a coach can be brought on board now and fired within two years.  This hire should be someone you're expecting to coach him for the next 3-4 years+, which yes, would spell the end of Russ' career, he'd be at the end of his supermax and nearing retirement, at age 34.

"It's hardly hindsight. I challenged people to explain why OKC was a legitimate top tier team and all I got was ""Russell Westbrook averages a triple double and PG is a DPOY"". None of that tells me anything about how effective the team is in a playoffs situation"
"Are you dumb? Okafor is averaging 18 and 10 per 36 minutes while not being able to receive the ball as much as he deserves. Imagine next year with Davis out of the way, Randle and Okafor will have unlimited touches. You’re just sleeping on Okafor and you jus assume he’s a bust because everyone else does. However there’s another guy who everyone thought would be a bust and then proved those people wrong at 23. His name’s D’angelo Russell and he’s an all star. I assume you know that because you know everything about the NBA right. Let’s not forgot Julius Randle is only 24 and is averaging 20 and 8 which is 25 and 10 per 36. Ik per 36 isn’t always accurate but it’s something to think about. Jrue Holiday is a borderline all star.   I don’t believe Westbrook’s value is close to equivalent to AD’s however it’s probably the best deal they can get with Randle and Okafor succeeding. Westbrook will make them a playoff team without a doubt and these guys will get valuable playoff experience. Winning attracts free agents so the Pelicans could add another free agent to the roster."

"*""Ja Morant can be anyone, maybe even Russell Westbrook""*  - ~~Peter Griffin~~ /u/Honk4Tits  It might have been overkill, so maybe swap Bridges for TJ (who necessitates the 2020 pick because of how bad he is) but if you don't realize how badly the Suns want to be good, then you have no idea what you're talking about. An owner trying to get a new stadium built would rather have Russ over **anyone** other than maybe Zion. Booker would love a pg that will pass him open 10 times a game."

Tbh I haven’t seen much of “Westbrook sucks” talk. I really just see criticism of him within discussions of comparing him to elite players. A lot of very good players make their teammates better but it doesn’t make them elite or capable of leading a team to a ring.   The common sentiment is that Russell is not good enough to lead a team in today’s NBA deep into the playoffs let alone a chip. He can make his teammates better without making that second statement untrue. So far that is getting proven to be true in these playoffs as well as the past few.
"Russell Westbrook is like the serial killer next door. Sure, he keeps his lawn manicured and helps with the overall aesthetic of the neighborhood, but he constantly murders people"

"Trade Russell Westbrook to PHX for their pick this year, Mikal Bridges, TJ Warren and a lotto protected pick in 2020  Fire Donovan and replace him with Becky Hammond  Trade Paul George to LAL for Lonzo, Kuzma and the Laker pick this year.  **Lonzo, Bridges, RJ Barrett, Kuzma, Adams** as the starting line up. Bridges and Lakers pick coming off the bench with Grant. A future PHX pick and no salary allows OKC to completely rebuild on the fly for contention in 2021 and beyond."
"Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony are the 2 most overrated players of the last 16 years. Yeah they’re all star caliber players who can fill a stat sheet, but they’re not players you can build around and make deep playoff runs."
That’s a terrible analogy Russell Westbrook is criticized all the time he’s considered overrated. Personally I love him however there’s no denying he hasn’t been playing great against Portland. With that being said this fuss about him not answering questions is ridiculous. He doesn’t owe the media anything he doesn’t owe them answers. Should athletes have strong mentalities? Yes however even the strongest of people isn’t going to be in the mood for answering questions after a tough loss or after a bad day. Popovich won’t answer questions even on a good day and we love him for that. We can criticize how he’s played but this outrage over the lack of answers is silly.

"PG had one devasting injury 5 years ago, only played 9 games. But the last 4 seasons, he's played the most games out of anyone.  My question to people who take Bron/ad is this. Kawhi and Bron have been the leader on teams that have won the chip. PG had been the leader in teams that got to the ecf (before they ran into the super team heat).   AD has only made the playoffs twice, with a 5-8 record. He gets his stats better then anyone, but stats don't mean playoff success. Just ask Russell Westbrook. So what makes him more valuable? If possible, I'd like to hear an argument for this that doesn't include age since we're talking about a 3 year window where all of these players (except maybe LeBron) are in their prime."

"Actually, growing up in Oklahoma as a child, I was an Orlando Magic and Penny fan in theb 90s so I've already been through the expansion team rebuild + superstar snek teammate + and highly underappreciated athletic point guard thing once before.   The only difference between then and now I would say is that Russell Westbrook and James Harden represented urban culture while living amongst conservatives that shun any aspect of that lifestyle religiously. I always saw Russ as a much needed shining light for my ex/childhood homestate. It gave me some hope that people who are different in Oklahoma wont be treated as demons and savages with all of the accomplishments he made with his style and attitude. It would have meant so much to see him win a championship here and also play his entire career in that OKC uniform."
Yes but plot twist you cannot win with Russell Westbrook. Certainly PG as the second star wasn’t gonna do it. This was a disaster for OKC from a narrative perspective of having the only star they ever acquired not via draft leave them for LA but that team had a ceiling and now it’s over so long term it’s good

Russell Westbrook will definitely not net the thunder two first round picks.

"Here’s a long winded (to the best of my ability) honest review of him. From a  whole time Thunder fan. I’m critical of him. More so than most our fans but I do love what he brings as well. Anyways.   His strengths mainly revolve around sheer athleticism and ability to keep the pace of the game up at top notch for the whole time he’s on the floor. He doesn’t beat you with smarts. He beats you by running the opposition into the ground. He runs as hard on the last play of the game as he did on the first play. Everything is Game 7 of the finals to him. Which is great.  He’s disrespected for his playmaking ability. People see the 10 assists and say he chases triple doubles. But that’s one thing I don’t agree with. Westbrook really does have eyes all over the floor and sees angles many guards don’t.  Though ball dominant, he really is a serious passer who is lethal finding big men on the pick n roll (would have been good if Whiteside was there tbh.) he’s also really good at drawing defenders on dribble drives. And is a willing lob man for Centers and is more than willing passer to 3 point shooters. We in OKC never surrounded him with 3 point shooters. But if Miami has guys like Olynyk, Butler, Meyers Leonard, Herro and whoever else getting minutes, they’ll see a spike in their production from deep based on how open they are when their man helps on Westbrook.   He’s also a guy who has his players backs. He put Curry on his ass and was looking to snatch the soul off any Warrior player that wanted it one night. All because Semaj Christon (3rd string PG) got bumped by Curry. He genuinely treats the 2 way players the same way he treats the all stars. Russ is a great team mate who goes to war for his guys and always has time to teach them and help them grow. Contrary to people’s beliefs.   The negatives exist too.   Firstly. My biggest knock on him is Defense. Off ball. On ball. Fighting through screens. Alll of it. It’s just laziness. He was DPOY in college. But no longer tries. At all. He’s often beaten by lesser guards on drives. He has a strong tendency to play with a “fuck it. There’s help defense” mentality. But when help goes to his man. He just stands around and leaves the next guy wide open. Once he’s burnt one on one. He quits on the play and sits under the glass waiting for a board. That’s not okay.   He gets absolutely murdered on pick and rolls because no matter how good the shooter is. He ALWAYS goes UNDER screens or selfishly calls switches and outs his big man out on guard island. Which never Ends well. Either the guard blows by Steve or they feed it to the 7 footer to man handle Russ. Russ either could or concedes open layups (foul trouble sometimes happens when teams pick at that seam). He gets steals. But that’s purely because of athleticism and reach. Not high intensity defense. Very rarely steals the ball. Just gets intercepts on passes. One of the more annoying things about him is that he can play lockdown D but he only plays hard on Curry, Chris Paul and Pat Beverly because of previous beef with them. He’s been lit up by guys like Yogi Ferrell, Seth Curry, Frank Mason, JJ barea and a few other mediocre match ups that he refused to show respect. So yeah. The lack of fucks on D is sometimes infuriating.   His shooting is what the numbers say. He is to easy to get into the head of. Every time you see someone get into a shit talk battle. His alpha mentality kicks in. He starts to take over and just shoots brick after brick. He’s a surprisingly good catch and shoot guy. But he never does it. And that’s because he’s ALWAYS dribbling rather than moving without the ball. He’s not a bricklayer when he shoots off a catch but for some reason even if he catches an open pass. He always throws a shot fake or dribbles till a defender comes. Then shoots contested long twos.   His free throw shooting is dreadful for god knows what reason. He’s a career 81% shooter. But shot it at something like 72% and 65% the last two years.   In summary. He’ll give you all he’s got. But you’ve gotta take the bad decisions and lazy defensive intensity of you want the brilliant play making, energetic offensive runs and the teachings and team mate chemistry he offers.   If Miami can land him. He will do wel and he will thrive. I just hope that Riley and Spo and even Jimmy are willing to hold him more accountable for offensive efficiency and defensive engagement. The sky is the limit with a fully engaged Russell Westbrook."

"I don’t agree, Russell Westbrook is a good player but he is very inefficient. His playing style imo would only make it more difficult to win. Not to mention, the Raptors would most likely give up a lot for a franchise player like Westbrook."

People were always like, why is Westbrook shooting more than Durant, which while true still seems deeply silly in retrospect.  &amp;#x200B;  2) When people did blame Durant... Durant was the best player on the team, he gets more blame, fair or not.  &amp;#x200B;  3) Westbrook cares about stats too much... Ummm... KD has talked about the 50-40-90 thing. All players care about stats. Westbrook, to his credit, has ruined our understanding of the triple-double stat. And yeah, during that whole run, reporters were complaining about what they saw as stat chasing on Westbrook's part. Okay, you find a teammate who didn't love Russ and enjoyed helping him get that achievement, than I suppose you can talk.  4) Last year, Westbrook absolutely got the blame for being inefficient and trying to do too much. Also Paul George disappeared after like Game 2-3 (injuries probably)...   5) This year, I'm pretty sure people blamed Paul George getting hurt for them collapsing, not Paul George specifically.  &amp;#x200B;  Look I like Russell Westbrook a lot, flaws and all. But the idea he doesn't get blame is absolutely wrong. People have written about his lapses on defense, his declining athelticism, and his inefficiency his entire career."

Nash won because he ran one of the best offenses in NBA history while being super efficient which has a ton to do with being good at basketball.   Here’s the bottom line, Russell Westbrook has never been a top 5 player. He was never even close, and now he’s an aging player who can’t shoot and relies on athleticism. He’s not valuable at all right now, and the team that trades for him is getting the 2nd worst contract in the NBA."

When you read OKC and you expect it to be a Russell Westbrook trade
You know nothing the Miami Heat will lose all cap flexibility if we trade for Russell Westbrook as we stand now we'll have enough cap space for two max contracts in 2021; that's better than an inefficient stat padder like Russell Westbrook who has shot under 40% in the playoffs the last three seasons.
[Lowe] Russell Westbrook ate my child. Ridiculous!
"The most likely 10 MVP candidates, in my book, are:  1) Lebron James 2) Kawhi Leonard 3) Giannis  4) James Harden 5) Anthony Davis 6) Joel Embiid 7) Steph Curry 8) Jokic  9) Paul George  10) Russell Westbrook   So if “dark horse” is outside the top 5, I think Steph and Embiid are being slept on. Steph because if the Warriors manage to stay in the top 2-3 in the west he is getting the MVP barring a killer season by player on a 1 seed. Embiid because his season last year was not far off. If he works on his diet, stays healthy, and the 76ers perform as expected, he will be in the runnings.   If “dark horse” is outside of the top 10, then I think the best bets are: Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Kemba Walker, and Kyrie Irving."

"&gt;All eight incumbent Western Conference playoff teams have a case to make it again, unless and until the Oklahoma City Thunder trade Russell Westbrook. (It feels mean to label Westbrook a ""loser"" here after doing so following another first-round flameout. It's also unavoidable. The Thunder have won zero playoff series since Durant left. They still have the same issues on offense despite at least five years of empty rhetoric -- aimed at Westbrook -- about adjusting. Another star left him. It's not great.)  What about that?"
"PG-13 was already a good second fiddle to a inefficient Russell Westbrook with him jacking up a lot of shots (love Russ but that's who he is), and was top 3 in MVP voting despite being a second fiddle. And Kawhi is not a guy who demands to have the ball every time and is completely fine with not being relied heavily upon to make up an offense. I think both of those guys are good match but will be interesting to see how they distribute the ball with each other and to other guys, like Lou and Harrell."

"TL;DR: You have ignored many good things about him to talk about his negative traits. You choose the negative side of any evidence to be interpreted. How is that not inherently hating?   You clearly at the very least gear some sort of negative bias towards him, because you automatically go to exactly what a person that ""hates"" would say, which is that his stats are pointless, he's a detrimental person etc.  Like for example, take your paragraph that Russ is ""at this best on a team that lets him do it all"". That's just a ridiculous paragraph in general, because he got to *3 WCF and 1 NBA FINALS* appearances with KD, so calling him a second option requires  A STUPID OBJECTIVE REJECTION OF BASIC FACTS, or just hate. So we assume you're hating, and not just stupid.   PG13 had his best season with Russ, Oladipo had a few years in Orlando where he failed to show any sort of potential, goes through WB and becomes an All-Star and compliments him on his work ethic and states that he was a big reason in his ability to lead a team.  Whether you see that as evidence of ""leave WB and get better"", or ""teammates leave him and get better because he HELPS THEM"" is up to you. It's two different interpretations of the same thing, and is skewed to whether you have a negative bias ""hate"" or a positive bias ""like"". You have clearly taken the former option.  So, TL;DR because I'm sick of writing more: Russell Westbrook OBJECTIVELY does great wonders for any team he's on, averaging 10+ assists (how the fuck do you call him a selfish player with that? Are you stupid?) and putting up a great amount of points. At the very least, he's proven himself to be a capable 1A option to a winning team. I ranted more with this, because you *clearly* have a negative opinion of him that skews many viewpoints of him. You argue for his bad points, but make no consideration to argue what makes him a good player."

"Russell Westbrook has no say till free agency, not everyone is Davis"
"Not so recently, I believe. Can't wait for OKC with KD, Harden and Russell Westbrook! to win Game 2 of the NBA Finals!   #ThunderUp 1-0"
Russell Westbrook plays with raw emotion. Many times that raw emotion makes him take awful shots based on nothing but anger. He literally hurts his team because he occasionally has the emotional impulsivity of a teenager.  He should probably start being a professional.
"Nikola Jokic - Budding star with handles, passing, a great eye for the game, etc.  Russell Westbrook - obvious. Game changing legend, etc.  Paul George - MVP caliber player, we all watched him last season didn't we?  Kyrie Irving - iconic shot, multiple time all star, first option to KD in the Nets, easy to see why. Clutch, great leader, scorer, passer, unselfish, well-rounded and amazing.   Lebron James - It's Lebron James, pretty obvious.  Tossed up between KD, Klay, Kawhi and Steph but these are my five."
"There is zero chance that OKC trades Russell Westbrook to the Heat without getting 1 or 2 of Winslow, Herro and Bam. Most likely scenario would be Winslow + Herro.   There's a reason why the Heat haven't signed Herro yet. He can't be traded for 30 days once he signs. But if he doesn't sign, he can be traded immediately.   If it's just a two team trade, expect Russ for Dragic, Winslow, Herro with both teams adding filler to match salary."
"man, if only there was a stat that summarised all shooting percentages in terms of efficiency...  and who in their right mind thinks Conley is about equal to Russell? Maybe if you absolutely don't care about defence or how a team runs. And that's the issue with Harden and Westbrook (and Kyrie to an extent). They don't really involve their team. Westbrook gets away with it a little, because Adams isn't the type to want a play for him or do anything but the dirty work to remain focused, but beyond that? You have a bunch of guys just watching someone iso an entire game, hoping that'll do it. It disengages players from the game. And once everybody is ice cold but the hot hand, then you gotta rely on guys not having done shit to suddenly take on the entire offensive load."
"Of course he played a part but KD was by far the biggest reason he made it. I know Harden wasn't the same player but he was good as fuck and outperformed Westbrook in the WCF. If Russell is so good, how come he couldn't get out of the first round with PG two years in a row? He's just so obviously not a top 10 player but OKC fans can't deal with it."
Russell WestBrook?
"Turnovers per possession used or per time of possession is a better measure. Russell probably makes like 50% of all passes when he's on the floor and takes 30% of all  shots. Anyone who does that will have a large share of the team's turnovers. Rebounding also is part of that equation of predicting wins, and we know Westbrook rocks there.  I would never trade for the guy, but you seem to consider him a trash player, which imo is a drastic overstatement. His team still won a ton of games with him dominating their offense."

"Is this a Russell Westbrook appreciation thread? Because I'm here for it. Nobody plays with his energy. I don't care if he takes inefficient shots, he makes up for it through other aspects of his game.  He's the reason I fell in love with basketball, let alone the Thunder. He's an amazing athlete and people love to shit on his basketball IQ like he doesn't find the open man on a regular basis. He leads the league in assists because he's trying to conform his playstyle to a much more passive role and at times that's not the best plan for the team. I mean he dragged the lifeless corpse of the 2017 Thunder to the playoffs by himself, a feat that he still gets shit on for.  I love Westbrook"
"It’s more than just the routine that’s fucked up I agree, some other shits going on in his head  BUT Russell Westbrook is a creature of habit, doing shit like having the same sandwich cut the same way before games.

Dunks are great, but beating his man with that lightning-fast first step is where Westbrook has always thrived, and I think will be the first thing affected by his eventual decline.  You're giving me these examples of guards who fell off, but how many of them have chronic injuries directly related to their decline? Russell is not injured! This is apples to oranges lol.   And as I VERY clearly detailed, AI was AVERAGING like 42-43 minutes a game for a decade. Of course he's going to fall off before Westbrook will, barring an unforeseen injury. The main point is that even with a substantially heavier burden, AI didn't decline until he was many years older than Russ is now, 30. However, you're saying you have some sort of sixth sense where you can tell Russ has started some sort of early decline because he didn't dunk as much last year.  That's just silly, man. You can maintain that his contract will be worth less at the end of it, I tend to agree, such is the way of supermax contracts. But you've chosen ""Russ is already declining"" as your hill to die on, and it's ridiculous."
Russell Westbrook would be the best player they've gotten since LeBron James. Who gives a flying fuck about Winslow or some rookie?
"Wtf am I reading???  Some no name rookie and Justice no shot Winslow for Russell fucking Westbrook and that's no deal??  You're telling me a combo of Russ, Butler, and Bam isn't good enough?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills"
"How is being a top 8-10 teams not a contender? If by contender you mean, "" has a realistic chance to win the championship"", that has until this year meant basically 2-3 teams.  Moreover, even if you broaden that definition somewhat, you are basically limiting to teams that already have a ball-dominant superstar which largely makes Westbrook redundant, making him a worse choice than Klay, but not a lesser talent.  Especially since most of those teams have a superstar guard. For example, the Cavs of 2017 would rather have had a guy like JJ Redick than Westbrook. Not because Reddick is or has even been a better player, but because they already had Kyrie.   So your question is completely flawed since you are basically asking who is a better complementary role player, not who is better or more talented. If we are talking about the latter, I stand by my original comment. Klay is NOT better than Russell Westbrook."
Roster move #1: Trade Russell Westbrook for Thon Maker   Roster Mover #2: Offer Ron Baker a 5 year supermax contract
Nowhere with Russell Westbrook and his contract
"I disagree strongly, it's his contract that makes Russ a bad move, not him so much.  Westbrook's contract makes getting talent around him difficult because salary caps make it zero sum. Add in that fact that he's an extremely ball dominant and high shooting volume player, makes it even less likely for people to want to play with him and even more likely that the team will end up in mediocrity. Is Russell Westbrook an incredible talent? Yes, 100%.  But he simply cannot carry a team beyond mediocrity at best (this is inarguable at this point). There are only a handful that can.   If you take that contract, then you have to accept the criticisms and responsibilities of a contract that is effectively more than a third of a team's cap."
" Westbrook ain’t tier 1 unless we’re talking about “10+ points, 10+ rebounds, less than 10 assists” Russell Westbrook."
"Most of the all time greats had a teammate at about Pippen's level, they just weren't able to dominate the way Jordan/Pippen could. Some comparable combos where they had a top 3-10 player as a teammate:  - Kevin Durant had Russell Westbrook  - Shaq had Kobe, DWade, and to a lesser extent Penny - Lebron James had Dwayne Wade and now has Anthony Davis - Kobe had Shaq - Kareem had Magic and vice-versa  And then all of the other greats (outside of maybe Hakeem) had all time great teams with multiple all stars rather than 1 other top 5-7 sidekick:  Duncan with Parker/Ginobli/solid role players Bird's Celtics with Mchale/Parish/solid role players Lebron's Heat with Wade/Bosh Lebron's Cavs with Kyrie/KLove/shooters Magics Lakers with Kareem/Worthy"
"Wall, Westbrook, Lowry, and D'Angelo Russell are the ones that come to mind immediately. I probably missed a few."
the teams that have Russell Westbrook will make the finals
"The Thunder for sure. Russell Westbrook would never pass to another Westbrook because they're competing with each other, so they're assists would never be to each other. 1 Russell Westbrook is a gaurenteed 25-10-10. This means with 50 pts and 20 assits not to each other, two players will produce around 100 pts. The rest of the team just has to take a shit and they'll win."
I got confused by the title and thought the Nets had traded Durant for Russell Westbrook lmao

Imagine thinking you could trade Russell Westbrook and some firsts for Tacko.   This league is about stars and four quarters don’t equal a dollar.
"&gt; statistics show his TS is going down more every year   &gt; we can conclude he’s declining as a jump shooter  &gt; so he becomes more involved in playmaking and rebounding to combat that  &gt; he’s still Russell Westbrook so he continues to put up a lot of shots   He had a better season because he was a better shooter then, duh lmfao   Now he’s not but he uses his playmaking to try to make up that difference. He had a worse season because of injuries and bad shooting. He had a better season in 2015 because he was a better shooter then. I don’t think that needs to be explained but there you go lol  Once again, triple doubles have nothing to do with it. And if contracts are consistent, any team in the league would pick up someone who averages 25/10/10 on 51 TS than someone who averages 16/4/3 on 58 TS.  This is because triple doubles are more valuable than efficiency. Triple doubles affect three different parts of basketball while shooting efficiency only affects one."
"&gt; That his teams lose series that they should win because of him.  This is literally true and is exactly what I responded to. One of your players taking 22 shots a game with terrible shot selection and making 8 of them is the definition of losing your team the game. Playing terrible defense for the entire series is the definition of losing your team the game. Taking early shot clock terrible pull-up 3 pointers while shooting the one of the worst volume-adjusted three point percentages in history is the definition of losing your team a series. Superstars can underperformed and lose team series' at the same time, they're not completely independent concepts like you seem to think. Ask Lakers fans how many games Kobe lost them post-Achilles tear with his terrible shot selection.   This has absolutely nothing to do with the original post that ""Russell Westbrook doesn't fit in the modern nba"" and I didn't even mention it once. Just because you had a poor response to the other guy doesn't mean I agree with him that Russ doesn't work in the modern nba. Just calling you out because your response isn't true."
Because Russell Westbrook has value (shocker I know)
Russell Westbrook is a fantastic player and it’s their decision where to send him and for what price. That’s how.
"http://tradenba.com/trades/SytdFWHbB  &gt;Timberwolves receive: Kyle Lowry, Serge Ibaka, Steven Adam's  Massive upgrade from Teague in Kyle Lowry who is also on an expiring deal. Ibaka is an expiring as well and would be great depth behind KAT, who can slide over to the 4 with the addition of Adams. Wolves get the best overall haul, get out from under the Wiggins contract and become contenders in the West with plenty of cap opening up in 2020.   &gt;Thunder receive: Andrew Wiggins, Jeff Teague, Norman Powell, Toronto 2020 round 1 pick, Minnesota 2020 round 1 pick, Minnesota 2021 round 2 pick  Wiggins becomes the ultimate tank commander on a team that will have minimal pressure and tons of shots opening up. Teague is an expiring and a good player for Shai to learn from. Norman Powell is on a decent contract and provides frontcourt depth with Adams leaving town.  &gt;Raptors receive: Russell Westbrook, Robert Covington, Gieuorgi Dieng, Timberwolves 2022 round 1 pick  Kyle leaving town sounds blasphemous, but he'd make the Timberwolves a contender with the other pieces going there. Taking on Russ obviously kills the 2020 cap room Toronto was set to have with Ibaka and Lowry coming off the books, but the 2020 free agent class isn't looking too appealing anyways and bringing in Russ, even on that contract, helps keep them competitive in the wide open east. RoCo slide in as a defensive force on the wing to help minimize the impact of Kawhi leaving. Dieng is cap filler. Timberwolves send back a first as well as part of the price of moving Wiggins and gaining all the 2020 cap room Toronto would have had."
"No, I'm six years older than him. When I was six, I had to go to the hospital in Long Beach, California.   I remember I was leaving the hospital and I saw a baby. I came near him and I pat on his back and I say ""Hello, little baby"" and he puked his guts out on me. That little bastard. Her mother said ""Oh, Russell, no"". It was Russell Westbrook. I've been hating him for 30 years."
imagine russell westbrook being encouraged to shoot threes
"I’m not really a CP3 hater but an argument can be made for him being out of the top 5 from the following PG’s.   Harden, Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Kemba, Woke God (Kyrie), Simmons, Russell, Conley?"
"Russell Westbrook is without a doubt the most polarizing player in the NBA. One thing that drives me nuts whenever he gets discussed is that people somehow hate him because they don’t like him as a player. That’s dumb as hell and it’s probably the only thing Russ defenders have on their side when the ‘debate’ doesn’t go their way.  Russ hasn’t done anything to my knowledge, of being worthy of hate. He seems like a good dad, he’s been loyal to his franchise and he ALWAYS competes hard. His attitude and work ethic is GOAT worthy. Where the issues come in his HOW he plays.  Let’s go through this logically. Top 10 players in the league are in no particular order: Lebron, Kawhi, KD, Steph, AD, PG, James Harden, Giannis, Embiid, Lillard.  (That’s already 3 PG’s that are better than him)  Here’s the rest of the top players, again in no particular order.  Klay, KAT, Jokic, Kyrie, Jimmy, Gobert, Blake.  That’s 17 players who I believe are clearly better than RW. They are ALL either more efficient than he is, much better defenders, or can do it all without bringing detriment to their respective teams.  Next are some players that are more comparable with Russ.  Kemba, Beal, Conley, Jrue Holiday, Oladipo and others I believe you could at least superficially ARGUE Russ is better than.  But again, Russ is more inefficient than any of them.  Russ is at his best on a team that lets him do it all because he can’t fit into a role like say DWade as a secondary scoring option. He’s had KD, PG13 and Oladipo and failed to fit in next to either of them. He failed to let his teams reach their highest potential because he refused to let go and shot more than any of them when he should have been facilitating the ball towards them.  Russ is a very polarizing figure for this reason. Because when he is given all the responsibility he can do astounding things. However, that inflicts a hard ceiling on his teams that doesn’t let them succeed. However, since 2012 Russ has been unable to be a TEAM player, he couldn’t individually succeed as anything other than the most ball and shot dominant player on his teams.  Paul George CHOSE to leave Russ. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t hate him, but knows that Russ’s style isn’t conducive to win a championship.  Kevin Durant CHOSE to leave Russ. Went out like a bitch, but left him because of Basketball reasons. Not personal reasons."
"Never heard people pick Westbrook or AI as the goat point guard. Center I feel like is a much bigger grey area between Wilt, Russell, Kareem, Hakeem, Shaq, etc."
The only thing the guy is good at is dancing with Russell Westbrook.
PG- Russell Westbrook SG- Kyrie Irving SF- Caris LeVert PF- Kevin Durant C- DeAndre Jordan
"Bucks and Sonics/Thunder have nasty lineups as well.  Oscar Robertson, Sidney Moncrief, Ray Allen, Giannis, Kareem  Gary Payton, Russell Westbrook, Ray Allen/James Harden, Kevin Durant, Shawn Kemp"
The Miami pick that the Clippers acquired for Taking on Harkless?  The Golden State pick that Memphis acquired for taking on Iggy?  Could also facilitate the Russell Westbrook trade which would net you a pick as well.
Lmfao I guess a couple summer games is more valuable than Russell Westbrook.
I still can’t believe Tyler Herro is the reason the heat won’t get Russell westbrook
"Well, in an ideal world, they'd get this trade done for like Dragic + Leonard + some sweetner.  I mean if I'm OKC, getting the expirings, getting off Westbrook's contract, and being perceived as having treated Westbrook respectfully and right in the process is plenty for me.   So something like removing the pick protections to the 2023 draft pick and Tyler Herro is probably enough. Maybe Derrick Jones Jr too?  Either way, I can easily see Miami holding onto Justice Winslow, Kelly Olynyk, and Dion Waiters because OKC doesn't want the 2nd year of salary they all have for players that don't meet their timeline. And I get that's not a murder's row, but those are competent players and not vet minimum guys.   That one that'll be hard for them to retain is Adebayo and I wouldn't be surprised to hear that he's the sticking point in the trade being done today. That's probably the best player OKC is likely to get out of this trade and he fits their timeline okayish, but he is also someone that can help Miami out this year and has a future with them too.   But if Miami survives this trade with, say  * Guards - Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, Dion Waiters  * Forwards - Justise Winslow, Derrick Jones Jr. , James Johnson  * Centers - Kelly Olynyk, Bam Adebayo  I mean that's a credible 8 deep. I mean it's clearly better than the team that won 39 games last year, so it's definitely a playoff team. And while they're obviously not better than the Pacers, 76ers, or Bucks, I would bet on them before I bet on Orlando, probably better than the Pistons, may be better than the Nets next year at least (before Durant comes back).  4th/5th in the East for the next couple of years isn't the worst fate on earth."
"I opened this reading Russell as Russell Westbrook and was like omg!!!  Nope, this weed is just bangin"
"A lot of the time fans forget about the business side of acquisitions. Russell Westbrook puts people in the seats in OKC. If they just give away Russ for nothing, who the hell are fans coming out to see? If Russ didn’t explicitly say he wants out no matter what, they don’t have to just give him away."
Russell Westbrook for Gordan Hayward straight up. Who says no?
Russell Westbrook (for now)  Why am I crying in the club rn?
"This trade can't be completed until December 15, 2019.   **Thunder Get:**   Evan Fournier (ORL), Tyler Johnson (PHX), Mikal Bridges (PHX), Bucks 2020 1st (PHX), 76ers 2021 1st (PHX), Pistons 2020 2nd (PHX)   **Suns Get:**   Russell Westbrook   **Magic Get:**   Ricky Rubio   **The Thunder:** They have decided their championship window is officially closed, and that a player of Russell Westbrook's caliber isn't needed anymore. In this trade they get a promising wing player (Their 17th in the past 3 years), a solid guard in Fournier, and an expiring contract in Tyler Johnson. On top of this, they get some draft pics to sweeten the pot   **The Suns:** They are the kings of knee-jerk moves. Come December, they realize that Rubio just isn't their guy. Westbrook is a legitimate start to put next to Booker.   **The Magic:** Fournier is a solid player, but Markelle Fultz is a big question mark and DJ Augustin isn't a starting caliber PG (Minus game 1 against the Raptors). Rubio could be the PG they have been searching for."
Many people are saying that Russell Westbrook will b traded
"OKC receives: Evan Fournier, Markelle Fultz &amp; Mo Bamba  Orlando receives: Russell Westbrook &amp; Terrance Ferguson + 2nd round pick  Reasoning - Orlando want to make a push through the playoffs as indicated by paying Vucevic, Ross and Aminu, but the team just doesn’t have enough talent to make it last the first round. Adding Westbrook will give them enough to make that push past the first round in the east(insert OKC first round exit joke here) whilst giving up pieces that just wont make a difference come playoff time and two young players with massive injury concerns already and I just don’t really see a lineup of Bamba and vucevic working in today’s league especially when you have Gordon and Issac to play small ball.  OKC gets back shorter contracts and 2 potentially talented players if they can stay/ get healthy."
"I still love the idea of Russell Westbrook straight up for CP3. Houston gets an upgrade at point guard and no longer has to deal with Harden/CP3 clashing, while OKC does not have to pay Russell Westbrook 47 Mil in 2022 (He is 100% opting into that player option). OKC won't be relevant any time soon, might as well wait it out. OKC will be able to clear its cap right in time for all those LAC/MIA picks"
"Oh stop it, you know you want nothing more than to see Pat Riley, The Godfather, have hand in the play of Russell Westbrook. It’s a match made in heaven."
"NYK: Dennis Smith Jr &amp; Mitchell Robinson  OKC: Russell Westbrook, 2020 1st round &amp; Lots of Cash"
"&gt;Heat receive: Russell Westbrook, TJ Warren, Doug McDermott  The Heat land Russ, pick up an upside wing in Warren and grab McDermott who hopefully would find some shooting consistency on a roster that will desperately need shooters.  &gt;Pacers receive: Goran Dragic  A proven point guard on a good contract to replace the retired Collison and keep the Pacers in contention in the east without having to move Oladipo, Turner or Brogdon.  &gt;Thunder receive: Justise Winslow, Dion Waiters, Kelly Olynyk, Miami Round 2 pick 2022 (via Philadelphia)  Miami Round 1 pick 2025, Indiana Round 2 pick 2021 (via Utah),  Indiana Round 2 pick (via Milwaukee)  A prospect in Winslow who is an interesting fit alongside SGA, a couple of bad contracts in Waiters and Olynyk, and more picks. Given the market for Russ right now, I think this is pretty fair compensation and the contracts fit pretty well with the Thunder rebuild timeline."
"Oklahoma City gets: Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson, Langston Galloway, Luke Kennard, 2020 1st rounder, 2022 1st rounder  Detroit gets: Russell Westbrook, Patrick Patterson, Steven Adams  **Why would Detroit do this deal?**  The Eastern Conference is wide open aside from maybe Philadelphia (and even then, I don't like their depth situation). Putting Russell Westbrook alongside Blake Griffin and Steven Adams instantly makes Detroit an Eastern Conference contender. At the very least, they won't have to try and treadmill away.  **Why would Oklahoma City do this deal?**  Sam Presti seems to want draft picks. This gives him two extra 20s-ish first rounders to play with, increasing his already ungodly pick haul. In addition to this, Andre Drummond and Adams are the same age for the most part, and Drummond is an definite upgrade with youth to boot. Reggie Jackson is on an expiring contract which means that OKC can get out of the dreaded luxury tax a lot quicker to boot."
Russell Westbrook MINNESOTA Timberwolves

OKC gets out of Westbrook's massive contract with 3 first round pics and most of the salary shed after 2 years. Rebuild mode for sure.  Miami gets a pretty good center to pair with Jimmy Butler.   http://tradenba.com/trades/BJ7f2H4bS  Can someone tell me why it says the Stiepen Rule is applicable here, I made sure NOT to trade consecutive 1st rounder years."
"Robert Covington and  5 extra wins isn’t worth helping Miami acquire a superstar player. We want Russell Westbrook that’s the problem. It would be different if we had no interest in acquiring him. Russell Westbrook would likely make us a 50 win team, sell more merchandise, and his superstar status would fill Little Ceaser’s Arena every home game.  We’re not helping Miami land a superstar player that we want. I can guarantee you the Pistons won’t be involved in a Westbrook trade unless he’s coming to Detroit."

But those choices weren't hard to make. His drafting as a whole has been ATROCIOUS. He's had like two good drafts in twelve years where he's actually hit on later picks (2008 and 2013). He hasn't one good draft in 6 years. He can't even find solid rotational players. The majority of his picks end up out of the league."

"Theoretically. That's why the 2nd veteran supermax (the 35% one) is sometimes called the ""Durant Rule"" supermax as opposed to the Rose Rule nonveteran max, because they thought one of the reasons Kevin Durant went from OKC to GSW was both teams were able to offer the exact same max contract. So they put in this new veteran designated player supermax to try to keep players with their original teams.  I think it has overall backfired though. You have players like Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard who both declined the supermax and forced their way out of the Pelicans and Spurs. These top 5 players would rather form superteams in big markets like LA and make up for the lost money with endorsements.  Then you have smaller market teams who do give the supermax, like Washington with John Wall, except he isn't a top 5 player, and now that contract is so big it hamstrings their entire cap situation. Even Russell Westbrook is considered one such player since OKC may well trade him just to rid themselves of his huge supermax contract.  As a result, some teams have chosen to not offer the supermax to their own players because they are scared of being saddled with such a big contract. That's what happend with Kemba Walker this summer, with the Hornets lowballing him and essentially forcing him to walk.

"Kind of long to make specific trades but teams I feel should look into Russ: Pistons Heat Pacers Bulls Bucks Magic       I think Pistons should really jump into a possible deal. With Blake there you ust can't be complacent. If you can somehow not give up much and keep Kennard and the rookie in this draft, then I feel Pistons can be good with Russell and Blake. I just think the teams listed should take a shot with Russ. The new lottery odds encourage more risk to win and Russell Westbrook in general is a great player.

Minnesota doesn't have a strong chance to get a WB caliber player otherwise.  OKC gets a chance on a revival project in Andrew Wiggins, and at worst he will be a fantastic tank commander as OKC resets. Jeff Teague is on an expiring contract and could be traded near the deadline for a low level asset. The 2020 pick should be in the 10-20 range as Minnesota would be in contention for a lower seed in the West playoffs. The 2022 pick is uncertain - Towns will be in his prime but WB might have fallen off. Depends on how they build around Towns but the pick definitely has some Top 8 upside."

Like overrated by more fans than any other player? Probably Russell Westbrook.
"Russell Westbrook is not a winning ball player.  That contract is a year and an injury away from entering the John wall zone. Masai has also been pining to control the rebuild since he got to Toronto. It was delayed initially for Lowry and derozan, then it got delayed for the kawhi opportunity, brilliantly.  But now he gets everything on his terms.  Starting out capped out with a defined ceiling, as you say, is unlikely to ever be his first choice moving forward.  Plus, ya know, not for nothing but Siakam takes another leap with his shooting and he is unquestionably better than Westbrook, and legitimately starting to threaten the back end of that top 10 in the NBA.  He should be absolutely untouchable in terms of trades rn."
Yeah. Its Russell Westbrook.
"The biggest loser in all of this: Russell Westbrook. Consistency of stars not wanting to play with him, and now even his franchise is open to moving on. They will absolutely trade him this year to begin their rebuild. They can’t continue to try and pursue a championship with him. Time to blow the whole thing up."
"Russell Westbrook is an 11 year pro, the wrong side of 30 and multiple surgeries.  He is one of the most single minded, my-way-or-the-highway players in the NBA.  At no point in his entire career has he demonstrated any willingness to change his style of play for the betterment of the team--to become a better spot up shooter, to become more of a team first facilitator. It took him ages to decide to play sound defense, and he really obly demonstrated that the last season or two.  Why should anyone have the expectation that Russ would do anything other than what benefits Russ on the court at this point?  Obviously Paul george didnt believe it was possible."
"https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1147386677079564288  &gt;Rival NBA teams have been aware of the discontent of OKC's two stars: Paul George -- and Russell Westbrook, league sources tell @TheAthleticNBA @Stadium. Leonard pushed the Clippers in recent days to deliver him a second star, and they did."
russell westbrook is an all star and all nba caliber player
And we just signed Quinn Cook. Did y'all read about OKC tried to trade PG or Russell Westbrook to y'all? Crazy.
you on ya one nephew...  idgaf where russell westbrook goes lool
Bro you guys had James harden Kevin durant and Russell Westbrook and still couldn’t win a chip hold this L my man
Thunder: Paul George and Russell Westbrook 🙃
"Tear down and rebuild from the draft. Small market teams have a smaller window and have to do a lot more of rebuilding.  OKC had their window when they had Kevin Durant, James Harden, Serge Ibaka, and Russell Westbrook from 09-12, and they made the finals in 2012."
I may be a Knick fan but at least I’m not Russell Westbrook
"So instead, Presti will have an Anthony Davis situation with Russell Westbrook"
"That was just 2018, today is Russell Westbrook day"
"Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall are all still on the same team that drafted them  Marc Gasol and Mike Conley didn't request trades, they just were kind of out of their prime and their team wanted assets instead to rebuild  Demar Derozan was traded against his will  There are plenty of examples of loyalty still"
Fuck no I don't want Russell Westbrook on my team
Jimmy Butler and Russell Westbrook on the same team would be...intetesting to say the least
"no reason to run it back, no team will ever win anything with Russell Westbrook on the roster"
*Russell Westbrook wants to know your location*
"I wholeheartedly disagree with this mindset. You can't run a business/organization based on emotion. If the right move for the Thunder is to move on from Russ (not saying it is or isn't), than they need to do it. Not saying his legacy and loyalty aren't commendable, they absolutely are, but the Thunder need to do what is best for the Thunder moving forward, not what is best for Russell Westbrook."
Watch the Lakers make a trade for Russell Westbrook within the next few days. Since everybody wants to return to their hometown team...
"Here's the part from that article:  &gt;Presti pursued a package of Russell Westbrook and George to the Raptors -- with the NBA's Most Improved Player, forward Pascal Siakam, as the centerpiece of a broader, asset-crippling deal -- but Ujiri couldn't keep up with the Clippers' willingness to unload unprotected first-round picks into the middle of the next decade, league sources said. Simply, Toronto didn't have the depth of picks it needed to get a deal done -- nor the certainty that getting George would make Leonard stay with the Raptors, sources said.  &gt;The Raptors could have been looking at adding Westbrook, with four years, $171 million left on his deal, and George to a roster that Leonard still might have fled. Toronto extended itself as far as it could for Leonard, but Ujiri could never be sure that the Thunder even wanted to do a deal with them -- and perhaps were just using the Raptors to squeeze more out of the Clippers."
"In a way I agree with you. I think that’d be one of the best poetic endings for a Thunder franchise player, but as a fan of Russell Westbrook I don’t want to see us waste his prime years here. If we’re not going to commit using these picks to build around him then he deserves to go to a team that is contending. Get him that ring.      As a Thunder fan I absolutely agree. He is OKC basketball. He’s virtually intertwined with the culture here. I would love for him to stay here until the very end. But only if we’re going to treat him right. Get him the ring or get him to a team that will."
"The Magic may be more in limbo than most rebuilding teams because they're a small market, but re-signing one of the better centers in basketball at 28 is much different than committing ~43 million to a 30+ Russell Westbrook who can't lead a team to an away game victory in the playoffs.   And that's what it comes down to that I don't think you're getting.   Westbrook isn't a positive value in any capacity. His biggest asset is his loyalty to the Thunder and that he's a good dude.   The Mavs have a timeline that's perfect with Luka and Kristaps. They're not fucking that up with Westbrook lol.   I mean Jimmy is a weird dude so maybe? I think Pat Riley is smarter than that, though."
"Clippers are completely screwed after 3-4 years with sending more an absurd number of first round picks.   Best player they have is Patrick beverley, a post labrum tear surgery Paul george, and kawhi, and a weak overall lineup.   Lakers could easily take out the clippers in the playoffs.  OKC needs to get some talent with all their picks if they want to have a shot at winning with Russell Westbrook.   Lakers need to use their available cap space and go get some point guard"

Id rather trade Ben Simmons for Dewayne Dedmond than Russell Westbrook.
Instead of making a new thread I'll post in here:  I did trade finder with updated rosters for Westbrook on 2K not expecting anything in return. One offer came up and although it looks crazy at first when you think about it could make some sense:  **Russell Westbrook and Nerlens Noel for Chris Paul and Eric Gordon**  If the Thunder want to tank this wouldn't be a bad idea.
"Russell Westbrook everyone..,"
D'Angelo Russell for Westbrook straight up once Klay is back lol. Anything is possible - KG
"      I want to preface this by saying Paul WAS NOT disgruntled Russell. Shortly after his trade was annouced, PG [tweeted this](https://mobile.twitter.com/Yg_Trece/status/1147417137180319744) out which shows he has no ill will towards Westbrook.        Paul was disgruntled with the Thunder org. The news about Paul being unhappy was first reported by Shams (a respected reporter; he and Woj were the only ones who correctly reported that Kawhi was signing with the Clippers before he officially announced his decision) in [this tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1147386677079564288). He was unhappy due to the repeated first round exits in the playoffs as well as the lack of improvement with the team roster."

"kind of hard not to be optimistic about the team that has the number 2 and number 5 player in the league. The clippers have the number one and I would arguably say Paul George is a top-10 player, although he was playing like one of the best if not the best players earlier this year when it look like a Russell Westbrook handed the reins over to the franchise to him."

Hope he gets to a team he can contribute on and win a ring, I really really do, he deserves it so much, I’m boutta cry bros"
"I'm a newish fan of the NBA and my team, since I've started watching the last 2 years, has been the Pelicans. So, I get being a fan of a small market team. And, please, dont grill me too hard if I'm mistaken. I'd like to learn from it if I am. But, didn't the Supersonics/Thunder draft KD, Russ, and Harden? In back-to-back-to back years? Imagining the three of them on the same team now, you would think that's a guaranteed championship. Two of them have chosen not to stay and gone to be the best player on their respective teams? Title co tenders and title winners. 2 of the 10 best players in the league. Yet Russell still remains? Maybe it wasnt the small market. Maybe it was Westbrook? Maybe the management? AD gave the previous Pels management every chance and they couldn't deliver. I have no beef with him leaving. Maybe Paul just realized that there was no real future with this franchise and with Russ. I mean, he could've left earlier, but decided to stay. That doesn't strike me as a guy who thinks himself above the peasent small markets and decides to shamelessly chase rings."

Idk if this is true or not but I can report that Russell Westbrook follows One Direction on Twitter
"11 PM, Los Angeles. Russell Westbrook is putting up shots in the gym in a late-night training session, gearing up for next season. He clanks a pull-up three slightly to the right of the rim, swears quietly under his breath, then walks towards the bench for some Gatorade.   Jerami Grant and Terrance Ferguson have been there for the last three minutes - their stamina isn't quite as good as Russ's. They're whispering quietly to each other. Russ walks over: ""Hey, what's going on? We gonna get back to it soon?""  Russ looks at Terrance, who is pale in the face.  ""Whoa, you okay? Should I call the staff?""  The younger guard blinks twice, and slowly shakes his head. He can't find the words he wants to say.  ""PG. Sam traded PG.""  It's Jerami, who looks similarly stunned. But he knows his leader needs to hear the news from a friend, not from a Twitter feed.  ""You're kidding right?"" laughs Russ. ""We just went fishing last Friday.""  ""Sam traded PG to the Clippers, Russ. He's not getting back on the plane.""  Russ shakes his head. He can't believe it. He furiously searches up Presti's number in his phone, but it hits his voicemail. Sweating, he decides to call PG instead. The phone rings three times. Click.  ""Russ, hey. Listen-""  ""What happened, man? When did it happen? Whose decision was it?""  A long pause. Maybe six seconds, but to Russ it feels like an eternity. And then a chuckle on the other end of the phone.  ""Next question."""
You don't want James Butler and Russell Westbrook in the same locker room my man
"For what it's worth, the Tweet sounded like Paul George and Russ were both frustrated at the Thunder organization, not with each other necessarily.

Russell Westbrook
The myth of Russell Westbrook Triple Double God has overtaken the reality that he's a very good player with some weaknesses. Not every player is Kevin Durant or LeBron James.
"I agree but through a slightly different lens.  I've long harbored the suspicion that Lebron James' fatal flaw is the 28/7/7 stat line and he should really be shooting for more like 33/12^reb/4^ast type of player.  In the same way, we should be calling Russell Westbrook ""Mr. Hindsight"" because he should always be 20/20^ast if he wants his team to go all the way."
"Actually the numbers I posted are era adjusted.  I'm not saying he's overrated and not still great but just overrated.  And that may be a more personal thing, but I don't think it is, bc I always thought of him as a top 3 player in the league during his prime and he really wasn't.  He was like top 10-15 and overall top 50 rather than top 25 or something like that.  But that's where some context comes into play.  I'm working on a teammate analysis now and we all intuitively know that he never had any great ones especially on the offensive side of the ball.  Some of his inefficiency was based on the style that reigned in the NBA and just how much of the offensive output he had to manage in order for them to win.  Very few players had to carry more than Iverson.    I still love him overall but inefficiency is a fair criticism.  However he is still more efficient than Russell Westbrook, and Andrew Wiggins."
Damn U Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook is a professional basketball player who makes bank and is great in many ways but is also flawed, which is common.  Are people not able to comprehend that, where we have to make up an analogy? An analogy really isn't needed unless you can't understand, I think we do."
"I've said this once, twice, and damn near a thousand times at this point. Russell Westbrook is a slightly better version of Monta Ellis. Monta always tried to play hero in the 4th and turn the ball over more often then not trying to chuck up some wild shot everyone knows he'll miss but every once in a blue moon he sinks it so he justifies himself doing it 100 more times. And the fans love it because when he does sink it it's a thrilling moment to tie or win the game and they remember that shit more then all the turnovers that got them into a hole that the team was forced to climb out of to begin with."
"“Don't talk like one of them. You're not! Even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.”  - LeBron James to Russell Westbrook after Westbrook blamed LeBron for KD joining GSW, circa 2017"
Russell Westbrook is the guy who carried his team to the playoffs 3 straight years in the West when lebron and his goofy toon squad couldn’t even do it.

This article has the clip. Not as wide open and straightforward a shot as implied.  https://deadspin.com/the-blazers-really-want-russell-westbrook-to-keep-shoot-1834216198
"I think the idea that a coach needs to ""get a player in line"" is patently absurd.  Russell Westbrook is a 30 year old man who plays on a team that has appointed a coach to give him instructions about how to play the game of basketball within the context of a team system.  If Westbrook is unwilling to follow those instructions, I find it absolutely bonkers that the coach is the one being blamed for it.  This isn't a rookie coach, it's a guy who's led a team to a national title.    Going even farther than that, if someone wants to criticize Donovan on his X's and O's, fine.  But coaches bear FAR too much responsibility in ""controlling"" their players.  They're not 16.  They're not young guys just seeing the world for the first time in college.  These are adults.  If they don't have the discipline to follow coaching, then that's on them, not the coach."
"This. Sooo this. It doesn't matter how well or badly Dame plays, he never makes it about himself or talks shit, it's all about the team. I truly believe the biggest reason a Russell Westbrook team will never be successful is his personality"
Russell Westbrook doesn’t belong on an NBA roster. Pointing that out doesn’t make me a hater.
after russell westbrook i started reading this as russell wilson for some reason haha
Someone should make a High Quality GIF of The Office scene where they argue about whether Hilary Swank is hot except it should be about whether Russell Westbrook is a MVP caliber basketball player.
"Hey, not all of us Lakers fans are ""toxic and delusional"" lol. I hope the OP is just trolling and doesn't seriously think that Lonzo Ball is better than Russell Westbrook right now  Also, I just checked the OP's post history, and it seems like he was a Cleveland Cavaliers fan before LeBron James signed with the Lakers. It looks like the OP has been a LeBron James fan before being a Lakers fan (there's nothing wrong with that), I just wanted to point that out since I found that pretty interesting lol"
List of facts:  • Russell Westbrook is a great basketball player  • Triple-doubles are among the dumbest metric in sports and don't mean anything. A player getting 10/10/10 shouldn't have any value over a player getting 42/17/9
Yes Im sure Russell Westbrook wouldve swept the KAJ/Magic/Worthy Lakers and the Bird/McHale/Parish Celtics. Why not I guess.
Russell Westbrook looks like Ducky from Land Before Time.
russell westbrook: next question.      the media: *i'm about to end this man's whole career*
"Alright this shit's ridiculous now. Russell Westbrook has nothing to do with this post, and still you find a way to shit on him with an opposing player's performance. Shit makes no sense the why people try to rope him in for every part of OKC's struggles"
"Bro OKC has a BELOW AVERAGE OFFENSE in the era of pace and space, put them in 1994 along with their rules and they wouldnt be scoring 90 ppg.  Superstar player Russell Westbrook has a career playoff TS of 51%. It’d be very fun to see how much worse he’d do without any spacing whatsoever against the best defensive player of all time."
"    Russell Westbrook thread counter:      78,213,567th Westbrook thread today"
Russell Westbrook probably talks down to waiters also.
"Kobe Bryant: “When I turn on the TV and I watch players play, the player that plays with the same kind of emotion and grit and competitive intensity is Russell [Westbrook],” Bryant said of the All-Star guard. “Russell is going hard. Doesn’t matter who he is playing against, doesn’t matter what the odds are, he’s going, that’s a guy, he is going 110 percent every single time.”"
“Sounds good to me” -Russell “Literally YMCA scrub” Westbrook
"And because of the constant negativity given to anyone who likes Westbrook I'm guessing at this point you're not even entering most of the threads, right?   That's what's happening to anyone who likes Russell Westbrook right now so only the users who dislike westbrook are active in the discussion right now so it makes it seem like the whole of /r/nba hates westbrook when in truth the users who do just aren't participating in the discussion. When the playoffs end I guarantee we'll see a lot less negativity about him and it's not that users are constantly flip-flopping their opinions but rather we'll be seeing a different set of users participating."
"Point guards I’d take before Westbrook: curry, Irving, lillard, Conley, Lowry, holiday, Simmons, Russell"
"alright hot takes aside, Russell Westbrook is not a ""severely overrated basketball player."" he's a top 5 PG in the league."
KD is that great that he managed to get to the finals playing against tough western teams and against Russell Westbrook.
Are you trying to claim that Russell Westbrook is a better passer than LeBron James?
Russell Westbrook acts like the only person that ever get asked stupid questions or get negative articles written about him
"Russell ""Rebound Hunting"" Westbrook"
"Am I the only one who thinks KD is actually wrong about this? Like don't get me wrong he definitely does generate a lot of buzz, but if hypothetically Kevin Durant didn't exist, the media would just focus on the next great player or just shit on Russell Westbrook more. It's like any celebrity who thinks that Hollywood can't move on without them."
"Normally I'd agree with you but The Athletic consistently puts out really really good content. I'd say out of anything out there, hands down the best content comes from The Athletic. There's a reason a lot of the big time journalist have been moving there.     But since we all hate pay walls.. here you go:           LOS​ ANGELES​ —​ After​ the Warriors bested the​ Clippers 113-105 in​ Sunday’s Game 4 to​ take​ a 3-1 series​​ lead, Steve Kerr joked about handling future press conferences with “next question,” a la Russell Westbrook. Then he got serious. On Westbrook’s approach, Kerr summarized, “I think it’s dangerous for the league.”  “Next question” is already a favored joke catchphrase around the NBA, with players and coaches winking at Westbrook’s curt handling of The Daily Oklahoman’s Berry Tramel. Just before Game 4, Clippers Doc Rivers joked, “I could say ‘next question,’ but I’m not going to do that,” in response to a reporter’s query.  Westbrook, whose loud play and wardrobe so often command attention, made waves after a Game 3 victory over the Blazers on Friday with tactical silence. After Westbrook used, “next question” on Tramel and stalled, the next reporter asked Paul George about his exclamation dunk at the end of the game. “Next question,” George replied.   “It’s spreading,” captioned The Oklahoman beat writer Maddie Lee when she [tweeted video of the non-exchange](https://twitter.com/maddie_m_lee/status/1119465196521697280). Reporters and fans called for the league to do something about this, but it is unclear what rules were violated. Westbrook had shown up to the press conference. He wasn’t cursing. He had fulfilled his duties by the letter while spitting on their spirit.  “I just feel that we have to be very careful as a league,” Kerr, a former TNT broadcaster, said of Westbrook’s approach and its potential spread. “We’re in a good place right now. Very popular. Fans love the game, the social dynamic, the fashion. But more than anything they love the connection they feel to the players. I think it’s important for the players to understand that it’s a key dynamic to this league. I don’t think this is a healthy dynamic, for this league, for any player, any team, any local media, any national media.”  In Kerr’s view, no communication is different in kind from simply uninspired answers.  “It’s all part of the business,” Kerr said. “You’ve got to feed information to the fans. You don’t have to give a great answer, but it’s dangerous when you go down that path of no communication because one of the reasons people like the league right now is we have a lot of great players, really good guys who handle themselves well. So don’t kill that. You’ve got to keep that going. That’s a big part of the business.”  Kerr doesn’t believe this player-vs.-media tension is a new dynamic necessarily, but does believe that access is more important than it’s been in the past.  “There’s always been this stuff. There’s always been players and media members having issues and maybe non-responses, whatever,” he said. “I don’t think this is brand new, but we’re in an era where there’s 24/7 access, and that access is what’s driven revenue so much and players need to remember that.”  On whether the Thunder should do something about the Westbrook-Tramel situation, Kerr responded, “That’s not for me to say.” The temptation might have been there, but Kerr restrained himself from replying, “Next question.”"
I guess every reporter is out here writing Russell Westbrook hit pieces
"He's Russell Westbrook, you know who he is."
Russell “Wilt Hunting” Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook is the classic sore loser.  Dude is all nice and chatty with fellow players when his team wins.  Dude walks off the court and tells reporters to fuck off when his team loses.  Seriously, he needs to grow up.  Lots of great players are competitive. Sure, they get mad when they lose but he doesn't need to bring it to other people."
"&gt; Yes, Russ has been bad during the playoffs and deserves any fair criticism that comes his way. But the ridiculous narrative that he has always been an awful player and there are 15 other guys you would rather have on your team has got to stop.  There are definitely over 10 players I’d pick over him.  &gt; Russell Westbrook is OKC. He has spent his whole career there, and hopefully will retire there. When KD left, he could have seen in such a small market where things were going and bolted, but he didnt. He showed loyalty to the city that had given him their hearts, and he signed a 4 year extension.  Completely irrelevant.  &gt; It's not too often that a franchise, especially a small market franchise, gets a player like Westbrook. He is the kind of player that EVERY franchise hopes to get. Someone with superstar skill, but also the loyalty to stick with the team through good and bad. Russell Westbrook is OKC and we will ride or die with him till the end. Trash him all you want, but in the end, you most likely wish you had him on your team.  Completely irrelevant.  Also, he’s lucky to play in Oklahoma because if he played in New York/Boston/Philly he’d get booed out of the arena."
You have an entire account dedicated to hating Russell Westbrook? Respect.
russell westbrook
"Yeah I’ve noticed the same thing. Back when I played, you weren’t allowed to stick three fingers in the air when you made a three, or flex when you got an and-one, or any of that stuff. Now it seems every team does those things, and I think the NBA has heavily influenced that. While I think the NBA inspires kids to have fun and enjoy every moment, some players are bad influences on young kids. Russell Westbrook and his “next question” garbage. Kawhi and AD showing it’s okay to quit on your team. I hope those types of things don’t trickle down to lower levels and influence a negative culture shift"
"Well, I'm afraid you don't know the whole story.  https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/10/22/nba-media-roundtable-russell-westbrook-lebron-james-interview-protest  Westbrook was regarded as a prickly interviewee before the Barry Trammel stuff ever happened.  He has consistently been unprofessional with various members of the media, who, frankly, are just doing their jobs.  As far as his reaction to Trammel, do you think WB is the first player to ever be asked a question that may sow discord in the locker room?  Of course not.  But, as far as I know, he is the first player to throw a public months/year long tantrum about a particular reporter.  I'm not a WB hater, I don't think I've ever said anything negative about him, but his approach to the media is just a bad look."
"Russell ""Will Hunting"" Westbrook"
"the disrespect to Russell Westbrook day.  Well, They also fall on the same day sometimes."
sharpe: russell westbrook is that good-looking
He can credit him all he wants. It's been proven that players get better when they leave OKC. The Ringer wrote an article on it. Pretty decent ready actually. [The Westbrook Effect](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/13/16770062/victor-oladipo-russell-westbrook-okc-effect)
Russell Westbrook is like a pizza with pineapple on it
"""Russell Westbrook is like that guy you love to go to Vegas with, but who is horrible in every other setting because of the alcoholism.""  ""Russell Westbrook is like the eccentric genius who can solve unsolvable math problems on the blackboard, but has to work as a janitor because of his uncontrollable temper.""  ""Russell Westbrook is like a circus bear who is amazing on a unicycle, but sometimes kills and eats people."""
"Let’s just look at the reality of this situation. Every since KD left, Russell have performed poorly in the playoffs. He hasn’t even made it out of the first round. Russell Westbrook is so overrated and so inefficient.They need to trade him and rebuild around PG."
" ""Russell Westbrook is that good-looking girl that we overlook all the other flaws — she has a terrible personality, she's not really nice to people and she has a bad attitude. What Russ has seduced us with is the triple-double ... we forget how poorly he shot the ball."" — Shannon Sharpe"
"Ignoring questions being asked by specific reporters for years because they criticized your basketball play in the past is objectively worse than leaving an interview early because nobody is asking you questions...  Paul ""got a pass"" because what he did is of less magnitude, and he doesn't have the same history of Russell Westbrook in the ""professionalism towards the media"" aspect. Stop trying to equate dissimilar things."
"Coach Nick From Bball Breakdown has always stated that Russell Westbrook was overrated AF. Look at some of his videos on WB.  His variance... Like they said, you live or die with the brodie.  I always thought Russell Westbrook was a top 5 PG but seeing him lately just makes me want to change my mind.  Often times I feel like he's statpadding rather than trying to win. His shooting has taken a significant dip for some reason this season and his form looks bad. He literally just throws it up with his arms and hopes for the best.  I mean I don’t mind him hogging the ball if he’s gonna take a high percentage shot but damn his decision making has never gotten any better.   This probably won’t happen and idk if Westbrook has a no trade clause, but I personally would consider making a trade for Anthony Davis with Westbrook added in the package, similar to what the Raptors did in the Kawhi-Derozan trade. That way Schroder, Roberson, George, Grant, Davis. I don’t think OKC will do this they definitely need a major revamp. As I don't see how a team can win a title with Westbrook as their best player.  Unpopular opinion maybe, but I feel like Russell Westbrook is like the point guard version of Carmelo Anthony. Merely puts on empty stats but doesn't truly help much in terms of winning."

"Look man all I'm saying is that if you thought OKC's playoffs performance in the post-KD era was because of bad luck, Melo or whatever, you're ignoring the reality of their situation.  The last team to win a ring with a player leading the league in assists was the showtime Lakers. The last team to win the league without a decent amount of three point shooting was the Pistons    I know we get caught up in regular season hype and big box scores but OKC's problem is systemic. You CANNOT be a contender if Russell Westbrook is your central player. There is zero precedent for a non-shooting, ball-dominant point guard leading a team to success in the modern era"
Bill Simmons said that your opinion on Russell Westbrook reveals your level of understanding of basketball. Truest thing he's ever said lol
Westbrook trade idea:   r/nba receives: Russell Westbrook  NBA receives: Countless of posts of trade ideas for Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook will bounce back from his poor shooting year and solidify himself as a top 10 player in the NBA
Jimmy butler and Russell Westbrook just wanted to be in the same city so they could carpool to Paris fashion week together
"**WEST**  1. LAC  2. DEN  3. UTAH  4. POR  5. LAL  6. HOU  7. GSW  8. NOP   The Clippers at the time of writing are the best team in the NBA on paper. They have three of the top defensive players in the league in their starting five as well as incredible scorers in Leonard, PG and Lou Will.   Denver and Utah have the most depth and the best systems to fit their playing style, with great balance and defenders in their systems. They can both have great regular and postseasons.   Portland lost a lot of depth for Whiteside, but his shot blocking ability was something Portland lacked for a good portion of last season.   The Lakers have depth they can build around for AD and LeBron, however, LeBron's health and longevity is a question as he nears 35 years of age, and this would be the first LeBron-led team without a star guard who can score at will by his side during his championship-contending career.   The Rockets will still be lethal from three, but depth, coaching, and teammate trust (whatever that CP3 situation was) could impact them in the playoffs (yes, I'm saying D'Antoni's coaching is atrocious in the postseason, watch 2018 WCF and you'll understand what I mean).   Even with the acquisition of Russell, I think Golden State will have a hard road to the postseason, despite Curry having an MVP-caliber season. Depth has been depleted after moving on from Iguodala and Livingston and Klay will take time to find his rhythm late in the season. I also predict that Russell will be traded for depth at the deadline.   New Orleans has done a wonderful job on a quick rebuilding turnaround after trading Anthony Davis and surrounding Zion with young players to build a solid core. I think they have a better shot at the postseason than the Kings and Spurs have.   **EAST**  1. MKE  2. IND  3. MIA (assuming Westbrook is traded there)  4. BKN  5. PHL  6. BOS  7. TOR  8. ORL   Milwaukee will rule the east for the first half of the decade with Giannis, Middleton and Lopez, and they can be even better than last year (and win more games) since most of their roster will return for the 2020 season. While I believe they will own the league's best win loss record at 63-19, they will not be as well equipped to face the defensive monster that is the Los Angeles Clippers in a Finals matchup.   Indiana is my dark horse to win the title out of the East. They have excellent depth, Oladipo will return, and without him, they got Indiana a top 5 seed in the conference last season. They can beat any team in the NBA if healthy.   Miami is poised to have a major season in my mind (if they can figure out the cap situation to fit Westbrook in a trade package). Butler and Westbrook can feed off of each other and lead them into a deep regular season, however, I don't see them going far in the playoffs if Westbrook performs the same way he has in the last three postseasons since Durant left OKC.   Brooklyn will thrive this next year with Kyrie Irving running the offense. Charis LeVert's ceiling is still very high and he can be a big contributor on both sides of the floor. Allen's defense will improve and the depth after the Russell sign and trade before they lost him for nothing in free agency was a genius move by GM Sean Marks.   I'm not a stone believer in the Sixers coming into the 19-20' season, mainly because of Embiid's health issues, but also because I need to see that Harris can be the centerpiece of the Sixers offense.   After what I consider to have been a disaster of a season last year, as well as losing Kyrie and Horword, they have Kemba and some youth, but I don't see a deep postseason run in Boston this year. Kemba as well will have to grow as a leader to restore the chemistry issues left behind last year.   Toronto has the pieces to stay in the postseason with Gasol and Siakam, but it will be tough after losing Leonard and Green in the offseason.   Orlando doesn't have much of a ceiling here, unless they can trade for a true star player while keeping Gordon (who's health is a question), but I could definitely see them making the postseason again this year.  **BEST RECORD** MILWAUKEE BUCKS 63-19 **WORST RECORD** 12-70 CHARLOTTE HORNETS"
"Well sure, but that doesn’t mean you rush to trade away the franchise icon at the first offer thrown your way. It’s essentially being suggested that they should just trade Russ for Winslow straight up with Dragic thrown in as filler. Winslow for Russ is not enough. And sending Russ to Miami also hurts the value of at least the first Miami pick they acquired in the PG trade. Presti is going to take his time and make sure he gets something of value for Westbrook. I like Winslow, but he’s not enough for Russell Westbrook"
"Yeah let’s wait until 2021 when jimmy B is out of his prime and we could get anyone in free agency, maybe even someone like Russell Westbrook"

"4 of those fucking guys didn’t even make the playoffs LOL, you think they deserve to be listed above Westbrook who averaged a triple double and made the playoffs in a tough conference? Devin Booker has no business being listed with those guys, he needs to prove he’s a winning player and not just putting up high numbers on a 19 win team every year.   And please tell me how Kemba Walker is a better player than Russell Westbrook? Walker is a better three point shooter but he still shot 43% from the field while Westbrook shot 42% and shot under 30% from three while Walker was close to 36%."

"Out of all the shit comments I’ve read this is by far the worst constructed and weakest argument it’s actually hilarious.   First, do you really think I give a fuck about Karma? I’ve got way too much going on in my life to care being honest. Do other people actually do this? I thought attention seeking was for Instagram or twitter.  The point of this post was to point out that at this current moment Westbrook is still a top 10 player and imo still a very valuable player. I hope I haven’t lost you yet, it’s pretty simple so try follow along as best you can.  Zach Lowe and Simmons without question are good at what they do, but to take everything they say as gospels shows you can’t even process the game, your opinions of basketball are somebody else’s thoughts.   Let’s get to the his contract situation, obviously it’s a lot of money but most players at his level make astronomical amounts of money, if you want the best it costs more that’s life I’m afraid. For teams with not a lot of cap space and who don’t have many movable options it obviously makes it tougher to trade for Russ. Also have you considered that OKC won’t just let him walk out the door? They’ll try acquire as much  as possible, and at the moment not a lot of teams in the market for a PG have cap space or moveable players. I understand why these teams may second guess this move especially if they’ve got no pieces to put around him.   To be honest I don’t think you even understand my argument, I never claimed to “get it” and I’m not saying Lowe and Simmons do not “get it” or in any way is my basketball knowledge above theirs. I bet if I had the 40+ hours a week to watch basketball and analyze basketball like they do I’d know a lot more but that’s for an other day.   Now finally, Russell Westbrook ain’t paying my bills so to be honest I don’t give a fuck about him. I just get frustrated with people like you, who clearly have no knowledge of basketball and most likely doesn’t have a great knowledge of anything, try talk shit about literally the greatest athlete of all time. It’s the likes of you why so many people abandon this sub reddit, and all is left is the 14 year olds who think LeBron is better than Jordan. Show some respect, watch basketball, read books about the game, watch documentaries about the game, do something because you haven’t a clue mate."
"&gt; also-ran  What?  I don't think it turns us into a contender, but that team puts us in the playoffs, playing meaningful basketball from October through April. Only one team can win a championship, but 16 make the playoffs.   Also, having Russ on the team gives you ""The Guy"" your city can rally behind. That's an important thing to have in a franchise. There's been a LeBron sized crater in Cleveland since he left and we would love to have someone as entertaining day in and day out as Russell Westbrook."
"Fair, but In kd’s case he is widely considered a “snake” bc he took over his free agency destiny rather than waiting to to be used as an asset. Betraying a fan base loyal not to him but to the team and the whims of the GM and Governor. By that same logic Clay Bennett should be considered snake numero Uno for relocating the team to OKC after he went on record saying he would not and changing the name to the Thunder. As well as Sam Presti for trading Harden and recently secretly putting Westbrook on the trading block, Who has been complimented for his “loyalty” in the media and used by Russell himself when signing his deal to now asking  for a trade. Don’t forget Paul George had a day dedicated to him after signing a max with OKC only to demand a trade a year later. Ray Allen, another considered “snake”, losing to Lebron James Heat (in 3-1 fashion I believe) in the playoffs to joining forces with the Heat to win the NBA finals with them the very next year.   These a all example of snake moves but neither do they get as much for as kd. In my view being a “snake” or “loyal” are just useless terms manipulated by the people in charge and by the media as a talking point and to push narratives. It’s a business first and foremost. To Celtics fans Allen is still a snake probably but to Ray the Celtics we’re reducing his minutes and trying to trade him. He did what was best for him.  Yes kd joined a 73 win team that in the end still lost to Lebron. But he maximized his opportunities. We don’t know went behind the scenes until the whole truth comes out as per Durant and Westbrook’s versions of it. Not SAS version.   Kd has nothing to prove besides proving he is still the same player he was before the injury on the court, fan perspective off the court is irrelevant."

"Dude. None of those quotes call out westbrook. Thats not me inventing Bias, thats literally what happened. Find one that does from any of those people please. You are sounding really really obsessive here with how you are trying to manipulate broad quotes into a specific attack on russell.. If Zach had a quote attacking Russ, he wouldve provided it. But he didnt so he used loose quotes about the offense as a whole (which factors in every player and coach not just russ) to target russ.    Why would KD defend Russ on his burner? that wasnt supposed to be Public? Also dipo got traded and Kd/Pg left due to Billy which is literally my point.. you are agreeing with me but are too ignorant to realize it because you are refusing to listen to evidence other than misrepresented quotes lol   Another thing, Dipo credits russ to his success this year? so that was a bad thing to bring up to defend your point.  PG left after 2 playoff series not 1 so again, you do not know what you are talking about. Also russ shot a better 3P% than PG did in this years playoffs IIRC.    Dude you are incredibly misinformed/ignorant to be having this conversation. How can you still not realize how ridiculous it is to think one player gets to decide how the entire offense was ran under multiple coaches and with multiple other star players.. This would have been directly addressed by someone if it was the truth but it obviously isnt. Just stop dude. You are looking so desperate."
"Gotcha, so that would explain why Russell Westbrook has a slightly higher VORP total across his career than Steph Curry, despite Curry being a consensus top 5 player. They average a similar amount of minutes, but Westbrook averages 2 MPG more than Curry over the last 5 years and takes 1-2 more shots per game."
This post was brought to you by the Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry gang
"If I could give you a cool human being award, I would.  It is fun to have a discussion on this sub and not just get trolled.  &gt;Mitchell can have his 40 point games. He can have the high usage rate and ‘thrive’. He can average 24 a game. My point is that he can have all of that, and not be the alpha required for a contender  But my point is that that was where he was last year. As only an NBA sophomore. With a significantly worse roster. The roster itself was not a 'contender' roster. It is this year if you take everyone on the team, remove Mitchell, and slot a superstar (or alpha. I like your word alpha though cuz that implies a little killer instinct) then this is most definitely a contender roster.   And I'm stating that Mitchell is that alpha. If you slot him as a superstar this year, that's why they deserve this hype. Again, everything you quoted was last year (only his second NBA season) with a worse roster. He has a built in bump solely from the roster improvement. I feel like, barring injury to someone, (and if you're gonna disagree and say it isn't banked, why?) just that alone is a banked improvement for him just due to circumstance. What I've been trying to point out is that with the roster improvement if you slot Mitchell in as a superstar this year's roster actually is a contender roster.    &gt;He can also lift a lottery team into relevance, and still not be an alpha for a contender. I am saying your reasons for him being an alpha are points for why he will be good, but not enough to say he’s the alpha on the contender.   This was done as a rookie though. You can tell that the only difference between my assessment and yours is you (for whatever concrete reason you haven't presented) flat do not think he will improve further lol (you call it strong skepticism, and that's fair. I understand you're being open minded, but the point stands that you base your prediction on the idea that he isn't gonna get that much better). And I say that because he's already demonstrated scoring ability at 23.8 ppg.   The efficiency will only go up now that he's got actual help and doesn't have to take 19.9 shots a game where probably 6ish of those were just bad shot selections. If you can drop that to 17 shots per game with significantly fewer bad shots, you can jump to 26ish ppg on better efficiency.   And he can do that through just the roster improvement. They have Ingles, bogie, Royce, and Conley now that were all 39%+ at spot up 3s last year around Mitchell. That's insane. You combine that with gobert who was already an elite rim roller (even with terrible spacing and a crowded paint) and broke the NBA record for dunks last year, and you're talking about an actual night/day situation in regards to the amount of room Mitchell is now going to have to work with (I'm not gonna get off on a tangent here. I'm just adding this to further my point about the whole roster being a contender roster, but the same is true of Conley as well. He's never had as much space as he's going to have this season. Admitted so himself in his intro presser yesterday. And gobert is gonna break his own dunk record for dunks with the extra room to work considering what he just accomplished)  So that's just taking the level he's at and giving him a bump through roster improvement around him.    Now for him just as a player:  &gt;I haven’t been super convinced by his playoff performances. He’s been good and bad. His overburden isn’t his fault, but being an alpha on a champ is so tough.  In your OP you openly praise how great Russell Westbrook's MVP season was, yet you diminish the accomplishment of ending said season.   Mitchell is the ONLY rookie in NBA history to lead his team to a playoff series win while being the team's leading scorer. Only one. And sure. You can blame Ricky rubio (of all fucking ppl lmao) for tilting Russell Westbrook that series and you can blame Joe Ingles for doing the same to Paul George but the fact remains that Mitchell is the lead scorer. That burden was entirely on his shoulders as a rookie and he lived up to it. And he did so against a player with what you call an all time MVP season and Paul George. And Mitchell was an absolutely dominant scorer that series. Performed every bit the level any star player would. There's just no way to not consider that as being an Alpha. Sure, he wasn't an alpha _for a contender_ then, but the roster was worse, and he WAS after all only a rookie. But damn man I feel like it is insane how many ppl undervalue the accomplishment of what he did there. I mean look at:  http://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba-daily-best-ever-playoff-rookies/   And again, he ended the MVP run you portend to be impressed with. You wanna tell me Russell Westbrook and Paul George just weren't good enough? Tired after the regular season?  So when you refer to his disappointing playoff performances, you're referring to against the rockets both of the last two seasons. And that is specifically due to the fact that the roster the jazz had was just hard countered by the rockets. They were just a flat terrible matchup. The entirety of jazz nation let out a groan when we got matched up against them this year. And it isn't because of a lack of talent, it is just a bad match up. That does happen. The jazz would have been infinitely more competitive vs even the warriors. But sometimes the match up is just bad. The jazz do the same thing to the nuggets. Joker was just absolutely God awful and the nuggets lost when they would play the jazz. You can list other examples all across the NBA.   And I'm not going to argue that they were good series cuz they weren't. But the reason why it went so poorly wasn't because Mitchell has a playoff problem, they just ran into their kryptonite twice.   The stats I'm calling for way up there are something he's already done anyway. This year post all star break: 46.1% shooting on 20.4 attempts per game, 45.1 3pt % with 26.7/4.5/4.6 splits. So the ""bump"" I gave him with this overhauled roster is just a permanent elevation to the level he was already performing at. (As in, IF he's got the star cred I'm giving him, that should just about be his _floor_ with all this extra help)  The guy _has been_ an alpha for his team. And the team and he has made that jump to contender now.   Your issue is you don't think he's gonna make another jump because you haven't properly given him the due for what his path as a player is. But again I say to you, if Mitchell performed perfectly identically for a bigger market and had been given the initial hype of being a lottery pick, then what I'm saying wouldn't even be controversial cuz that's what everyone expected.   He still gets treated as if what he's doing is an abberation, and not indicative of his career path. Because if you were to purely rate him on his merits so far vs players who have performed at a similar level and with similar success through 2 seasons, he's absolutely a candidate to make the jump to full fledged superstar in year 3.   To answer your question about current NBA alphas, I would give kawhi, PG, harden, LeBron, KD, giannis, Steph, and Joel embiid (sometimes Russell Westbrook lol, I'm not high on him anymore myself) all that title. No one else"
Russell Westbrook is untradeable.
"Right but if you had a chance to bring in Russell Westbrook and all you had to do was provide matching salary and move down in the draft, not give up firsts, isn't that appealing on some level?"
“Heat would like Russell Westbrook for free”  No shit
"I posted a trade idea about Minnesota in a three-team trade acquiring Westbrook, Gordon Hayward, and Gallinari while sending out Wiggins, Teague, Dieng, Covington, Okogie, 2 future 1sts and 4 future 2nds.  I was told by Minnesota fans that this was the worst possible trade I could think of and that they were giving up way too much (while admitting that Wiggins and Dieng were essentially net negative contracts).  It just seems to silly to me when you consider:  1.  Minnesota has made the playoffs once in the past 15 seasons (lost 1-4 to Houston, they had Jimmy Butler at the time)  2.  Towns is an UFA in 2024 and has no fricken reason at all to stay if the Timberwolves continue missing the playoffs from now til then (nearly a guarantee so long as Wiggins is taking up nearly a quarter of the cap)  3.  Westbrook/Culver/Hayward/Gallinari/Towns would be their best starting lineup in recent memory.  Hell, Westbrook would become the best point guard in franchise history.  This is a lineup where you're surrounding Towns with talent and showing him you're actually serious about competing.  I 100% would've understood OKC fans saying they're not getting enough back for taking on Wiggins and Dieng's contracts while giving up the face of their franchise, it seemed so damn silly to me that OKC fans had nothing much to say but Minnesota fans were coming in ready to say how bad an idea this trade would be.  For what it's worth, this is the trade idea I had in mind:  OKC sends:  Russell Westbrook, Steven Adams, Danilo Gallinari  OKC receives:  Andrew Wiggins, Jeff Teague, Gorgui Dieng, Josh Okogie, 2020 BOS 1st, 2021 MIN 1st, 2022 MIN 2nd, 2022 PHI or DEN 2nd (more favorable), 2023 MIN 1st  BOS sends:  Gordon Hayward, 2020 BOS 1st  BOS receives:  Steven Adams, Robert Covington, 2020 MIN 2nd, 2021 MIN 2nd  MIN sends:  Andrew Wiggins, Jeff Teague, Gorgui Dieng, Robert Covington, Josh Okogie, 2021 MIN 1st, 2023 MIN 1st, 4 second rounders  MIN receives:  Russell Westbrook, Gordon Hayward, Danilo Gallinari"
Russell Westbrook barely has a case over Chris Paul. Peak CP3 is just the better player than Peak Westbrook.
Yeah in all seriousness Bronny is more like the next Russell Westbrook or Kyrie Irving.
RuSsELl WeStBrOok SuCkS tHo
Chris Paul or John Wall = yes.  Russell Westbrook = not quite yet.
He’s too good to be a sixth man regardless of what team he’s playing for. There isn’t a single team in the league who would have Russell Westbrook on their roster coming off the bench.
That’s a weird way to spell Russell Westbrook.
So what you are saying is that even taking into consideration this new DRAYMOND metric 538 invented that Russ is a better defender than Klay who is regarded as one of the best defensive guards in the league    | PLAYER|OLD (BASED ON RPM AND BPM)|NEW (INCORPORATING DRAYMOND) | |:-|:-|:-| |Klay Thompson| \-0.91|\-0.34| |Russell Westbrook|\+1.16|\+0.02|

Paul George and Russell Westbrook
"Don't know if you follow the NFL but this kind of reminds me of when Jerry Jones was gonna pick Johnny Manziel in the draft, but his son Stephen talked him out of it. Except replace Jerry Jones with Pat Riley, drafting Johnny Manziel with trading for Russell Westbrook, and Stephen Jones with Heat staffers.  Kinda weird analogy but if this is true it seems like that might be what's happening here."
"Nobody is giving up a ton for him, but he's still Russell Westbrook, I feel like you've gotta be willing to give up at least a first rounder for him.  If I was an OKC fan and we gave up Westbrook for nothing I'd lose my shit, they might as well keep him and at least have a reason to watch games the next couple years."
Watch Jerry West fuck around and get Russell Westbrook too
"These are my predictions for the 2019-2020 season. East:  1. Bucks (Although Brogdon leaving will hurt, Giannis is only 24 and I see him improving even more next year)  2. 76ers (They got Horford, so I see this team having a successful season. Butler leaving hurts, but they added Horford, so the team won't suffer)  3. Celtics (Kemba basically replaces Kyrie. Losing Horford would really affect their defense. They got Kanter as replacement, but I don't see them as a better team compared to last year, although they're still a deep team)  4. Nets (Durant may be out for the whole season but Kyrie and DJ can lead this team to a Top 4 seed)  5. Pacers (They got Brogdon and Lamb to replace Bojan and Thad, who left Indiana. I see this team having around the same record as last year)  6. Heat (They finally have an alpha in Jimmy Butler to lead the team, and with the help of a great coach in Spo. I see Butler leading Miami to a 6th seed)  7. Raptors (Even without Kawhi, they're still a good team. They have Lowry, Gasol, Ibaka and Siakam. Siakam plus Anunoby improving will really help Raptors playoff position)  8. Pistons (Adding DRose is good for Detroit, and they can really improve even more as a top team with a Griffin-Drummond frontcourt, but I still see them as 8th seed due to other teams having depth)  9. Magic (They basically have the same team. With teams making improvements to their rosters, I don't see Orlando making the playoffs)  10. Hawks (Their team has a good young core with guys like Trae, Collins, Huerter, Hunter, Reddish. I see this team having some success with Trae leading the way. I see Trae doing even better next season)  11. Bulls (With Lavine, Markkanen and WCJ continuing to improve, I see them having some success just like Atlanta)  12. Wizards (Beal is going to do some carrying here. And, with Beal, this team is going to be around 12th spot in the East)  13. Knicks (They added guys like Randle, Gibson, Payton and Ellington, plus drafting RJ. Also, Knox and Dennis Smith improving. With that, they're going to be a little bit better than last year. But, that roster is not as good as Atlanta and Chicago)  14. Cavaliers (They got Garland-Sexton, an undersized backcourt. So, some mystery, but KLove's still a good player and he can lead the team to some more wins, but the depth isn't good enough and that's why they're 14th)  15. Hornets (They have Terry Rozier as their possibly best player. Their roster isn't good, so I see them being the worst team in the East)  West:  1. Clippers (Kawhi and PG13 duo with Beverley as their starting PG plus LouWill and Harrell off the bench. Kawhi and PG13 could rest some games, but this is a deep team, and I still see them taking the top seed in the West)  2. Lakers (LeBron, AD, Cousins, Kuzma with some shooting of Danny Green and Cook plus the defense of Avery Bradley. They got some good depth too and I see them having a great season)  3. Nuggets (This team is a deep team, and although they will drop from 2nd to 4th. The team is still better than last season. Jamal Murray and Jokic is only going to improve, with MPJ now playing. This team is going to do great)  4. Rockets (This is still a great team. This team took a full-powered GS to 7 2 seasons ago. There may be rumors of tension between CP3 and Harden, but this team is still a great team)  5. Jazz (Donovan Mitchell got some offensive help in Conley and Bogdanovic. Mitchell can have more space to operate and he could be even better next season. Although, the same position again in 5th, they're still a great team and Mitchell is only going to get better and better)  6. Trail Blazers (The West is still really good, and thats why Portland is just 6th. Dame, CJ and Nurkic is still really good, with Hood and Whiteside off the bench. That's still a good team. Just not as good as a team like Houston or Denver)  7. Warriors (Steph Curry is still really, really good. He could get back to his MVP form. And, he can still push GS to the playoffs even without Klay. They got all-star D'Angelo Russell to help)  8. Spurs (Never count out Pop. He's a legendary coach. Just last season, they were 7th seed without their starting PG. The West just got even better and that's why I have them at 8th)  9. Thunder (As of now, Westbrook is here. So I'm going to make the assumption that he's staying. The West is even more competitive now, so I don't see them making the playoffs. Even if Westbrook goes crazy with his stats)  10. Kings (This is a young team with Fox and Bagley leading the way. In order to make the playoffs in the West, you have to win around 45-50 games, and the Kings isn't good enough to win that much games yet)  11. Timberwolves (Right now, they made some small changes. But, it won't help the team improve, so it's on KAT to lead this team. He's still young so I see him improving next season)  12. Mavericks (Luka and Porzingis is a great young duo, but they're still years away from being a playoff contender due to the fact that they're in the West)  13. Pelicans (They have a good young core going on with Zion, Zo, Ingram, Hayes with Nickeil and Josh Hart off the bench. Plus, Jrue Holiday being the veteran and the leader. They're a team to look forward to. They're still really young, so I have them at 13th) 14. Grizzlies (Morant and JJJ. That's a duo we're going to look forward to in the future. But, still too young, so 14th seed)  15. Suns (Although they have DBook and Ayton, I don't see how adding Rubio and Saric get them to rise. With just DBook and Ayton, they only won 19 games. So I still have them as the worst team in the West)"

"My standings assume that Russell Westbrook is traded to the Heat before the season starts.  &amp;#x200B;  East:  1. Bucks 2. Sixers 3. Pacers 4. Celtics 5. Heat 6. Nets 7. Raptors 8. Pistons 9. Magic 10. Bulls 11. Wizards 12. Hawks 13. Knicks 14. Cavs 15. Hornets  &amp;#x200B;  West:  1. Nuggets 2. Jazz 3. Rockets 4. Clippers 5. Blazers 6. Warriors 7. Lakers 8. Spurs 9. Kings 10.

"They're referring to D'Angelo Russell, not Westbrook"
We've only seen Westbrook under two coaches that no one would consider to be elite in the NBA so I don't think it's fair to assume every coach would've reacted the same way to his play style. It's also not necessarily about asking Westbrook to completely chance his game. It's about asking him to play to the strengths that have made him a superstar and back off shooting inefficient 3s and long 2s.  Hassan Whiteside might not have played better but the Heat did. Donovans job is to win games not keep Russell Westbrook happy. After 3 years of the Westbrook show and no improvement  you focus  on making your team more likely to win games not doing the same thing that has kept you at 48 wins.   My whole point is in the Westbrook low trade value conversation no one seems to believe a change of scenery could lead to him playing much better. This is something a well coached team should factor into taking that risk in my opinion.
"I'll put it this way.  If Gary Payton played in todays game, he'd be Russell Westbrook who played elite defense."
"And I think this is your problem lol. You do realize that Mitchell put up 23.8 in his second year? And that the only ppl to put up more than that in year 2 out of current players is LeBron, KD, KAT, and Vince Carter.   So I find it pretty mind boggling that when those are the only 4 ppl to best you in ppg, and they're all HoFers/all Stars, that you don't see how Mitchell is an absolutely ridiculously talented player.   He dropped 40 like 4 times as a rookie. Including once in the playoffs where he was the ONLY shot creator of the the team as a ROOKIE and was the teams no. 1 option with a usage rate higher than anyone in the league except James Harden. And he knocked the MVP Russell Westbrook AND Paul George out of the playoffs. Again, as a rookie, and the only go-to scorer on the entire team.   I'll also remind you that the jazz were a projected lottery team after losing Hayward and were absolutely TERRIBLE to start the season because Rodney hood ran the show... That all changed when Mitchell specifically dropped 40 in a game mid season and became the starter.   If he was doing the exact same thing, but for the Knicks, Lakers, Celtics, etc. Everyone would act like he's the second coming of Jesus. You're just wildly underrating him.   So what about any of that isn't alpha to you."

"Looking through the projected for a lot of these players really puts this list in question.  For most young promising players the model expects them to improve next season or two and then more or less plateau at 8-9 WAR at best (basically all star niveau) for the next few years.  [Luka Doncic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/luka-doncic/)  [Ben Simmons](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/ben-simmons/)  [KAT](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/karl-anthony-towns/)  [Embiid](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/joel-embiid/)  [Tatum](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/jayson-tatum/)  It's similar for most young good players. For some reason the model really likes Lonzo and expects him to really keep improving.  It also doesn't expect improvements on good players to last and expects them to be outliers which might be true in some cases but less so in others  [Giannis](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/giannis-antetokounmpo/)  [Jokic](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/nikola-jokic/)  [PG](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/paul-george/)  Lastly the model predicts most stars around 30 to really regress the next few years.  [Harden](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/james-harden/)  [Curry](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/stephen-curry/)  [LeBron](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/lebron-james/)  This one might actually be because of his injury so the model thinks he got significantly worse this year.  [Westbrook](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/russell-westbrook/)  He is predicted to be better next year but then declines.  [PG again](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/paul-george/)  [Kawhi](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/kawhi-leonard/)  Overall it seems like the model is very cookie cutter for young players and older player, because young player will improve some more and then stay the same for a few years and older players simply get worse the older they get. It doesn't really recongnize if a player can be expected to be great or if a player has a game that ages well.  It also fails to interpret rapid improvement properly. Jokic, Giannis and PG are expected to be at their older levels next year despite their improvements this season.  All in all it seems very generalized and something everyone could tell you. Young players improve and older players get worse but it lacks individualism."
"RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS STILL A TOP 12-15 PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE AND HAS PLENTY VERY GOOD YEARS LEFT IN HIM AND HE IS NOT A SALARY DUMP.  MULTIPLE TEAMS HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN TRADING FOR HIM AND HIS ""NEGATIVE ASSET"" CONTRACT BECAUSE THEY THINK HE WILL HELP MAKE THEIR TEAM A CONTENDER. DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A SALARY DUMP."
Russell westbrook is better than justise winslow? Hot take tbh.
"Russell Westbrook contract is a negative contract . He's going to get paid 47mil at 34. A lot of teams are not lining up to get Westbrook . The teams are Miami, piston , and Houston ."
"Jimmy Butler, Kevin Love,  and Russell Westbrook. Go for it Pat Riley!"
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Blake Griffin. That's the first 15 that come to my mind since 2015. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are on the edge."
"Russell Westbrook is in San Diego as well, there's a photo of him in gaslamp on his insta"
"Empty stats don't win games, ask Russell Westbrook"
"I actually think that now would be the time to rebuild in the west if you do not have the pieces to compete.   In 5 years.   Chris Paul 39  Lebron James 39  Lamarcus Aldridge 38  Mike Conley 36  Danilo Gallinari 35  Russell Westbrook 35  Demar DeRozan 34  Draymond Green 34  James Harden 34  Paul George 34  (Kahwi Leonard 33)  CJ McCollum 32  Rudy Gobert 32  So, there will be a changing of the guard in the West.   If you're not in a position to win a title, then I believe it would be wise to pull a Phili and tank for assets.   Phoenix can ride this wave right into contention. Rubio is a bridge to draft and develop a PG. With the Booker and Ayton, I believe they are doing the right thing at the moment"
D’Angelo Russell Westbrook Lopez Pachulia Stoudimaire
Bill Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is also in San Diego.
Warriors even without KD are a way better team than the thunder and even having Dangelo instead of Klay for most of the season I think the warriors are still better. Thunder so far has not improved their mediocre squad this offseason and Westbrook is only going to get worse. He didnt even play like a top 25 player this last playoffs. That's how bad he was. Dude was a straight up worse player than guys like DeMar DeRozan and Blake Griffin this playoffs. The warriors duo of Draymond green/steph curry is better than Paul george/Westbrook and Russell/looney/McKinnie is better than adams/grant/Schroder. I dont think having ferguson and noel instead of Livingston and WCS is enough to overcome the big gap in top end talent.
"Yeah but somehow he still took all the shots, meaning that he was getting triple teamed and wasn't passing until the 6ers days. Then in phili, he reportedly used to pad assist numbers ala Russell Westbrook."
"Lol... I never said Rozier was as good as Westbrook, what I'm saying is that when it comes to rebounding Rozier is very similar stylistically to Westbrook.  Pull your head out of BBRef and actually watch what those two do once they rebound the ball. Rozier and Westbrook are both hyper-athletic guards that like to grab the rebound and use it to push the tempo which puts the defenders on the back foot.   Using defensive rebounds to generate high-quality offensive possessions isn't a new idea and it's a real shame you don't seem to appreciate that as a Celtics fan. It was a big part of Bill Russell and Bob Cousey winning all those championships.   There are two key ways you can use defensive rebounds well:  1. The traditional way is to use an outlet pass like Russell+Cousey (or recently [Love+Lebron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C34bBtDz0gc)).   2. What OKC do is different. Adams boxes out for Westbrook and Westbrook grabs the ball and immediately pushes the tempo. It means they don't have to waste time with Adams feeding Westbrook the ball, they've essentially cut out the middleman.  For the past two years, Boston has focused on option 2. It's how we jumped from 26th in rebounding (2016-17) to 13th (2017-18) without any of our bigs putting up big rebounding numbers.    Our bigs (especially Baynes) focus on boxing out, our guards/wings grab the rebounds. A lot of our players grab the rebound then jog up the court. Rozier has been similar to Westbrook in that he uses rebounds to push the tempo.   [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWUQyTzC7KQ). Watch how quickly he's able to run up the floor, he's going to reach the half-court line with 20+ seconds on the clock and he's got all the defenders on the back foot. What that means is we're probably going to catch one of the defenders off-balance or out of position.  Yes, it's called a *defensive rebound* but if you do it right then it has a really positive impact on the very next offensive play.   If you listened to Brian Scalabrine or Brad Stevens this season you would have heard them talk about it."

"Or DeAngelo Russell Westbrook if you want to keep it current. Let’s face it, they all beat Carmelo Anthony Davis."
"I had been thinking about this myself recently, best I could do was D’Angelo Russell Westbrook Lopez."
"I think it was Zach Lowe or someone who said ""Russell Westbrook attacks the rim like it knocked up his sister"" lmao"
"At 39 Jordan was taking 18.6 SPG for 20 PPG. I think that's pretty good for an old fogie.  For context, Klay Thompson this past season averaged 18.0 SPG for 21.5 PPG. That's just a hair under your standard. And he's only 28. Russell Westbrook was worse: 20.2 SPG for 22.9 PPG."

Seems a bit of a stretch to compare Westbrook and Bill Russell in terms of offense either. Lebron is much better than both of them.
Russell Westbrook. Dude beasted against the Grizz.

Russell Westbrook vs KD be like
"Great points.  &amp;#x200B;  Jordan and Kobe were the only wing players in my lifetime (born in 1986) that you feel like could do anything at anytime.  Tracy McGrady and AI had moments like that but MJ/Mamba were on a different level.  &amp;#x200B;  As a Mavericks fan, I used to get sick anytime Kobe had the ball.  He was streaky but so damn good.  The best way to explain it in modern terms is someone that can get hot and take crazy shots from range like Steph but has athletic ability that's closer (not exactly but closer) to Russell Westbrook...and then put that on a 6'7"" frame.  Just not fair.  And then Jordan was like that but a bit craftier with his hands a probably a little stronger physically."
*\*Russell Westbrook has entered the chat\**
"And yet, they're still less relevant.  They could've had one of the most marketable players in their highlight prime in Blake Griffin and all they could get him was some bits and parts on comedy central or something.  Meanwhile, laker legends like Jordan Clarkson was banging Victorias secret models, Shannon brown married Monica, Jordan farmar got acting cameos on TV, Julius Randle was in a commercial for mountain dew with Jimmy Butler and Russell Westbrook.   Even local businesses used laker players."
