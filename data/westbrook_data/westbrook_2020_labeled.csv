I really fuck with Russell Westbrook and James Harden as a duo in my head but like James Harden needs to be the shooting guard not the one,1
the team he would be leaving doesnt have another MVP caliber player Russell Westbrook so basically I feel like that would be significantly less Snake Like on Gianniss part idk    this combined with what everybody else said and nah Giannis would have a chill transition going to GSW imo,1
Russell Westbrook is playing great for the Rockets on 24 points 7 assists and 8 rebounds yet he gets no credit due to James Hardens outstanding performances,1

Hes a plus defender an incredible rebounder and sees the floor very well Russell Westbrook with 4 others around who can shoot makes it so much easier for him to excel with his tool set I personally believe he can be a number 1 guy and I believe him and harden compliment each other well,1
Russell Westbrook has been excellent lately  What bothers me however is that at the moment Harden and Westbrook cant seem to be hot at the same time  This will be necessary in the playoffs if the Rockets want to go far,1
I am become Russell Westbrook the layer of 3 point bricks,0
Na he just needs to do Russell westbrook shit Always drive at the rim dont be scared of getting fouled and make ur free throws  If he does that and plays elite defence then he is a top 10 player,1
