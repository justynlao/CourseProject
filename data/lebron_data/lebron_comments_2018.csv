James Harden is better than Lebron and its been that way all season
Makes it even more bizarre that LeBron James got MJ's average **4** times  Edit: he's responsible for about 10% of all instances of that stat line in history
Trae Young - Luke Doncic - Lebron James - Kevin Love - Javale Mcgee  your 2019 NBA champion cavs 
I'm still not putting any money on any team going up against LeBron James in the regular season. He has a track record of going full playoff mode in random ass games even in bad stretches. Anything could happen tonight.
"Of course I don't expect LeBron James of all players to shoot 40% from three  I was expecting like 35-36%, but at this point he's been awful from three for the majority of the season. "
"Kanter talks a lot of shit in general. His own country disavowed him and now he’s stateless and has been disowned by his family. He doesn’t back down. He took on Erdogon, you think he’s afraid of LeBron James? "
"It had to do with getting LeBron on the heat as quick as possible so they could have their pep rally.  The heat had to clear some cap space to sign Bosh, Haslem and LeBron and the only way to get him on the heat quickly was through a sign and trade.  Kind of funny.  A good [read](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11588922/the-three-year-plan-lure-lebron-james-back-cleveland) if you have the time:  &gt;The Cavaliers began the unlikely process of getting James back to Cleveland roughly 12 hours after he announced his intention to leave.  &gt;It was the morning of July 9, 2010. Then-Cavs GM Chris Grant picked up his ringing phone. It was Pat Riley, and he wanted to trade for LeBron. The Heat could have signed James outright -- he was a free agent, after all -- but they were working on side deals to clear cap space for several other players, including Chris Bosh, Mike Miller and Udonis Haslem, and they needed a James sign-and-trade to make the math work out. Riley's initial offer: a single second-round pick in the 2012 NBA draft. The call ended unpleasantly.  &gt;Reeling in the wake of James' decision, Grant took Riley's offer to team owner Dan Gilbert, who just hours earlier had written a searing screed against James on the Cavaliers' official website, accusing him of a ""cowardly betrayal.""  &gt;Grant knew they had to do it. Fueled by some mix of anger and desperation, the Cavs countered: two first-round picks, two second-round picks and the option to swap picks with Miami in the 2012 draft.  &gt;It would be an unprecedented haul for an unprecedented player, a ridiculous counteroffer to make for a guy who already said he belonged to Miami. It was also a shrewd move.  &gt;Turns out, the Heat had a pressing self-imposed deadline: The team was throwing a party for its new Big Three later that night. It was a sold-out rock concert, complete with dry ice, hydraulic lifts and a light show.  &gt;The two teams found themselves in a high-stakes game of chicken, the Cavs desperate to make up for the loss of the NBA's best player and the Heat eager to celebrate a new era in Miami basketball. James and Bosh were sitting in the Heat's offices, waiting for the paperwork, excited to sign. Miami swerved first, giving the Cavs their four picks. It was the first time Cleveland had traded for a first-round pick in eight years.  "
"Steph Curry's thrown mouthguard.  The first goal Shaq destroyed in the NBA (assuming it wasn't already a part of his tree.) Also one of Shaq's shoes, just for the absurd size.  The cup that caused Ron Artest to punch the wrong fan in the stands.  Any of the black masks players have worn (Kyrie, Lebron, etc.)  The last can of powder Michael Jordan used in a game.  Whatever can of hairspray Nick Young uses to keep his hair like that.  James Worthy's goggles.  EDIT: Steve Kerr's broken clipboard"

"[**ESPN**] Nets Pick wants out of Cleveland, is this LeBron James fault?!!!"
Why would a team want to trade Lebron James?
"Is LeBron no longer a top 100 player?  I am a cavs fan, but I genuinely believe after watching this season that multiple players have surpassed Lebron.

Rudy Gobert is a better basketball player than lebron James. When this day comes to fruition I will no longer.... I don't even know lol
"&gt;	Lebron James is an incredible basketball player, but the past few years, he’s played only one side of the ball.   Seems like you missed the whole 2016 NBA finals. LeBron is better than Steph defensively. LeBron is a better facilitator than KD. LeBron is a better passer, better scorer, and a better playmaker than Kawhi. "
LeBron James this season vs. James Harden in 2015-16 (the season the Rockets went 41-41 and he didn't make an All-NBA team) 
"&gt;Imagine if Lebron James wasnt on that team  He is tho...  And even then, KLove would be the main player (assuming he’s healthy in his scenario) and we’ve already seen him carry shit TWolves teams to 35-40 wins  They might not make the playoffs, but they wouldn’t be the worst team"
"&gt;LeBron is still considered the best player in the league  Based on what? Talking heads saying he’s the best? Steph Curry is better offensively. KD is a better scorer, and his defense is better. Kawhi is as efficient and a superior defender. Lebron plays zero defense. I for one don’t care what the talking heads are saying. Lebron James is an incredible basketball player, but the past few years, he’s played only one side of the ball. You don’t play zero defense and still get to be the best player in the world. Not anymore. "
"[Here's my incredibly likely trade](https://imgur.com/2aT5UmN) that will definitely happen:  **Celtics** get: **LeBron James**  **Cavaliers** get: **Gordon Hayward**, **Jayson Tatum**, **Reggie Jackson**, DET 2020 1st (Top 5 protected), swap rights with DET 2019 2nd  **Pistons** get: **Channing Frye**, **Isaiah Thomas**  Why the Celtics do this: They cash in chips, become immediate contenders, feel comfortable LeBron will resign since he waived his NTC, and LeBron is reunited with his son  Why the Cavs do this: They kickstart life without LeBron and Kyrie with two (hopefully) perennial allstars and a little draft material. They could still be a top team in the East in 2018-19.  Why the Pistons do this: SVG is feeling the heat and needs an upgrade next to Blake and Andre. He gets Reggie off the books for the price of some draft picks that he won't develop by the time he's fired in 2020 and can go hunting for a missing piece. My brain isn't developed enough to add a fourth team to the equation.  "
Who isnt better than the Cavs. Imagine if Lebron James wasnt on that team. They should be the worst team in the league
"While a genetic freak, he just can't handle the offense and defensive load like he used to, I saw that [The Cleveland Cavaliers' defensive rating ranks dead last in the NBA (111.7) when Lebron James is on the court. When he is off the court, their defensive rating skyrockets to 103.5, good for the sixth best defense in the league.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7ucof0/the_cleveland_cavaliers_defensive_rating_ranks/)  He's been having to shoulder such an offensive load he just doesn't have the same tank left in him to do that on defense too.  With Pop he wouldn't have to do either 100% and could become an elite defender again, exerting his energy on the defensive side where he is a legit monster."
"Calling it now, HUGE game for Bron tonight. He's inspired by James Harden's performance, and Love is out so he gives up on passing. It's time to take back the record for most points scored by a Cavalier. He promised Irving was only borrowing that title. Lebron for 62 lego."

Mavs GM, Mark Cuban: ""It's amazing. Beyond amazing. He's on another level from any other player at this point. It's like he is toying with teams.

It's so senseless to me to say he shouldn't take over like that. You give the same amount of shots to everybody else and they're not making that many, I know it. Players are jealous of greatness. Kobe is a unique talent and a unique person. His belief that he can jump to the moon is never going to change. But I admire him, what he's been able to overcome. You would think he would be a fair-haired man of the NBA with what's he's already done. But he's taken a fairly good battering.  Ex-Bull and now-Analyst Steve Kerr: ""I'm always one to credit the guys who win. I don't know if I would have given Kobe the M.V.P. last week. But what he did in the game last night, he's so clearly the best player out there.""   “Kobe is probably the best player in the world, so he should make a major difference,” Bird says. “I see him doing the same thing for today’s team that Michael Jordan did for us back in ‘92.”  Only morons think he was never the best.

"I think Kobe (like Dirk in the fact that they both stuck with one squad throughout their career) is also like Dirk in that he was ever present and ever great. You could turn on a game night in and night out for either player and know that you were going to see a hall of famer performing at the highest level of excellence each and every game. I think there would never be any consensus on when Kobe was considered the ""best player"" in the league versus other players because you can always make arguments for any of the top 5 or top 8 players. For Lebron James to have gone on a finals run like he has over the last (is it 8 seasons?) you could definitely make an argument that he should be considered the best player over the last decade nearly. I think the only reason he stopped getting MVP votes was voter fatigue from the media, wanting to sell a new narrative. I mean the dude is a TANK. I don't know where I'm going with any of this. Back to the start, Kobe will always be a top player in my mind and I think his legacy as a player, and who he is as a man outside of basketball now are both looking better and better as time passes. Shea Serrano has an annoying ass voice. Dude is just saying bull shit now because Obama liked one of his books. Not a fan. "
Imagine if Westbrook or Lebron had this stat line. We would be hearing about it from ESPN and the media in general for like a month.  James Harden is truly the most under appreciated star in the league.

"Dumping Bayless is only an 8.5 mil difference because he actually makes *less* money next year. 52 Million of cap space is just cap holds for Redick, Johnson, and Booker.   I'm not sure how much of that they can clear by renouncing the bird rights for those players, but they need around 30 million to max Paul George and 35 million to max Lebron James. I don't think trading Bayless changes the math for that very much."
"He's a star but not a superstar   He's not the face of his brand like KD, LeBron, Westbrook, James, and Curry. However he is a top 10 player like Giannis, AD and CP3. "
Yeah lmao size doesn’t have anything to do with 6’8 250lb Lebron James being the most athletic player this decade 
"He's at 69.3% on the season from &lt;5 ft, [2nd amongst all ""guards"" who shoot at least 2 at the rim a game](http://stats.nba.com/players/shooting/?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*:Less%20Than%205%20ft.%20FGA*GE*2&amp;sort=Less%20Than%205%20ft.%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G). And yes, the ""guard"" ahead of him is LeBron James."
The following list is **my opinion**. I have arguments for every ''controversial'' pick (Westbrook over Curry and Harden in particular).  1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Russell Westbrook  4) Stephen Curry  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Giannis Antetokounmpo  8) Kawhi Leonard (despite being injured for almost the whole season)  9) DeMarcus Cousins  10) Jimmy Butler  11) Chris Paul  12) **Kyrie Irving**  13) Paul George  14) DeMar DeRozan  15) John Wall  16) Damian Lillard  17) Karl Anthony Towns  18) Joel Embiid  19) LaMarcus Aldridge  20) Kristaps Porzingis
I think he'd want to be a majority owner so he'd have to get a group of 6 or more.  Totally doable. He's LeBron fucking James.
"As long as the Cavs make the Playoffs, they are winning their First Round matchup. Nobody wants to see LeBron James in the playoffs (except for the Warriors)."
Lebron James is hard to build around. He's a good athlete no doubt but the problem is he can essentially play 4 positions and he could switch whenever he wants which makes it difficult for other players on the team to know what role they should be playing.  Easiest? Probably like Paul George. He showed he could be the guy on the Pacers. This year he's showing how he could play off the ball with Westbrook and still be dominating. Guy can also play lockdown defense. His game is just too versatile. 
&gt;Score is 97-96 Cavs with 0:02 left in the shot clock—Miami has called a timeout   &gt;And hold up to your seats Heat fans there seems to be a player running out of the Heat’s locker room   &gt;I think that is... wait a minute sure it can’t! It’s Mario Chalmers!   &gt;Winslow inbounds pass to Rio! He takes it down the lane and DUNKS IT OVER LEBRON JAMES FOR THE WIN   &gt;Refs call illegal nuts to the face technical foul but the game is over! It’s over! Heat win!
"That's pretty interesting. The average NBA team is officially about revenue neutral (not really, but that's what's on the books). The rich teams- LAL, GS, CHI, and NYK, are coming out like $50-100M ahead every year. I'd imagine that they would pour all of that into their designated player. That sets the ballpark for the contracts, anyway  I think it's entirely plausible that any of those teams would give Lebron James $100M, and if he turned it down they'd offer a similar number to Kevin Durant."
"Off the top of my head.. James Harden, LeBron James, Chris Paul"
I think they should be allowed to draft players. LeBron James Jr. to replace John Wall
"1. Attach a pick to Ryno and ship him off to a tanking team (will be much easier than last offseason because he will have one less year left on his contract)  2. We have CP3's bird rights so we can go over the cap to give him the max.  3. Lebron has stated that [he *would* take a paycut to play with his best friends](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/03/lebron-james-dwyane-wade-chris-paul-carmelo-anthony-pay-cut-superteam) (we wouldn't be able to afford Melo but Wade would sign for vet min and that'd be 3 out of 4 banana boaters)  4. Capela's not gonna just take the first offer and run - he likes it in Houston so I'd be willing to bet he'd wait 5-10 days to re-sign with us.  5. While Ariza is important to the team - he absolutely is expendable when it comes to a potential Lebron signing. So either he signs for cheap with us to ring chase or we replace him with one of the many vets that flock to wherever Lebron goes.  CP3, Harden, Lebron, Capela, Wade, Mbah A Moute, Ariza (possibly), Tucker, Nene, Green + a couple of vets that follow Lebron would absolutely be better than our current squad - and Morey is more than capable of making it happen."
"Lebron James has played 15 NBA seasons and basically 2 more if you include the post season and has never been hurt. There are iron men in every generation, but nowadays players bodies won't be ruined after they retire. Tons of players who used to play literally can't walk because they didn't know proper treatment for injuries and/or couldn't tell what was actually wrong. "
"then why not think the same thing about Durant?  - Durant sees james take control of his destiny and win chips boost his legacy , durant sees this team in the warriors that he knows he will lose to playing with westbrook, has an opportunity to join what could soon be considered the best team of all time, wins a chip, FMVP, possibly another 2-3-4 finals   to me its the same think lebron did but all the lebron fans are all pissed cause now lebrons legacy is where it is and he aint winning again so they get all butt-hurt about it "
"Of course it was also LeBron's *fault*. The league encouraged a graduated increase in the cap over the course of several years, which would have prevented the best team in the league from adding maybe the best player in the league through free agency. The players' Union, headed by Chris Paul and LeBron James, rejected that proposal and insisted on the full increase in year one. End result: best player joins already the best team, further cap increases don't materialize, rest of league can't add similar payroll."

sometimes lebron james reminds me of machamp minus the extra limbs.
"There's all sorts of arguments if you are using the regular season, he's been as good as anyone the last couple years. The issue is that the post season is where players really define themselves and Harden has consistently been really really good but not great. If he wants to be considered on the same tier as some of the other superstars in the league he needs to step up to the moment.

"As a die-hard Rockets and James Harden fan:  The fact is, James has a reputation for high-production scoring off fouls, a Shaqtin-worthy history of suspect defense, and specific moments of underperforming in crucial playoff games, which are easy to criticize and meme about. Whether or not those have fluctuated recently is less relevant than the fact that people tend to hold on to their held perceptions, [even when presented contradictory evidence](https://www.theoatmeal.com/comics/believe). And no matter what, it's unambiguously true that he's never made it to the Finals.  It's hard to overlook this kind of bias. Hell, it's taken me years to get to the point where I at least respect Draymond's all-around contributions *without* flying into a white-hot rage about his antics, dirty play, and personality, and dismissing his numbers outright. There's a similar reasoning behind why Boogie was seen as the ugly stepsister of the NBA in his Sacramento years.  I imagine the conventional or mainstream fan has a hard time looking past even the most stellar box score numbers or advanced stats because these reputational components tend to taint any performance by Harden. Players and fans typically expect unambiguously superb 2-way and/or playoff success before a player enters the ""top 3"" conversation. Then, add in that he isn't the most physically dominant player (though his deceptive acceleration and agility would beg to differ), certainly not the flashiest, and it's not hard to see why it's hard to relate to him through convention.   Compare this to other MVP ""contenders"" and it's easy to see why they pass the ""shit test"":  * Steph is already the greatest 3-point shooter in NBA history, has championship rings, and a blemish-free personal life and personality. You could criticize his underwhelming iso defense, or that his success has come from capitalizing off of the league's blind eye to moving screens, but those are forgivable at-large. The shit doesn't stick. Besides, what person wouldn't find it easy to shoot a 3 and imagine they're Curry?  * LeBron is the epitome of physical dominance and has no glaring skills gaps. He took his lumps before winning his first championship, sure, and he flops more than you'd expect for someone of his size and strength. You can still relate to his game, though, and his production is easy to trumpet in SportsCenter headlines. Again, the shit doesn't stick.  * KD I'm not even going to bother writing about  Furthermore, when players are talked about as a ""MVP candidate"", bias remains because memory of previous seasons or playoffs bleeds into people's perceptions, even when MVP is a regular-season award *for that year*.   So you have this phenomenon where it's hard for the average player or fan to overlook James' mixed resume and consider him a top 2 or 3 player, even when he's widely agreed-upon as the MVP front-runner. "
"I mean, if we're picking *any* player from *any* era then the following team of Monstars would curb-stomp the present day Warriors. If these players are all in their primes:   PG: Stephen Curry   SG: Michael Jordan   SF: JR   PF: Lebron James  C: IT"
"Consider it your wakeup call.  He's their second best player and the offense will now fully rely on LeBron James to either score or distribute on every single player outside of IT's inefficient baskets.  To stay up in the standings LeBron is going to need to shut off his regular season coasting and cary the team the next 2 months, which will most likely exhaust him come playoffs. "
"The message is clear and the voices unanimous. No longer shall we be shackled by the preconceived notions that there exists more than one player in the NBA better than James Harden. No longer shall we adhere to the outdated cries of fans worldwide screaming for justification of former MVPs. No longer shall we bar James Harden from the top two players in the NBA. Flopper. Choker. Slut. All of the insults James Harden has endured, they're toppling before our very eyes. He's getting to the rim on instinct. Facilitating remarkable offensive comebacks. Practicing abstinence. It's undeniably remarkable, as evidenced by both our eyes and statistics alike. He's a close second in PER at 31.35. Virtually tied for second with EWA of 8.7 (8.8 Giannis, 10.5 LeBron). Operating at the highest PTS/48 out of any qualified player. He retains jaw-dropping efficiency while operating at the highest USG% in the NBA this year- a full percentage point ahead of Russell Westbrook. Right now, LeBron James and James Harden are in a league of their own. It's irrefutable. Indisputable. Now that we have that established, let's explore how the rise of James Harden occurred. October 27, 2012. Rain trickles down the glass slopes of Harden's mansion. Perhaps it's a symbol of his pain- they are window panes, after all- or perhaps it's just precipitation. Irrelevant. James Harden scrolls through his phone, reading analytical pieces regarding his departure to the Houston Rockets. A single tear falls in unison with the pouring rain. The tear trickles down his cheek, gently running over his chocolate skin with the benevolent care of the hottest-chested nurse. It smoothly pours into Harden's world-beating beard, renowned and adored by NBA fans worldwide. Had anybody been there to witness it, they themselves would have cried directly into the beard of Harden as well. But what happened when Harden fell asleep that night? Do you think that he slept like a normal person? Fuck no. The guy was just traded. Surprisingly, though, he slept well. Perhaps better than he ever had. The clock strikes 3 AM, making no sound because it is a digital clock and an alarm is not set. But that's irrelevant too. James is encapsulated in a dream. He sits atop a snowy mountaintop, completely nude. It's not sexual, mind you, it simply reflects his newfound sense of isolation and feelings of vulnerability. He places his head down and cries quietly, snowflakes settling gently on his lightly tattooed breast. Again, a tear trickles down into his beard. Harden looks up with bloodshot eyes, wondering how he will continue on without his counterparts in Oklahoma City. Suddenly, he makes out a figure. It's indistinct, a shadowy presence of sorts that stands before him on the peak. It begins to speak. ""James, stand up."" He stands up. ""I understand an occurrence of great negative magnitude precipitated ere the eve of the previous night. It's a tragedy, really. An injustice of no bounds. You see, I'm Seattle born-and-raised. That team was my livelihood. The bane of my existence. Then it got ripped away from me- James, I'm here to help you get revenge. Don't freak the fuck out."" The shadowy figure extends an arm towards Harden, reaching for his beard. The shadow suddenly slips and falls- it's snowing outside- and his hand instead wallops into Harden's dick. It caresses the ungodly bounds of Harden's downstairs forest, seemingly enchanting it with a cascade of mystical woodland nymphs. It begins to glow. ""James, you're blessed now. Enchanted. Every game, every night when you see those fans cheering for you from the stands, your pants beard will glow with heavenly bioluminescence. It will grant you mystical powers, you will draw contact at will, shoot at will, and you will attract former Los Angeles players for absolutely no reason."" ""Also, you have chlamydia now. It only stops itching when you eurostep lmao"" And for the next five years, Harden shot and eurostepped his way to unequivocal stardom, fighting a courageous battle with chlamydia along the way. For these reasons, we must recognize him as the second best player in the NBA behind Lou Williams, who is patient zero for three distinct types of gonorrhea. Thanks for reading.  "
"I would want LeBron James to take his talents to Utah, but then I'd be afraid of us losing every home game of the season."
"""Oh you feel sick huh? Well now you get to sit 2 months, still feeling sick kev"" - Lebron James (probably)"
"This guy knows whats up. I think anyone who actually watches Cavs games knows that Lebron deserves partial blame for the Cavs' struggles. I would take Harden, Curry, KD, Westbrook, hell even CP3 over Lebron James in the regular season. However, when it hits playoffs, the man is in a tier of his own."
"There's an argument that could be made for the Golden boys, also an argument to be made that LeBron is the 2nd best James."
"We live in such a great era. A man like James Harden, who would be called the GOAT in the 80s, isn't considered better than the Top 3 in the NBA (Curry, Lebron, KD)."
"I kinda want to see LeBron go to Houston and do really well just so one day ""James"" ""Harden"" hangs in the rafters.     "
"He was both the more exciting rookie and the more hyped. I would remember going out of my way as a kid from Canada to watch any Lebron game when he first started out. From his crazy athleticism (so the dunks) and to the flashes of brilliance (his passing ability and overall feel for the game). He wasn't consistent yet nor a top player but it was fun seeing such a prodigy.  Blake in his ""rookie"" year was super entertaining with how powerful and explosive he was (his early dunks were downright scary) but he wasn't as fun to watch as a rookie as a Lebron James."
"The MVP race last year was a lot closer than this year though, and it was known to be one of the closest of all time.   This year hasn't been that way at all. There was some competition for like the first 2 weeks, but now James is just head and shoulders over everyone else. LeBron and Giannis were up there, but both of their teams have fallen off since Thanksgiving. "

LeBron James is a thing 
"Aldridge is the best if you wanna win a championship. He can give you enough rim protection and defense against the likes of lebron James and Kevin Durant while also being decent enough on the perimeter. He can still abuse smaller defenders inside with his post game and while he doesn't have the spacing horford or love does he still has good spacing with his elite mid range.   Horford next, he is defensively pretty great but against the elite teams he can be abused. He's been destroyed by lebron time and time again (not that many can say they haven't) and Durant, kawhi, harden etc aren't really deterred by him. Offensively he's better than aldridge with his distribution ability but in the playoffs id still rather have aldridges tough shot making and post game.   Love is the worst for a contender but the best for a bad team. No defense, but the offensive player of the bunch. Knock down shooting and spacing as well as elite rebounding. His defense will kill you tho against the elite teams"
"I think the problem is fans are fans of TEAMS not just a specific player. But a single player or a couple players can become the face of the franchise. So when the face of the franchise wants to leave, fans feel betrayed. But when their team makes a deal that benefits the future of the team (and, by extension, their fandom) fans are more forgiving.  James isn't wrong. But he isn't looking at it from the fans perspective. There are some *just* LeBron fans. But by and large, they are *Cavs* fans, so LeBron choosing to leave would *be seen as* disloyal."
"&gt; Deron Williams did suck did on the Cavs but that's because he was old and broken down from injuries  Funny, because Boozer broke his right hand as he joined the Bulls, needed surgery, and was out for a longtime --  hence older and declining performance after his prime in Utah. Deron is also the same age as LeBron James.  &gt; I compared Jordans 5th year (4th technically cause he was out for a year) to Lebron's 4th boy what an ass am i  You seem to fail to realize that Jordan was 22 as a rookie, so the 4th vs 5th season argument doesn't hold much weight. Jordan was over 26 years old years old compared to LeBron being 22. This absolutely matters. "
"Ultimately, sports taps into the basic tribalism of humans. It's why people spend billions of dollars supporting their favorite teams, dedicate their lives to discussing it, and all those nice things that cause the players to make millions of dollars from it. Not saying that the abuse KD and Lebron get is justified, but it's that tribalism that brings in the revenue. If people weren't emotionally invested in their team in this way (i.e I hate x player for leaving my team or I hate x player for going to another team and ruining the chance of my team winning), the financial investment wouldn't be there either. I get why Lebron feels it's a double standard, and that's cause it is. But that investment in one's favorite franchise is the biggest building block in the commercialization of sport. Take that away and Lebron James doesn't become LEBRON JAMES for being Lebron James on the court."
"Nobody will try and tell you that the whole run was impressive, but here's why I think beating Detroit and making the Finals itself was a big accomplishment:  * The roster wasn't full of guys with solid playoff reputations. You hear a lot of comments about how it was Lebron+nobody, and this is somewhat rooted in truth. The roster played well enough together, but there was literally zero star power after Lebron- and even his status was still in question as it was only his third year in the league. Despite the relatively anonymous roster, as another commenter pointed out, the team defense was actually pretty good (Mike Brown was always known as a defensive minded coach) * The Cavs franchise had only won 5 playoff series since joining the league in 1970. Neutral observers would give the benefit to the experienced Pistons team. * Lebron wasn't ""Playoff Lebron"" yet, and we didn't even know that it was a possibility until game five, really. * The Pistons were still viewed as heavy favorites in the East because they were not that far removed from back to back Finals appearances with a lot of the same core. * The Pistons has just won a 7 game series against Cleveland the year before after being down 3-2, which had created this illusion that beating them was some myth that would elude Lebron until he ""learned how to win"" (especially since MJ also kept running into Detroit before his teams finally broke through).  * The Pistons won the first two games by identical scores- one where Lebron took the final shot and missed, the other where he passed it to Donyell Marshall in the corner and he missed. I don't know how this one helps, but I remember him getting criticism after both games- from ""Lebron can't hit the big shot"" to ""Lebron is afraid to take the big shot"" and ""Lebron's teammates suck"" over the course of two games.  It was a much bigger deal at the time because it was the first time that Lebron's hype was actually delivered upon, imo. It's pretty easy to look back now and say ""well no shit they made the finals. the East sucked and they had Lebron freakin' James."""

"If you think Chris Paul and LeBron James had a serious opinion on whether or not to allow ""cap smoothing"", then ive got news."
"If he was that good of defender then he would've gotten at least a vote, we are talking about Lebron James who was one of the most hyped prospects and extremely popular player so there is no chance he got snubbed.  Its actually pretty correct since it pinpoints that team actually was good defensively and not Lebron being amazing on defense and carrying them there."
Bro that's not even the best picture of that play. [This](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2016/06/20/lebron-james-block-nba-finals-game-7-video.jpg) or [this](https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160628__LEBRON-BLOCK1.jpg?w=645&amp;h=975) are better
"&gt; Sure, but him winning championships with the warriors does absolutely nothing to add to his legacy. They were winning those championships with or without him, riding the coattails of the best team in modern NBA history is a neutral addition to his resume at best.  I'd gotta disagree. Even if the Warriors would've won regardless of if he was on the team, he still won FMVP while outplaying Lebron James to have one of the best Final series of all time. I can understand not valueing it as highly as other championshipals or FMVPs, but it is still quite the accolade that adds to his legacy.   I agree with your other points tho"

Why isn't Lebron James in the hall of fame?
"Carmelo Anthony averaged   21 points   6.1 rebounds   2.8 assists and   1.2 steals per game in his rookie season. Turned a **17-65 (14th in the west)** Denver team to a **43-39 8th seed**. *wasn't an all star*    Lebron James averaged   20.9 points   5.5 rebounds   5.9 assists and   1.2 steals per game   in his rookie season. Turned a **17-65 (15th in the east)** Cleveland team to a **35-47 (9th in the east)**. *wasn't an all star*    There are more examples. My point is, I seriously don't want a rookie playing in the all-star game. Simmons has a long (hopefully) career ahead of him. He'll be a constant face in future all-star games. However, players like Lou Williams, Goran Dragic will probably have this year only as their chance to get into the all-star game. And both of those player's team have a better record than Simmons' 76ers."

Yes. Of course there is. Why would Lebron fucking James take a 95% paycut? Do you really think its because of honor? After the stunt he pulled joining your team? Come on dude.
It was absolutely ridiculous. I swear there is no rational discussion about Lonzo. He's either the messiah that's going to lure Lebron James to LA or he's the biggest bust since Greg Oden.
"I already addressed this bud, there were no two other all stars on the Cavs, only Lebron James https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_NBA_All-Star_Game  Sorry I forgot to mention that their what 6th or 7th best player was out due to injury, or that one of their players was suspended on their own accord.."
"I do agree that pretty much know one of only 2 or 3 teams is going to win ever year is bad for the game and I the way it is now is a bit frustrating. I just hate the narrative that everyone should tank to get picks draft a LeBron James and then maybe have a small chance at winning, cause there's a little more to it than that."
"Here's how it would work:  Clippers tank this year. Their lottery spot lands them in the 10-14 range. They get really luck and win the lottery, jumping up to #1 overall.  They use the Detroit pick to dump enough salary to clear up cap space to sign Lebron James using cap space.  Next, they use future picks and salary to do a S&amp;T for Paul George  Then, they trade the #1 pick along with Danillo Galanari for a star player.  "
"Actual title: ""Even a king’s ransom would not be enough to lure LeBron James to Clippers""  Good clickbait title though, OP."
"The 60 win Hawks were a good team, but they lacked a superstar and got derailed by injuries prior to the Cleveland series. But let's not sit here and act like that Cleveland team was a joke. Mo Williams was putting up the same numbers in Milwaukee before he was traded to Cleveland. And Jamison was LITERALLY an all star the year before he joined the Cavs and was a 21 ppg scorer. Varejao was an all NBA level defender and continued to be after LeBron left until he died from injuries. Anthony Parker was an elite shooter in Toronto prior to joining Cleveland. And Delonte was a very good 6th man before he went insane. And he put up the same per36 numbers his entire career no matter the team.  And let's not forget that the NBA was nowhere NEAR as stacked back then. i.e. Who was Dirk's 2nd option in 2011? Jason Terry?

"What?? Did you just literally make that all up? Lebrons TOV% is almost identical to Hardens. Lebron has a higher ORB%, DRB%, TRB% and BLK%. Not to mention a higher pure FG% and 3pt% per game/average (all while playing more games making it even harder). If you go by your above WS/48, RPM, BPM, hell even DRPM or OBPM Anthony Davis isn’t in the top 10 on any of those stats in the league and not anywhere near Harden. He’s still amazing though. So not sure that helps your case since you used those as key stats for Harden then say Anthony Davis is the runner-up? Maybe Harden and Davis should be because they are beasts, but using what you said above makes no sense. As far as Clevelands point differential, the Raptors have almost the same differential as the Rockets and we have more wins over the Raptors than they do us this season.   **Edit-** Can downvote me, but everything above is facts with proof below. His statement makes no sense saying to use those stats then say Davis is runner-up, makes his Harden point irrelevant. Davis is amazing so maybe he should be, but if you use those stats like he suggested It wouldn’t make sense in comparison to Harden. In fact, if you use WS/48 and BPM Andre Ingram and James Harden are about even (see links below).   http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/RPM  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018_advanced.html"
"Alright fine, I'll entertain your arguments and pick them apart.  &gt; Yes. And 40% is still great. 30% still isnt.  You brought up the media saying he was becoming a LETHAL threat from 3, find me a godamn source cause I don't remember anyone talking about his elite 3 point shooting that season because no one could guard him on the inside. They talked about his IMPROVEMENT to 33% from 27% the year before, which is a huge improvement, and spoke of how if he could consistently shoot 33% he would be dominant because at 33% for a slasher of his caliber his shot would have to be respected statistically at 1 pt per possession and he would have more space to attack the basket or drive and kick. Maybe you don't understand that too much cause it is a little bit more nuanced than a normal fan would realize, and I was trying to bring up the fact that a 40% shooter was considered godly, not just solid like in today's league. 33% was considered good in 2011.  &gt; Again. Not what I said. Don't be mad bc I called you out on your dumb fuck Bogans point.  Yeah that's so weird that you're saying ""that's not what I said"" about the stats thing because you LITERALLY wrote: ""Lebron James was better that year. All of the advanced and regular stats support it.""  Do you realize what you wrote? You wrote X player is better than Y and the stats support it. You don't offer ANY other reason, except stats. How do you think someone is going to take a comment like that? That you DON'T think the stats are the reason why? You gave no other reason for your opinion other than ""that's what I think"" and ""stats support my opinion""...  &gt; I thought he should of won it while watching the season unfold.  Well, Lebron would disagree with you and Chris Bosh would disagree with you.  ""Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he's done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get."" -Bosh  ""It's Derrick Rose definitely. He's the leader. What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He's playing some unbelievable basketball."" - Lebron  If you need any more convincing that your opinion doesn't hold much merit, feel free to read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/24v9de/kevin_durant_officially_named_mvp_got_119_of_a/chb1dcb/  It is the quintessential eat crow comment in response to ""Lebron should have won it over Rose"". It explains Rose's team dynamic showing how short handed they really were, and compares it to how good Lebron's support cast was playing. Also, it doesn't compare it to how poorly lebron was performing that year compared to the three years prior."
Be honest - you gonna go back to sporting that Lakers flair when they sign Paul George and Lebron James this offseason?
My favorite thing about dirk is how you just know he believes in his heart of hearts that he’s better than lebron james
"I truly think this argument for mvp is really dumb. I would say james harden has contributed a lot more to winning basketball this season than lebron.  Lebron had that bad stretch that pretty much ruled him out. He has had great performances but harden has been better.  Harden also has the better team record. And no, mentioning westbrook is not valid because he had a historic season with the triple doubles that we probably wont see for a while"
"no shit, Ben is the one who went on ESPN and made those comments in the first place. Donny Mitchell's mantra is literally ""be humble"" and his demeanor backs it up.   Not saying what Ben did is bad in any way, if anything it spices things up and is a great mentality to have if you want to be an elite player in this league. But it has it's ramifications, one of which is a massive amount of haters, much akin to Lebron James in his early years. I swear most of you sixers fans need to lighten up a little bit lol. I've been fucking with your subreddit for a while but lately ya'll have gotten a bit too butthurt over this whole ROTY race."
"Ok but people think it's good. If they thought it was shitty and it tasted shitty they wouldn't go there.   And the value of the education and free ride is immaterial. Other pro leagues don't pay their players with free room. The ncaa makes just as much money as many pro leagues. They are getting a steal not paying the kids. How is that fair or legal?  And like I said, the ncaa is the best option right now. They don't have a union wjere they can negotiate something better so they're powerless.   And LeBron James was 18 he signed his first million dollar contract. The top ncaa athletes today are worth that much to the nba, and they're playing for free "
Neither team was 100% healthy and one team has a Lebron James while the other does not. So no
"It amazes me how everyone paraphrases this interview, but somehow his answer slightly more dickish each time.    When they asked if any other rookies ""caught his attention"",  he shook his head and said “I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That’s where I want to be. I think for me, that’s what I love to watch.”  Him saying he doesn't follow other rookies and only watches superstars is a lot different than dogging the other rookies.  "
"Seriously dude, introspection. Read the damn quote. Simmons was asked if any other rookies had caught his attention. He said none had. **he never mentioned Mitchell, nor any other rookie.** All he said is that he watches the greats, not other rookies.  People made it into a diss at Mitchell because Mitchell is the 2nd best rookie this year, but Ben Simmons didn’t say a single damn thing about Mitchell.  For someone who has literally no idea what you’re talking about, you’re really full of yourself. Can you be a big enough person to admit you were wrong, or are you going to continue obliviously insulting me like I’m the one out of my depth?  “None,” Simmons responded promptly. “I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That’s where I want to be. I think for me, that’s what I love to watch.”"
"Ben's comments were taken out of context.  EDI: This is the full quote (same thing he said before the season):  ""None,"" Simmons told ESPN. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch."""
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Alec Peters.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 10 or 11years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years . So you never watched Alec Peters in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Alec's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the  greatest PF ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Alec Peters, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Alec  in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Alec is better.  You might be jealous of Alec's hair, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Suns fan who watched basketball in the 2017-18 tank war, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Alec isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Lebron James  The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Alec  talk to the adults. Fair?"
"TBF so did every Heat fan at the time. Nobody believed Spo could handle that team. Esoecially after the first season finals loss to the Mavs.   I appreciate Spo now but I wanted him gone pretty much the entire time Lebron was here.  I commend Pat though for not giving in to Lebrons demand and sticking with his guy.   Big part of the reason Lebron left was because Pat didnt let him run the team. He banned his entourage from having free reign of the arena and practice facilities, team plane. He pursued players Lebrom wanted but thats prettt much as far as it went.   Lebron is an excelent athlete and basketball player but a very spoiled person. You cant really blame him, theyve been calling him King James since he was like 14. But i am resentful he gave up on the heat and possibly the greatest team of all time for pettiness.(blah blah coming home narrative, but he wouldnt have left if he was LeGM in Miami). I am especially resentful for the WAY he left and set us up for failure by waiting for Wade to opt out of his contract and the last minute to announce.   "
"like i said, that is not how the game is played anymore. almost every team in the league has their ball handlers grabbing these uncontested rebounds   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/22/16809866/nba-triple-double-boom-russell-westbrook  ""Teams have never been more cognizant of transition defense than they are today, which means an emphasis on setting up on defense before the opponent can exploit any gaps. This, in turn, leaves plenty of defensive rebounds to be had completely uncontested. Enter Westbrook, James Harden, Ben Simmons, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and, yes, Chris Paul. In a league that’s playing the fastest it’s played in over a quarter century, every split second counts. Having the rebound go to your lead ball handler is not only effective, it will soon be the norm, if we haven’t already gotten to that point.""  "
"We took em to 6 in 2016 when they had Lebron James, and this cavs team as a whole is worse than their team in 2016, and we are much better this season than we were in 2016. Plus we will have HCA vs them this year which we didn't have versus them in the past, and we are 34-7 at home this year.  We may not be the favourites, but we do have a good shot against them  "
"Don is electric and he's a pure scorer.  He's going to be extremely legit.  This race was never close though.  Ben Simmons is so much more than a pure scorer.  He scores on slightly better efficiency, facilitates exponentially better and is an exponentially better defender.    Saying there really isn't a close second to Simmons should stop offending Don fans.  It's not offensive.  Simmons has Lebron James potential.  It's just unlucky for the Spider."
LeBron James
"Warriors Blazers game was fun, despite the loss.  Gary Harris game winners  Kevin Garnett reacting to contortionists on Area 21  Kobe Shaq sit down  The new and improved All Star game  YA YA HEY!  Biased but I love seeing Quinn Cook ball out these last few games  Wade blocking LeBron  LeBron's crazy behind the back, between the legs pass  James Harden lethal stepback  Hawks subreddit  Thunder Nuggets 2/OT game  ""The West is a swamp, and only the real alligators gonna make it out""  Seeing Dirk, Vince, Jason Terry, and Manu still balling out  Lonzo and Kuzma bromance  Jingles  &amp;nbsp;  This is the first season that I've been active on this subreddit so honestly just being here and getting to interact with all of you guys has been the best part. I spend far too much time on this site lol but I love it. Thank you for all the laughs."
"But LeBron James isn't a guard, remember?"
"Your arguments aren't bad, but the original scenario is two max contracts for Jordan and B Jordan.  All I'm saying is that with zone defense one Jordan isn't as good as both LeBron James and Kevin Durant combined, or really any other pairing of two max contract superstars.  Like whatever you run with MJ + 4 role players could be better run with LBJ + KD + 3 role players."
"Feel like Kyrie didn't want to constantly be sonned by a guy a few years older than him. He also didn't want to play on a team where Lebron gets all the accolades even tho he was the dude who hit the game winning shot in Curry's face that got them that chip.    I mean it could be fairly said that Lebron is responsible for creating that environment at least (which he was partially justified in doing so, being the best player in the world and all) however it cost him the second best player on the team. If he had tried to include Kyrie or stopped trying to ""take him under his wing"" and just respected him as the other superstar on the team maybe Kyrie would've felt respected enough to stay and have Bron's back. But we know why he didn't want to stay. He felt disrespected and he felt like everything was just the Lebron James show (which it was with Bron generally getting preferential treatment in all issues).   And you can say that he didn't want to be under a shadow but even that's not truly accurate bc it's not like he's really *the man* in Boston. They play a well coached style of basketball that encourages ball movement and everyone being a part of the play. It's not hero ball. He wanted to play under a proper system amongst proper comrades that he got respect from and respected back. He wanted to play for a team. He didn't want to play for Lebron.  Actually goes back to a convo the sub had earlier this year where we talked about why certain players could get annoyed playing with Lebron as he basically tells you what to do all game (which for role players makes the game a hell of a lot easier). I could see it rubbing more established guys like Kyrie or IT (mainly his ego tbh) wrong. Not a knock on Lebron at all. I think it's admirable for him to coach on the floor in real time. Shows how fucking smart he is on the floor.   And also on your other point, before I forget, yes it's pretty damn impressive that despite losing Kyrie and going through the train wreck of the trade deadline fiasco that they're still going to finish near the same record. Just goes to show how dominant/effective Lebron is. "
Lebron James and Delonte West
"Yeah it's pretty nuts seeing who all Simmons matches up with every game.The key is he doesnt just switch; he can be hte primary matchup defender on any position in the NBA.    http://stats.nba.com/team/1610612755/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense&amp;CF=DEF_PLAYER_NAME*E*Simmons  You can see from the link he has averaged at least 13 poss a game guarding each of the following: Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Eric Bledsoe, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook. Really anybody any time.   The most versatile defender in the NBA this year really comes down to 3 guys to me looking at the data: Ben Simmons, Jeff Green(yes that Jeff Green) and Justise Winslow    http://stats.nba.com/team/1610612739/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense&amp;CF=DEF_PLAYER_NAME*E*Green  Green not only guards the John Wall types but also spends more time on the true Centers the Jusuf Nurkic or DeAndre Jordan types than Simmons did.   http://stats.nba.com/team/1610612748/matchups/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Defense&amp;CF=DEF_PLAYER_NAME*E*Winslow  Winslow is also just absurd. Spends about equal amount of time on the Kemba Walkers of the world as hte Karl Anthony Town's of the world.   This type of versatility these guys have is way way rarer than people think. The guys you would think would spend this much time guarding 1-5 in the reg sesaon like Giannis LeBron Draymond etc dont really to nearly this degree. "

"yea but nobody was giving harden the mvp because of triple doubles, his mvp case was based off being on one of the best teams in the league all while not being gregg popovich, lebron james or the team with 4 all stars. it doesnt matter than harden was getting rebounds at a similar rate to westbrook. don't falsely equate the two situations. "
Cavs without LeBron any year  'Dipo is amazing he is the best defender on that team by a mile and the best offensive player. And he sets the bar with effort and hustle plays which is my biggest problem with James Harden. I know if I was his teammate I would not want to bust my ass while he catches his breath so he can pad his stats on the other end
"I lowkey want to see a Lebron vs Harden finals. Lebron defending Harden in the 4th, both James trying to cement their MVP cases. It would be glorious "
"Even though Lebron james has played more games and scored more total points his team is still worse than Harden's team. If you want me to cherrypick shit I can too. Lebron misses more FTs, misses more clutch FTs (worst clutch FT performance of the last 20 years), has fewer points per game, still is hardly more efficient despite having a lower volume, and only has more assists because he plays more minutes.  &gt;He’s got a smaller role on a better team sure.  LOL. How are you gonna say Harden only looks good because his usage is higher and then say he has a smaller role?  The Rockets are much better team and Harden is playing better, no amount of you being delusional will make Lebron the leader."
THIS JUST IN: LEBRON JAMES IS GOOD
LeBron James and Ben Wallace played together during his first Cavs stretch. 
Lebron James and Kyrie for me. 
I agree that LeBron is the most valuable player in the league but James harden is my mvp this season.  IDK what mvp means anymore 
"Ah yes, LeBron James, Anthony Tolliver, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Langston Galloway   The best long range sharpshooters in the league."
"LeBron James didn't go to college yet won ROY against players that ""earned it"" by going to college for one to five years. How is that fair?"
"Well the Raptors will never beat LeBron at his best, so you'd think any true Raptors fan would be just fine with James playing below his standards."
"I know that they take into account having the highest record, but I disagree with that metric.  Which is part of the reason I think LBJ deserved it over Rose.    Also keith bogans started every game but was their 3rd most played SG.  Thats some really cherry picking shit to point out considering both Kyle Korver and Ronny Brewer played more minutes and put up more points.  Odd you'd try to convince people that Bogans was their only scoring option besides Rose, and not even bring up the guys that played more minutes and scored more than him *at the same position*.  Look at whatever you want, that bulls team was a very good team and it was by no means JUST Rose making it so.  Lebron James was better that year.  All of the advanced and regular stats support it.  It was a media led narrative, and you could see it coming as soon as they started *constantly* jacking Rose off saying how hes become a lethal 3 point threat bc he got his percentage to barely above 30."
If Ben Simmons isn’t considered a rookie because he has been around the league for an extra year and got professional training during that year. Then Lebron James Jr wont be a ROY candidate. He has been around it his whole life and will get training from his dad and other trainers that help Lebron. Simmons is a rookie by the definition of rookie. “A player playing his first season on a team”. So ROY is Bens. DM had a great year though. No doubt is clear cut second. Simmons was just better so far. 
Twenty years from now people will drop their jaw that Shaquille O'Neal and Lebron James played on the same team without reaching the finals.  
"While Doncic does not have elite NBA level athleticism, he is still fairly athletic for his position.  Not everyone can have Lebron/Westbrook/Giannis type athleticism, but can still be an elite NBA player. It's his playmaking, feeling for the game and production at young age that makes him special. Remember, the scouting report on James Harden going into the draft was that he had marginal quickness and leaping ability and was considered undersized."

"Cavs make it to the finals they put this dude in and get out stats Lebron in all 4 games and wins finals MVP. Lebron uninvites him to his birthday party and after the 2018 Finals after being disrespected by some random in the G League, Leborn James quits the NBA and becomes a Walmart store manager."
"Booker is also only the 4th player ever to average 24/4/4 at his age (21). The others are Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Tracy McGrady.  "
"&gt;- LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Carmelo Anthony weren't in the league  I thought those 3 were rookies in 03/04 when KG won his MVP dragging his Timberwolves kicking and screaming to the Conference Finals"
"&gt; - LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Carmelo Anthony weren't in the league  This is not true.  The last time the Timberwolves were in the playoffs, those three players were rookies.

LeBron James Jr.
LeBron James jr. for your second question  Obviously not in the top 5 tho
"&gt;I would have tried to not allow him to jump. It looks so easy from OP's video   LOL you naive ass fool. Spoken like an imbecile on the internet who doesn't understand the difference between normal humans, and professional NBA athletes. It looks so easy because LeBron James is doing this shit, and it's nothing for him. Dude can dunk like this in his sleep  &gt;   You do know that NBA athletes are far superior genetically than normal people right? LeBron James is an even superior creature. Dude's 6'9 260lbs of pure muscle, with a 41+ inch vertical. Bron is the only player in history who's super strong yet super fast. Black Panther-esque..   &gt;  You wouldn't have ""allowed"" him to jump?  LOL big ass NBA athletes can't stop him, you think you ordinary ass normal sized human would have made any difference? Bron would have carried you on his back and then dunk the ball. He most likely carries more weight in training than your whole body weight, unless you are one fat nugget. Forget LeBron, 98% of any NBA athlete can overpower you in their sleep, don't fool yourself   &gt;      &gt;   Ignorance, stupidity, especially naivety,  these shit will get you fucked hard IRL some day.. Ya living in a false delusional bubble, but reality is quite different. Stop embarrassing yourself kid, wake the fuck up"
"Oh no, the Cavs are only going to have a top 8 pick in the draft to put alongside Lebron James!!! What ever will they do with such a terrible selection!?! "
Here's mine:  * MVP: LeBron James  * 6MOTY: Jordan Clarkson  * COTY: LeBron James  * ROTY: Cedi Osman  * EOTY: Koby Altman  * All NBA first team: Hill-Smith-LeBron-Green-Love  * All NBA second team: Calderon-Clarkson-Korver-Hood-Zizic  * All NBA third team: Perrantes-Holland-Osman-White-Perkins  Haters will say I'm biased.  
"But we are talking about the Most Valuable Player. I understand Harden is insanely talented and Houston is a WAY better team than the Cavs right now, but LeBron James is still the better player. "
"wins is what makes an MVP. MOST VALUABLE PLAYER to their team, curry was more valuable to that gsw team in 2015, lebron is lightyears more valuable to his team than harden will ever be. it's my opinion. don't let it get u upset  edit: james harden is gonna win it, but lebron is beyond more valuable."
Who cares if he's the God of the trash pile. Fuck James Harden led a worse team in 2015 to more wins than LeBron is getting now
Lebron James is the best at his position while Kevin Love and TT are the worst lol
Lebron James has been the best player in the nba all season. 
#LEBRON JAMES IS THE GOAT. NONE OF YOU CAN DISAGREE BECAUSE YOU CANT SEE THIS.   #ALSO FREEJAH
"You should re-read the article.  They didn't ask which rookies whose accomplishments he was ""aware of"".  They asked which rookies caught his attention.    ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  Hes clearly not watching other rookies.  Hes watching the league's best players."
LeBron James
"tbh, not a lebron james fan whatsoever.. but lebron deserves it almost every season. he is the most valuable team to his team by miles and miles. they would literally be nothing without him.. even in the east"
"TL;DR: USA Today's MVP voters make their cases for their choice.  Sam Amick plans to vote for James Harden, while Jeff Zillgitt plans to vote for LeBron James."
Lebron James is still the best player in the league in 2021
"In 2013, lebron james had 2 rings and a 2/4 record in the finals. Jordan has 6 rings on 6/6 thats a huge difference"
LeBron James has surpassed Jordan.   It may be unpopular but he surpassed him in 2013 for me honestly 
"I would argue that while Vince had many spectacular dunks, players like MJ, Lebron, or even Deandre Jordan utilize dunking in a much better way in game.   Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain are both better scorers from stats alone. MJ could score anywhere on the court, and special rules had to be made to combat the ways his opponents could find to stop him. Wilt didnt have as much dimension or variety to his scoring, but the man was unstoppable regardless.  The DPOY race will be so congested with young stars like gobert and embiid. I dont think someone like isaac can manage to steal one from them  Very few players have averaged 10 assists per game, and I simply dont believe jokic can join that elite tier. If we look at great non-guard passers like Lebron james, even he never managed to do it"
"You're actually correct, LeBron James has lost 73 of his 217 playoff games while the Toronto Raptors have played in 72 playoff games total, losing 44."
LeBron James
"....... Sure.   Lebron James beat the ""best team of all time"" when that team missed their starting center for half the series, best defender for one game, their best perimeter player was injured in early game 6, AND their best player was clearly injured.   Yes, Lebron most certainly beat the best team in the world, no question.   How much of a stan do you have to be?"
You guys got a good squad this year. Maybe he gets dethroned. I’m going with my best gambling advice here though. “Don’t bet against LeBron James.”
"Westbrook scoring 2500 points last year is nuts. Also, never thought I'd hear the phrase Lebron James joining Russell Westbrook for a record."
The fuck?  Mitchell is on the list but not the ROY Simmons or even the possible GOAT LeBron James? 
"&gt;》I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch  I get that. He wants to be where those guys are. BUT he still Said that no other rookies have caught his eye. Zero % chance he hasn't noticed donovan and what he is doing "
"I don't know what argument you're trying to make with the first one still. It's not some secret that MVP normally goes to a team with the better record, or at least a top 2 conference record. Harden's on the better team, historically that increases his MVP odds, especially because without them he still has been the more impactful regular season player than James.  I keep ""dancing around the question"" because it's a stupid one. Harden has played 73 games, the expected amount for a full season, and enough for his team to clinch the first seed. No more was needed from him for the season. As I said, MVP isn't about the total number of quality games a player participates in, which is the basis for your argument. Furthermore, even if we were, for some reason, to accept your logic, Lebron's bad stretch in January went over a more prolonged period than Harden's absences due to injury. Therefore, if we do equate a bad game from Lebron with an absence from Harden, though there's a case Lebron hurt his team in that stretch, Harden still has the edge.  You say Lebron has been slightly better, but don't back it up with anything substantial.  Harden will win MVP and he deserves it. I'm not going to go around in circles anymore, so I won't bother answering the next one."
"&gt; Last year was an anomaly largely driven by Westbrook's historic season. The ""gap"" between Russell and Harden last year does not equal the gap between James and Harden.  This is incorrect. Harden's individual numbers are virtually identical to his numbers last year meanwhile LeBron's individual numbers are better than Russell's were last year. It is also important to note that the first person to average a triple double (Oscar) did not win MVP that season.  &gt; Furthermore, MVP has never been an award about total number of ""good games"" a player provides for his team.   You keep dancing around the question: would you feel better about LeBron's MVP case if he twisted his ankle and missed all of January?  &gt; even if you discount January, Harden has been better.  No this is incorrect. If you discount January, they have been virtually identical (LeBron has actually been slightly better).   "

"&gt;There was no demand for Blatt because Lebron blackballed him. Blatt couldn't get a job because his locker room reputation was tarnished by Lebron who's opinion holds a lot of weight around the league.   you really couldn't be more wrong, the entire team had issues with Blatt...   [Lou Amundson \(played with Cavs during Blatts tenure\):](https://nypost.com/2016/01/23/nothing-about-the-cavs-mess-was-surprising-to-knicks-center/)   &gt; “It’s hard for a rookie coach to come in and be in a situation like that where one guy [James] is such a big influence on a whole organization,’’ Amundson said. “That’s a tough position to be in. However, you need in that situation to be assertive and make sure your players know you’re going to hold them accountable, every one of them, and they’re going to respect you. In the NBA, coaching is more managing than coaching.  &gt; “It’s important to just be assertive and not let that happen. Hold everybody accountable, otherwise you lose respect and attention of your guys.’’   [Haywood \(played with Cavs during Blatt tenure\):](http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2016/01/22/haywood-blatt-couldnt-help-team-scared-of-lebron-lost-cavs-respect/) &gt; “Coach Blatt was very hesitant to challenge LeBron James,” Haywood said. “It was one of those situations where, being a rookie coach, and LeBron being bigger than life, it was a little too much for him. I remember we had James Jones [talk] to Coach about how, ‘Hey, you can’t just skip over when LeBron James makes a mistake in the film room.’ Because we all see it.  &gt;“And we’re like, ‘Hey, you didn’t say anything about that. You’re going to correct when Matthew Dellavedova‘s not in the right spot. You’re going to say something when Tristan Thompson‘s not in the right spot. Well, we see a fast break and LeBron didn’t get back on defense or there’s a rotation and he’s supposed to be there, and you just keep rolling the film and the whole room is quiet.’ We see that as players. That’s when … as a player, you start to lose respect for a coach.  &gt; “Slowly but surely, that respect started chipping away where he would kind of be scared to correct LeBron in film sessions. When he would call every foul for LeBron in practice. Those type of things add up. Guys are like, ‘C’mon man, are you scared of him?’ ”  &gt; “I remember last year telling somebody on the team, ‘I love David Blatt. But if we’re in a close game, he can’t help us,’ ” Haywood said on Sirius XM. “That’s not a shot at Blatt. But … David Blatt can’t come to a huddle and draw up a play that would get us a good shot. David Blatt doesn’t understand sometimes substitution patterns.  &gt; “The mistake he made against the Bulls when he didn’t have the ball in LeBron’s hands at the end of the game… There were obvious mistakes he was making, and you start to see it as a player, where ‘We’re going to have to win this on our own, because he can’t do for us what Gregg Popovich can do for the Spurs. He can’t take advantage of a mismatch the way Steve Kerr did in the NBA Finals – Steve Kerr made it so it was hard for us to play James Jones. They attacked him every time he was in the game.”  &gt; “Blatt didn’t feel the game like that, and those mistakes can get you beat. When the goal is championship or bust and you don’t think that coach can get you to a championship or help you win a championship, then that’s what has to be done.  &gt; “I honestly think they’re a better team. I have no ill will toward David, I hope he gets another job. But as a guy who was there last year, I think Tyronn Lue will do a better job.”  [heres some more from cleveland.com:](http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2016/01/why_david_blatt_got_fired_and.html)   &gt;During team scrimmages, players competed aggressively but bit their tongues as Blatt frequently blew his whistle to call ticky-tack or phantom fouls for his go-to players. One player said sometimes Blatt didn't even have a whistle and would yell at the top of his lungs to stop play and call a foul if one of his stars acted as if he was hit.  &gt; It was viewed as a blatant attempt to get in the good graces of his top talent. Blatt's leadership was in question. Players grew tired of this treatment. The locker room started resenting Blatt's handling, or lack thereof, when it came to dealing with his stars.  &gt; Word circulated to cleveland.com that Blatt had trouble drawing up plays out of timeouts. He would freeze up and waste precious seconds, one player said. He would even draw up plays for players who weren't in the game, another player said.  &gt; Blatt didn't have the necessary relationship with his guys to get players to buy in. Lue is expected to hold players accountable. He's not afraid to give James a piece of his mind. Players from 1 down to 15 will be held responsible.   "
This sub is going to melt down when they realize that outside of stEph and lebron every other star player is irrelevant in pop culture. James harden to the masses is the black guy with the big beard who plays basketball.

"No I'm not. James Harden's team has had very little turnover and has missed quite a few games. His numbers aren't better than Lebron's, and his team would still be great with CP3 and shooters. The Cavs would be absolutely awful without Lebron and despite an awful January slump with IT they're still the 3 seed.   Lebron is the most valuable player."

Uhm two words: Lebron James
Defensive Juggernaut.  2008 Champion.  2010 Finalist.  2012 Finalist.  What better way to honour the Celtics 10th year anniversary of their 2008 title by helping Celtics legend Lebron James win yet another title.
"I think you have to be arrogant to be an elite athlete. You have to believe you're the best. That said, compared to most personalities (Kobe etc.) he comes across as pretty humble. It's a bit different from when he was younger and said stuff like ""no Lebron James team is a desperate team."" He gives great praise to guys like Durant, Curry, mentioned how good the Sixers were long before their current streak, etc.  I remember when he blocked Curry's shot in 2016 he started trash talking him a little bit. He does that so rarely it really stood out."
With how much LeBron cares about New York and being the king of it I’d think he’d want to play here and then fantasize about the day he joins Porzingis while Frank Sinatra plays from all the speakers in New York.  Then I remember that James Dolan exists and I want to die all over again.
What a fucking amazing passer this LeBron James guy is!
"LeBron James is much 💪 better than Michael Jordan for a few reasons.   The first reason being longevity, Michael Jordan would have never 🙅‍♂️ been able to compete at this insanely dominant level for as many years (15!) as the king 👑 has!   The second reason being passing, the king 👑 is known for being so unselfish 🙆‍♂️ and making everyone around him better📈. He is a top 🔝 5 passer in basketball history while Jordan was a selfish ball hog🐷, he was never as unselfish as LeBron.   The third reason being his pure dominance. Michael Jordan had to take a break 💔 from basketball because he felt that it wasn’t his year and that he doesn’t want to look weak 😭😭 Jordan also was exhausted while LeBron has led his team to the finals for 7 years🤫🤫, and soon 🔜 to be 5 more!!😴😴  The fourth reason being his shooting 🌠. LeBron developed a good three point 👇 shot 😈 and was then able to score 💯 from anywhere while Jordan was basically DeRozan on that end, except with decent post moves. 🤭  The fifth reason being that LeBron never🙅‍♀️ had the talent that Michael Jordan had for his 6 titles. Jordan was a perennial first round exit 😂😂😂 while LeBron was able to lift his💩 team to a finals appearance when he was 22🤭🤭🤭🤭 Only GOATs 🐐can do that. LeBron also has efficiency, niceness, strength, rebounding, and defensive versatility. King 👑 will soon be the first 🥇 member of the 40k/10k/10k club 💪💪 and there is nothing Mike can do about it 😳😳! He needs to stop ❌ disrespecting Bron by saying Kobe is better because that just proves he can’t handle that LeBron took his throne.🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️"
"That's because you keep ignoring the literal point of my comment which, to recap, was:  **Your original link does not include shots to tie** (which is precisely what LeBron fails to do when it comes to his Free Throw shooting ills).   On the other hand, if you put LeBron James in the most dire situations wherein he has to tie the game in an extremely pressure packed situation (playoffs)?   Uh, he freaking sucks.  Apologies.  &gt; Anyway, I don't know how you managed to fuck up clicking buttons on a website but great job sport. I'm not currently smoking anything, but still seem to be able to operate a fucking website properly.  Indeed, it's like you're having a stroke and repeating similar ad hominem nonsense over and over again.  You're coming close to needing to be admitted.  &gt;  You have no idea what the fuck you are talking about, and seem to lack basic competency. Maybe you should figure out how to use a simple website before sharing your uninformed and absurd opinions.  At the very least, you're really demonstrating an eloquence heretofore unmatched with your use of three F words.  Your use of them totally proves your point.  Totally.  Though if you want to curse, you should do it at LeBron after he inevitably bricks yet another shot to tie in the playoffs.  Edit:  You know what, we're BOTH wrong in what we're searching based on what we're saying.  See below.  However, I concede it actually kind of bolsters your point in a sense.  LeBron is MUCH better at winning games when down 1 or 2 (and taking a 2 or 3 to win).  But he is TERRIBLE at tying them when down a maximum amount and has no chance at winning them (so down 2 or 3 and taking a 2 or 3).  So he is both clutch by your definition (and it's not an unfair one) and not clutch by mine (and I'd argue it's not exactly unfair to say that he sucks when it's most dire).  LeBron James, when behind (so not tied) to take a lead or tie the game in the playoffs:  [9/21 (42.8%)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=play&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;q4=Y&amp;q5=Y&amp;time_remain_minutes=12&amp;time_remain_seconds=0&amp;time_remain_comp=le&amp;margin_min=-6&amp;margin_max=-1&amp;is_tying=Y&amp;is_go_ahead=Y&amp;player_id=bryanko01&amp;order_by=fg)  Kobe Bryant, same stats: [29/98 (29.5%)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=play&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;q4=Y&amp;q5=Y&amp;time_remain_minutes=12&amp;time_remain_seconds=0&amp;time_remain_comp=le&amp;margin_min=-6&amp;margin_max=-1&amp;is_tying=Y&amp;is_go_ahead=Y&amp;player_id=bryanko01&amp;order_by=fg)  Steph Curry: [3/8 (37.5%)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=play&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;q4=Y&amp;q5=Y&amp;time_remain_minutes=12&amp;time_remain_seconds=0&amp;time_remain_comp=le&amp;margin_min=-6&amp;margin_max=-1&amp;is_tying=Y&amp;is_go_ahead=Y&amp;player_id=bryanko01&amp;order_by=fg)  So to recap, to tie the game when coming from behind, LeBron is 2/9 (which is pretty shitty).

How about to tie the game (which again, *is not included in your original link demonstrating ""clutchness""*) in a high stakes game like the postseason in the final minute of the 4th or OT?

It's exactly as I'd have thought -- LeBron mentally goes AWOL when the situation is the most dire, which is precisely the reason why clutch FT's (for which, if one is behind, definitionally one must ""make to tie"") are so difficult for him.  As an aside, I'll throw you a (small) bone: for the postseason stats above, Kevin Durant is 1/8 (so he's even worse).  But I would have *suspected he was mentally weak in that scenario as well*."
"Carmelo ""Lebron James"" Anthony"

Not as funnie as Lebron James!
"Kyrie is an amazing player, I think all this shows is that Brad Stevens / Danny ainge are great at their jobs. Kyrie May be slightly overrated having played with lebron James and what I think is at least a top 2 coach in basketball. For example if kyrie had been traded to the suns, he would most likely average 30 + a game but I couldn’t see them making the playoffs. Put top 5 nba talent like lebron kd kawaii or whoever and they would sneak in at least. Don’t want to take away from kyrie cuz I think he’s amazing, just my thoughts. "

I will take this opportunity to remind everyone that the only reason Windhorst has a job is because of one LeBron Raymone James.
Just because a statistic gets put up that doesn’t show Lebron as the best does not make it a shit on Lebron James thread.   If we are gonna post every time he breaks any record nobody has heard of and discuss his greatness then it should be okay to post a stat that he doesn’t measure up on and discuss what it entails.

"LeBron could guard 1's just fine, Derrick Rose's MVP season:  &gt;Rose shot 6.3 percent from the floor in the series when defended by James, lowest among any player that defended him on five or more plays.   He was 1/15."
Until about five minutes ago I had no idea that Lebron James was actually terrible at basketball  I mean yesterday they were comparing him to Michael Jordan but after this game there's no debate\- he is the single worst player in the NBA and possibly the worst player to ever set foot on a basketball court
"I only see NBA since 2013, so i will do a starting lineup since that.   By personal taste:  Russell Westbrook, Khris Middleton, Klay Thompson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid  By quality:  Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Lebron James, Anthony Davis"
"i dont think boston gets the sweep. im seeing some foul trouble hurting them, and lebron james ascending. good post tho. "
"well no, i'd still take a healthy celtics over lebron + 6ers and actually do think maxing lebron at this point of his career is a bad idea, but i might be in the minority on that. but even then that's a fucking awful comparison, the nets were a bad team signing a bunch of over-the-hill stars while the sixers are a good and young team signing lebron fucking james who is still putting up GOAT-level production"
LeBron James is absolutely a scorer. 
"There was an article awhile back about how Lebron's memories were causing him problems in games until he learned to think around it.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11067098/lebron-james-greatest-weapon-brain  See excerpt below.  It's June 2013, and James is riding back to the team hotel after Game 3 of the NBA Finals in San Antonio, with the Spurs having crushed the Heat by 36 points to take a 2-1 series lead. James was 7-of-21 shooting this night and in the midst of a poor Finals performance. Over the first three games, he was shooting just 38 percent and averaging 16.6 points, stunningly low numbers after what has been inarguably the finest season of his career. On the bus, he turns and confides to a friend.  ""I'm thinking too much,"" James says, ""about 2007.""  It's 2007, and James has been humbled by the Spurs in a four-game sweep in the Finals. Coach Gregg Popovich has not respected the ability of the Cavs' 23-year-old phenom to shoot, no matter what James had done to the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals the week before. So Popovich backs his defense off, ordering his players to encircle the paint and make James prove he can execute from the outside.  He cannot. James shoots a miserable 36 percent in the series. His shaky jumper is unable to deliver under pressure. It's a crushing series for James, who looks like an undergrad who's arrived at a final exam for which he's forgotten to study. At the conclusion of Game 4, with the wound still fresh, James swears he will radically adjust his level of focus and his attention to detail.  And so he does. Over the course of the next six years, James becomes a vastly better shooter, statistically one of the finest in the game, before adding layers to his post game in the following years, racking up three more visits to the Finals, four Most Valuable Player trophies and a title ...  And still it is, in 2013, with Popovich returning to the exact same game plan from six years prior, that James is finding he isn't just battling the strategy, but rather the baggage of those long-ago missed jumpers. The memory does not forget. James is by now a completely different player, more mature, more polished and confident. But as he looks down at that Spurs defensive set, his head can't help it, the hard drive producing the files it has already downloaded without asking for permission first. The memory replays a string of prior decisions, all leading to a series of negative outcomes, one atop the other, locking him in stasis when he needs action, most of all.  ""At times his memory can be a bad thing,"" Spoelstra said. ""Because he remembers his failures, too.""  Consider what you know of the 2011 NBA Finals. And now consider it, instead, like this: In what will likely be remembered as the low point of his career, James is miserable for several games against the Dallas Mavericks -- including a vitally important Game 4 collapse when he somehow scores just eight points in 46 minutes. At times during that game it appears as if James is in a trance.  ""What is he thinking?"" the basketball world wonders.  James -- with two titles and counting, and four straight trips to the Finals -- can admit today what he's thinking in 2011: He's thinking of everything. Everything good, and everything bad. In 2011, he isn't just playing against the Mavs; he's also battling the demons of a year earlier, when he failed in a series against the Boston Celtics as the pressure of the moment beat him down. It's Game 5 of the 2010 Eastern Conference semifinals, and it is, to this point, perhaps the most incomprehensible game of James' career. His performance is so lockjawed, so devoid of rhythm, the world crafts its own narrative, buying into unfounded and ridiculous rumors because they seem more plausible than his performance.  James, though, never fully deals with any of that. Instead, he changes teams. Changes cities. Changes coaches. Changes owners. Changes teammates. Changes uniforms. Changes climate. Wipe the slate clean, and maybe, for once, he can leave the past behind.  Instead, when it all happens again a year later, James' recall turns against him, yet again, like an awful sequel to an awful original movie -- everything happening out of James' control, the awful computer in his head winning the inner monologue.  ""There are a lot of things that go through my mind during a game,"" James says. ""Sometimes I cloud my mind too much. I get to thinking about the game too much instead of just playing."""

# 1 - Lebron James
Refs.   Somebody will breathe in near vicinity of LeBron James and a foul will be called.  Tony Bros. are coming.
"I feel that Lebron instigated the altercation and later twisted it to his advantage in a series he knew he couldn't win fairly, yes.http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16116188/after-lebron-james-draymond-green-altercation-james-upset-green-suspended"
"I guess there's no proof as such, I just know Bron has a huge amount of influence with the league and I gathered from the postgame interviews that he was pushing to have the play reviewed. [Here is a good article from while the whole thing was unfolding.](http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16116188/after-lebron-james-draymond-green-altercation-james-upset-green-suspended) In my view Lebron was the instigator and he shaped the narrative to his advantage after the fact... but I am a Warriors fan."

ill tell you this: Lebron has 30% of his 2pt field goal attempts assisted and 35% of his 3pt attempts assisted.   You know what that figure for Russ is? 17% and 5.5%. James harden is literally 1 percent and 26%. Thats a huge fuckin difference.   Do a quick search on BBall ref before you start spewing shit out of your mouth. 
"No, didn't you hear? LeBron James is actually the smartest man on Earth. "
"There won't be. The only argument you will hear is, LeBron James.   Nobody can argue with me, yet I can be called a, 'piece of shit human garbage,' for my opinion yet I need to be removed from r/NBA because I am betting against LeBron. Worst case scenerio, I am going to bet LeBron in the Finals, like I did the past the 5 times he lost the Finals. "
LeBron James and it’s not even close. Also Kawhi is a better shooter 
"Lebron James, so your argument is invalid."
Terrible move by Bud. Raps have no superstar and are just a slightly better version of the Hawks team he had that won 60 games and still got swept by Lebron James. In 2 year he'll end up in the same spot he was in with Atlanta when Toronto has to blow it up. 
All I’m saying is LeBron James. 
I always dreamed of seeing a Steve Nash/Lebron James pick and role.
TL;DR reasons the Cavs will make it past the Celtics: Lebron James plays for them 
"Will I? Go check the 2015-2016 All-Star roster, LeBron James was the only All-Star representing Cleveland. "
"Yes, go look it up. LeBron James was the only Cavalier all-star that season. "
"Look, clearly it's close between these two. I just think it's crazy that now because of how the past 3 months have gone, people act like Al Horford is some superstar that has always been regarded as such. Celtics fans called him ""Average Al"". There were countless posts about how Al is not worth a max contract.   I love Al, I thought he was perennially underrated by even Celtics fans.  My argument is that Gordon was generally believed to be a better player. I literally just googled NBA player rankings 2017. Here are the top 3 lists. I didn't pick and choose. Literally just the top 3 results  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/sports/nba-top-100-players-2017/?utm_term=.896db2afb8f8  Gordon 17, Al 29  https://www.sbnation.com/2017/9/18/16175476/nba-player-rankings-top-100-2017-lebron-james  Gordon 18, Al 40  https://www.si.com/nba/2017/09/11/top-100-nba-players-2018-list-rankings  Gordon 16, Al 30  ESPN #PlayerRank had Gordon 20, Horford 40.   Does this prove who is a better player? Of course not. I'm just pointing out that Gordon was clearly regarded as the better player.  "
 King of the Crabs for lebron james is amazing
it's funny that it is lebron james who has a photographic memory and uses for basketball and it's like the stuff that superhero tales are made out of.  now if an Asian guy were to have a photographic memory and used it for physics then he's a loserrrrrrrr.  
Brian Windhorst made a career in reporting on LeBron James and now he is reporting on Bron's polar opposite: Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Does this gave have journalistic range or what?
"Dear Silver, I wrote you but you still ain't callin' I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom   I sent two messages at the league office back in July, you must not have got em There probably was a problem with the connection going awry   Sometimes I talk too softly especially when I'm on the sly   But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's Lebron?   My Knicks could really use him, that would really be the bomb   If we win a title guess what?   My balls will no longer be swollen   I really think you need to do something about James Dolan   I had a friend kill himself over the good times that ass has stolen   I know you probably hear this everyday, but I fucking hate your refs   I want to put them underground so I'm no longer in duress   Every day with Dolan running this team I stay stressed   I like the shit David Stern did with Ewing, that was sick   Anyways, I hope you get Ayton, on the Knicks   Don't be dick, I want this guy, or else you'll die   This is Py  "
But those three sentences have nothing to do with each other.  &gt; I don't think he makes Simmons irrelevant at all.   Okay.  Why not?  &gt; If Lebron James wants to join your team you make it happen.   Duh.  But why would he when he would make Simmons irrelevant?  &gt; Simmons inability to shoot is a huge hindrance that he has to fix no matter who he plays with.  He isn't going to have a jumper by next year.  So you think he's irrelevant when playing with Lebron?
LeBron James. I'm never worried. 
I don't think he makes Simmons irrelevant at all. If Lebron James wants to join your team you make it happen. Simmons inability to shoot is a huge hindrance that he has to fix no matter who he plays with.
"unless it's last year's or this year's finals, in which betting against LeBron James is very easy and smart to do"
Rule #1 of NBA: never bet against LeBron James  Edit: in the Eastern Conference playoffs
"The reason I said earlier which you clearly ignored. They had no direction as a team, coaching is a big part of the NBA. When was the last time a team with a poor coach without a player named LeBron James on it won 50+ games?  &gt;a team missing their two best players.  They more than likely gave Boston their biggest challenge of the East. They just bitched a team you guys got swept by, and eased past Philly. The talent clearly showed against Boston, all they need now is a good coach. "
" I think the argument is valid because that’s exactly why they used him the way they did. He definitely closed games but the way they used him allowed him to be fresher at the end of games at 30 MPG than say, LeBron James and Kobe who were playing 40 mpg. The difference is not negligible. "
"LeBron James is one of the 10 most slowest players in the league, walking over 90% of the time in a game. LeBron walks more than most in the NBA. "
"I think this is a good idea. The Cavs need to play more physical. I’d like to see more post play out of them. They have 3 guys who can body people in the post: Kevin Love (on offense and the boards), Tristan Thompson (on defense and the boards), and LeBron James (depending on what the matchup is he can be effective on offense, defense, or rebounding in the post to an extent). Baynes and Horford might create some problems in the post, but adding Bron into the mix as a threat to post up creates a lot of problems. Morris might be able to contest LeBron in the post, but Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum would have some problems. Having 3 post threats in your lineup against this Celtics team could be very beneficial."
Adam Silver is NOT going to let Lebron James lose now
"yeah but everyone knows this is only being brought up to shit on Lebron James. It's a shit on Lebron James thread, there's no discussion to be had."
"Middleton was on another level. Dude was like Kobe out there. Its laughable to think that Kevin Love can even match his efforts.   Unless Lebron puts up close to 40 a night for the next 4/6 games against the NBAs best defense it seems unlikely. At the same time, its Lebron James so its possible."
A team that would give up the pieces required to get Lebron James would no longer be a team Lebron James wants to join. 
"&gt; “It’s not March Madness. You get better throughout the series. … I’ve been down 0-1, down 0-2, I’ve been down before,” LeBron said after the game. “There’s no level of concern no matter how bad I played.” James spent the large portion of the game deferring to his teammates, which he’s done in the past to “feel out” the opponent. **In Game 2, he’ll likely turn on Terminator mode.** But LeBron can’t do it alone. Trouncing Boston’s defense, or beating any potential NBA Finals opponent, requires more innovation.  They actually reversed jinxed it in the article."
"!remindme 3 months  Dallas lets Noel walk and signs a decent starter to a big contract to try to make the playoffs again next year (someone like Nurk)  Denver re-signs Barton and runs it back with the same roster   Warriors sign another somewhat known FA for a min that everyone bitches about (hi nick young, javale mcgee, omri casspi, and david west)  Rockets re-sign CP3 to a longterm deal and try to grab another cheap versatile defensive wing type like Ariza, Tucker and LMAM.  Clips try to unload Gallo in the offseason but can't find a partner and mostly run it back with their temporary core of Williams/Rivers/Harris/Gallo/ and Jordan who accepts his PO because no one will max him   Lakers sign PG but can't get the other max player they want so they re-sign Randle (for what will be seen as an overpay for a solid player aka the Harrison Barnes)  Grizzlies re-sign Reke and with a healthy(er) Gasol and Conley try to make the playoffs again with their draft pick.  Wolves trade Tyus for some kind of wing or draft pick and re-sign rose and Thibs is blasted for it. (he's right to do it btw, Tyus CANNOT stay in front of any sort of guard that can create his own shot and CANNOT score or shoot.  He's basically Rubio without the elite defense, FT drawing, and size)  Pels re-sign Boogie to a 3 or 4 year contract and basically come back with the same team.  Melo opts in (duh) and OKC has to run in back starting Melo and Grant at the forward spots  PHO drafts doncic by finally not dropping in the lottery and are the worst defense in the league again next year running Luka/Booker/Jackson/Chriss/Bender   Portland finally learns a lesson from Turner, Leonard and Crabbe and lets Nurk walk when a biggish offer comes in.  They just do the smart thing and hold onto Ed Davis while running the same team back cause they're in cap hell but at least they make the playoffs (lol @ Detroit and Charlotte)  Kings - Draft another project that they won't be able to develop and overpay again for a mediocre old player whose name that Vivek knows  Spurs - Popp sits down with Kawhi this summer and they work this out and he comes back healthy next year before signing that super max.  TP walks as the spurs have a logjam at PG and he wants to play and to get money somewhere (chicago, phoenix or orlando maybe)  Jazz - Favors for Parker swap   Hawks - Take on more bad contracts for assets and tank again.  Trade Schroder if the right offer comes in.   Celtics - They poke around Kawhi and PG but ultimately decide to keep their team together and re-sign Smart while trading Rozier (he's at his max value ever, I think he's solid but he's not as good as he's been in this playoffs and Ainge knows that).  Nets - Keep trying to collect assets for salary (they might be capped actually but I can't be fucked to check).  Don't extend Lin or Dlo cause injury concerns.  Might trade one of their points (Lin, Dlo and Spencer) looking for a big that can shoot and maybe a pick  Charlotte - run it back and see if a new HC can bring them back to the playoffs and out of this 30-40 win hell.  Bulls - Match someone who threw a max or near max at LaVine to cap fuck them (Mavs, Suns or Magic maybe? there's not much cap)   Cavs - if James leaves then they try to build around Love and the Nets pick (they're in too much cap trouble to tear it down) they're going to be a first round exit without James.    Pistons - They're in cap hell without a pick or the ability to make the playoffs.  They better pray that either Stanley Johnson find his way outta LeBron's head or that Silver gives them a takesie backsies with picking Kennard over Mitchell.  Pacers - Bring back the squad this year (actually please go after PG13 for the memes)  Heat - Try to cash in all their middling assets for a middling star like Demar, Kemba or CJ.  Fail and have to just be a first round exit/barely miss playoffs until these contracts expire.  Bucks - Hire bud and become a good to great defensive team by trading parker for favors and finally having an actual NBA level big man. Still mediocre on offense as their half court offense is cramped with Bledsoe, Giannis and Favors being bad to below average shooters.  Knicks - Tank another year as Kristaps will only come back for a few games at the end of the year.  please knicks don't be dumb and let the beas walk.  Orlando - I haven't thought about Orlando since they starting like 8-2. I don't even know what they guna do  Phillie - Go after all the white whales (LBJ, PG and Kawhi). Strike out and decide to just re-sign JJ for a 3/21 deal and run it back.  Raptors - Masai will hire either one of their 3 in house guys that are candidates or some intl guy i've never heard of.  They'll still be good and maybe great in the regular season but they won't be able to beat any of LeBron, Phillie or Boston in the playoffs.  Wizards - Ship out Gortat and whichever else of their role players that keeps starting shit w Wall.  Run it back and lose in the first round again while talking shit the whole time"
"It felt like he wanted to do that thing where he chills while the team goes down big, hanging up top and hitting shooters off screens before eventually hitting a big 3 and hitting a few layups/dunks to spark a run. Then the three missed, Boston contained the drive, and he decided it was a ""better luck next time"" scenario.   Weird stuff. Like, he gets upset and walks back sometimes, maybe takes a few plays to get his head right again, but most of the game didn't feel like watching LeBron James."
also love kills us.  We are to kevin love what the raptors are to lebron james
We don’t want LeBron James.
not wanting to give up terry rozier for a season of lebron james is peak boston fan
if they had a chance to acquire LeBron James in exchange for Shane Larkin I think Kyrie would get over it
"Yeah he’s done. In fact, I would take Marcus Morris over LeBron James at this point. He outplayed him and simply demonstrated yesterday that he shows up when it counts.  /s"
"&gt;LeBron James will milk free agency, building up as much tension as he can until on the last day of free agency, he signs a max deal with Cleveland, committing to stay with the Cavs for the rest of his career.  yeah i'll be really shocked if this doesn't happen"
I hate watching LeBron James...he was good yesterday though 
"I'm not rooting for the Warriors dynasty in general, but I like them a hell of a lot more than the Rockets. I know it's not some fresh new take when I say that I find James Harden and CP3 to be extremely unlikable. I really like most of the Warriors players, and the basketball they play is very exciting to watch. I'd also root for them over the Cavs, because fuck LeBron. "
"We have way less talent than the Celtics even without Kyrie and Hayward gtfoh. We lost LeBron/Wade/Bosh for literally nothing in return and are still a playoff team. Our roster literally includes Dion/James Johnson/Wayne Ellington/Whiteside/second round pick. All these players get heavy minutes, I wish we had the talent that the Celtics had. Spo &gt; Stevens."
"I think this KOC article sums up my thoughts pretty well. https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/14/17351226/boston-celtics-defense-lebron-james-game-1  There are counters for the cavs to employ to soften the Celtics defense. I think game 1 was a feeling out process and Lebron kinda packed it in after the first quarter run. This is gonna be a long series. I'm looking forward to seeing how this young group responds when the cavs punch them back in the mouth, if they can withstand that constant downhill pressure of the Cavs offense when they're clicking."
"The Celtics just dismantled them. Cavs couldn’t make open shots, which I’m sure won’t be the case all series. I can see Celtics winning in 6. Otherwise, LeBron James."
"Lebron james is a really great player and he has a terrible game, not just with his shot missing but with his overall effort   They probably still win the series with him balling out   The problem is people try to compare him to Jordan, you get graded on way higher standards at that point. To me he was already eliminated from that conversation after that last series vs Boston as a cav (1st time around) and after the 17ppg Mavs series (5th in points in that series).   Truly great player, not my goat"
"***July 1, 2018.  12:01 A.M.***  [Wojnarowski]  LeBron James, Paul George, and Demarcus Cousins have all signed max contracts with the Warriors."

FWIW - yesterday's game from LeBron ties for his 9th worst playoff performance by GameScore. Jordan had 3 games with lower GameScores.
LeBron James is the real Captain America
Lemme try guess this.  Jordan:  - Magic Johnson - James Worthy - Clyde Drexler - Terry Porter - Charles Barkley - Kevin Johnson - Gary Payton - Shawn Kemp - Karl Malone - John Stockton   Duncan:   - Patrick Ewing - Latrell Sprewell - Allan Houston - Jason Kidd - Kenyon Martin - Chauncey Billups - Ben Wallace  - Rasheed Wallace  - LeBron James - Dwyane Wade - Chris Bosh  Kobe:   - Reggie Miller - Allen Iverson - Dikembe Mutumbo - Jason Kidd - Kenyon Martin - Dwight Howard - Paul Pierce - Kevin Garnett - Ray Allen - Rajon Rondo  LeBron:  - Russell Westbrook  - Tim Duncan - Kawhi Leonard - Tony Parker - Manu Ginobili - Stephen Curry - Kevin Durant  - Klay Thompson - Draymond Green 
"If The 76ers think they can build a package for Kawhi that revolves around Fultz and the Lakers pick \(assuming things work in their favor...\), AND the Warriors lose to the Rockets, then the 76ers need to pursue KD, NOT LeBron James. This is assuming Redick re\-signs on a team friendly contract, and they retain TJ/RoCo \(high hopes, I know; this would still be fine if they lose RoCo though, with proper staggering of minutes\).  PG \- Simmons\*/TJ McConnell\*  SG \- Redick/Bellinelli  SF \- Kawhi\*/RoCo/TLC  PF \- KD\*/Saric\*  C \- Embiid\*/Johnson/Holmes   This squad is much better than having LeBron on it, because it comes with 6 playmakers \(the guys I starred; they can do at least one of dribbling, passing, or buying a bucket\), and they're at various positions. Of these dudes, only Simmons creates spacing issues, so you're giving him two wings that can shoot and one of the most skilled Centers in the game to work with. The only one that can't defend that well is Dario. After him, Redick is the weakest link on defense, and stats peg him as being fairly average.  Oh, and they can roll out guard/wing/wing/wing/center lineups like TJ/Kawhi/KD/Simmons/Biid or a HUGE line up like Simmons/Kawhi/KD/Dario/Biid without giving up any spacing.  KD works better with this team than LeBron, because Simmons can set him up for days. "
"Hmmm, if this James Harden I would be angry but it's LeBron so I'm smitten instead. He's just revealing a flaw in FTs and how the NBA uses them. "
Playing against LeBron James on the playoffs is no pressure? K.
Lebron James is this generation’s Latrell Sprewell. Spree...for 3!
PG: Allen Iverson  SG: Stephen Curry  SF: Michael Jordan  PF: LeBron James  C: Wilt Chamberlain
"They should try and get some more weak side movement after getting Lebron the ball instead of standing and waiting. they need to keep moving with cuts, screens and constant motion to try in the hope that the young Celtics team loses a man \( I know this isn't really their game\).   There were a few possessions today where James caught the ball in the post and was doubled from the weak side before he had a chance to spot the man coming... I'm imaging Lebron will be more attune to this and be getting off some quick passes to the man in the corner and making the defense recover.   They really need to stick with a lineup that tries to stretch the floor, but they just need to get the ball to the open man before the Celtics players close out.   Try and take Horford out of the game as much as possible on both ends of the court, but keep mixing things up. If they get to predictable he will pick them apart.   The Celtics love to switch on defense and it's a huge part of what make them successful, but perhaps try and use this against them. Try and get Tatum guarding Lebron on the drive and Love in the post a little and see how the rookie responds to this.   Give the ball to Lebron with more momentum. Korver and JR on the weak side, Hill dribble hand off to Lebron who uses a Love screen at full speed to break up the defense. It looked like today and Celtics took away Lebron's drive game and part of this was because they didn't give him space to get moving.   Just my thoughts and could be completely wrong. "
"Believing Jordan is better than LeBron is like believing Alfredo Di Stefano is better than Messi because he won 5 European Cups or like believing Bill Russell will always be the GOAT cause he won 11.   A ridiculously stupid notion that hinges on mystique and buzzwords like ""clutch"". There has never been a better basketball player than LeBron James. Winning is heavily team reliant. "
"Did LeBron have the same luxury as Kobe and Jordan in having the GOAT coach Phil? What about the makeup of those teams? Phil knew how to build around those stars, giving them adequate defenders, role players. The year Jordan retired in 1993, their record was 55-27. It seems the year prior Jordan was only worth two wins. Does LeBron have a semi competent coach in Tyron Lue? Not likely. LeBron may not be clutch like Jordan but there's no other person in history that elevates a team more than James. Last time I checked basketball was a team sport. "
"""How could he say a mean thing to me? I'm just a poor blue worker toiling away all day in the mines. How could such an evil man be allowed to say such vulgarities to me?"" -- Actual LeBron James quote circa May 14th, 2018"
"Just using the terminology Rachel Nichols used in her bit last year:  https://youtu.be/u1qidKcwjeE?t=65  There was also an article about it in 2014 where they talk about his eidetic memory:  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11067098/lebron-james-greatest-weapon-brain  &gt; ""I can usually remember plays in situations a couple of years back -- quite a few years back sometimes,"" James says.

But if there are areas of consensus in the field of neurology, one of them is that the notion of ""photographic memory,"" in which a person can take mental snapshots and recall every detail at a later time, has never been proved to exist.  &gt; This is not to say that James is lying when he describes his total recall. The evidence appears strong that his memory banks are loaded up like Fort Knox. Rather, what James might be describing appears more likely to be a version of ""eidetic memory,"" which is, essentially, the medical term for crazy, crazy freakish recall. And although eidetic memory appears to take many forms -- some claim to be able to ""read"" pages in their mind, others to ""replay"" their memories as if pressing play on streaming video -- those who claim the ability often share one trait: They are as cursed by it as they are blessed by it."

"Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love together, is a better combination than just Lebron James, and Kyrie Irving alone. Kevin Love was additive to that situation, but the issue of your players talents, is not just a sum of its parts type of matter. There might be 3 talented guys, but there's just 1 basketball. multiple all stars are going to diminish each other to an extent. Look what happened to both Chris bosh and Kevin love once they started having to share the floor with 2 great ball handlers. The production of Kyrie when he's the only all star, combined with the production of Kevin Love when he's the only all star? definitely more production overall than Shaq by himself. The production of those 2 when they're working together, along with LeBron who's going to take so many touches away from the both of them? That's a lot more debatable. "
"..,  Ummmmmm. Lebron would have 3 less rings without Kyrie or Wade. Or James Jones for that matter.  "
"The real question is how you have a Cleveland and LeBron James flair, but you say Celtics vs rockets is the dream."
"There has only been one game in this series, so naturally it will be Celitcs players heavy if that is your criteria. If you are basing it off of playoffs as a whole however, and aren't wanting to circle jerk some player rankings, I would say it is:  1. LeBron James 2. Al Horford 3. Jayson Tatum 4. Jaylen Brown 5. Kevin Love 6. Terry Rozier 7. Marcus Smart 8. Kyle Korver or JR Smith  Love is averaging 15/10 on 39/38/89 shooting on 5+ 3PTA per game. His 2PT FG% has been meh, but he's shooting great from 3, and has a decent eFG%. That is definitely better than Marcus Morris who is averaging 12/5 on 35/39/72 shooting, albeit better defense, or Marcus Smart who is shooting absolutely atrocious splits thus far. "
People saying Celtics.... are we forgetting about LeBron James?   
"PG's skillset fits better with the Sixers but Lebron James is Lebron James, no matter what team you're talking about he's always the best option."
This thread is gonna be awfully funny come Game 6. Never be against Lebron James for too long...
"Bro i literally could not give less of a fuck what you think, however retarded, jaded, and whatever adjective or noun there is in the world to describe your ignorance of the dominance of lebron. No one here took offense, I simply acknowledged the silliness of your rationale to discount the achievements of a universally regarded top 3 player of all Time.  I just sincerely enjoy shitting on idiots with clearly flawed viewpoints. You can think whatever you want, but I will consider your reasons moronic, and chastise you every time you repeat this nonsense if im in the vicinity. Why? Because this is a free country, and you can have whichever foolish opinion you have, and I am completely within my rights to shit on it as I please.  But please dont think so highly of yourself that your opinion on where you rank the Rick Barry’s of the world over lebron james really “affects me.” I, as all educated college students, take joy in deconstructing a weak argument. But you can keep your opinion, as I will with mine, and we can move forward with our lives, offense free "
"Love of course. Swap Love with Horford and see what happens to Horford's numbers playing with lebron james and what happens to Love playing to another team, far from lebron. Love is just way more talented offensively.   Sure Love was never the undisputable killer instict superstar but he is still a superstar while horford isnt. If u wanna argue that horford works better for celtics cause he plays better D etc etc then sure but Love is a way better talent. "
Windhorst wrote a great article about LeBron's photographic memory a while back. http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11067098/lebron-james-greatest-weapon-brain
"MJ, Magic, Kareem, Bird, Wilt, Kobe, Shaq, Bill Russell, Hakeem, Julius Erving, Rick Barry, LeBron James."
"&gt; LeBron James will milk free agency, building up as much tension as he can until on the last day of free agency, he signs a 3 year deal with Cleveland.  If LeBron re-signs with Cleveland, he's going to yank them around again with a short-term deal. Why? Because he can.  &gt; Once the NBA finals is over, Kawhi Leonard trade talks will skyrocket, with so many teams looking to acquire him, the biggest candidates being the Lakers, **the Timberwolves** and the Sixers.  And...you lost me here, so I stopped reading. The Wiggins + picks + trash for Kawhi stories on SB Nation or wherever you found them are garbage. The Spurs are not stupid. And Kawhi isn't going to force a trade to play in a worse market than San Antonio for a coach who is going to grind that quad into hamburger meat rather than play for Pop."
"LOL. Bro im a celtics fan and I’m not even this jaded. Its been 1 game, *waaaay* too soon to put it in writing that tje series is over.  The current lebron is better than any version of Kobe in all aspects of the game except perhaps perimeter defnese and whatever “skill” argument you use to say Kobe has to “make tough shots.”  There is quite literally nothing Kobe does that Lebron can’t do as well as, or better, except maybe conveniently forget that he was the 1B to Shaq’s 1A for 60% of his rings. Lebron James, if not for MJ, is the greatest basketball player the world has seen/would have seen. Get your purple haze glasses off your face to see the facts kid. Rings aint all that counts cause there are 4 other guys on the court and countless off the court that made that ring happen. "
"MJ, Magic, Kareem, Bird, Wilt, Kobe, Shaq, Bill Russell, Hakeem, Julius Erving, Rick Barry, LeBron James. Lebron so far away from Kobe. "
LeBron James will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies 
"They initially did better. Triano for Watson as one example. Players usually have better relationships with the assistants. Because those assistants play nice.  I think Danny opts out. He would rather sign for the same amount or MLE at 3+ years if the market is deflated for the security.   Gay stands to make more than 8.6 open market.   I mean they have the choice of renouncing cap holds or running it back.   As for the Clips:  That’s what they could do in this deal after the draft; After they sign James   They have 75m tied up if Teo opts out. As well as DJ and Rivers. They renounce all 3. (Ofcourse deals where they sign and trade some of them ori f they opt in to receive picks that they can use in the kawhi or other deals is preferential.) They would have to trade guys Like Gallo or Wes Johnson or Boban with whatever picks they have to get about 9m in room. Or take a bad contract in return like Parsons to get a team eat enough into their cap this year.   Because the deal would then be Harris, Dekker, Thornwell and the 11 and 12 picks already been selected for Kawhi.  Not sure if they renounce Teo if they can use the MLE to sign Teo back.  plus MLE to go after Noel   If Clips pursue a trade with Kawhi at the draft. involving Harris, Boban, Dekker, and the picks. It would net them 66.9m in cap commits if all their POs (DJ, Rivers etc) are not picked up and holds renounced.  In the event they take their PO. they would have to be moved at literally no money coming back. Which for most of them that might net you a small asset (2nd rounder back) and a massive TPE for DJ.   So you're right keeping DJ is near impossible if you want Kawhi and LeBron. Unless they somehow get a taker for Gallo. But i think they are better off finding a suitor for DJ if he opts in. Keeping Gallos shooting and replacing DJ with Noel. "
So Kobe Bryant at his physical best as far as quickness and vertical or LeBron James in his championship final form?
"Mr Incredible is LeBron James. Syndrome is Jayson Tatum, and the trigger event was LeIncredible not following back on twitter. The poster dunk is Kronos"
"That team does not have to be done growing after they pick up Lebron and George. They will still have the young assets and the ability to try to trade for another player or make roster changes beyond just getting stars.   Besides, we just saw a team led by Harden and Paul with really solid supporting players take the Warriors to 7. I doubt the Lakers would be counting themselves out with Lebron James and Paul George. "
"&gt; ""in an interview with Mike Vokunov of The Athletic, Jeremy Lin says it never ceases to amaze him how many street ballers think they beat him ... and tell him so!  Isn't it possible that they're just trolling him? If it'd get me a one-on-one game, I'd tell Michael Jordan or LeBron James to their face that they suck and that I could beat them!"
"&gt; pg13 isn’t a good enough second option to lebron and Lakers know it.  I think we should be a little more careful about saying so freely what the Lakers know or believe. The talk around that team has always been George and Lebron James. The Warriors have 4 guys and so if a team can, it obviously won't want to stop at just having 2. But those two guys have always been the central pieces around which the Lakers have been planning as far as we know.   &gt;  The desperation that comes from the lakers part is that the only way they can get all three is if the spurs play ball so they’ll have to over pay.  Kawhi will be a free agent in 2019. Trading for him now is not the only way. Kawhi is also not the only player. They have young assets they could move for another player.   We just saw the Lakers not give up their best prospects last year in an effort to trade for Paul George despite getting George probably being the only way they can get Lebron. We've already seen this story. The Spurs are the team with the expiring superstar who wants out. They do not have that great of leverage on anyone right now, not the Lakers, not the Celtics, no one. That's an extremely weak position to be in. The stuff about the Lakers desperation is exaggeration mixed with speculation that isn't backed by anything. It certainly isn't backed by the history of how these things play out or how this played out for the Lakers last time.   &gt; the only way spurs help the lakers start another dynasty is if they get a huge haul. Yeah, kawhi’s value dropped but it’s mostly due to him only having one year on his contract, its normal for a superstar to have a few preferred destinations that’s not out of the ordinary.  Of course it has to do with him being on an expiring contract, but those are not separate points. Kawhi having preferred destinations and being on an expiring contract means teams that sign him that aren't on his list run a greater risk of losing him after only one season. If his list featured a lot more teams it would be much less of a problem that he's expiring. You dismiss by saying it isn't out of the ordinary, but that's hardly actually a point at all. We've seen stars use this type of thing to reduce their value. That is absolutely how it works.    &gt; The spurs can easily just trade him to the celtics and get brown, a pick and Morris which is better than taking Deng, ball and any other player not named Ingram. Any rival team would rather take less from a team in a different conference than having to play against their old superstar 4 times a year plus playoffs.   The Spurs cannot easily do anything. They have no assurance the Celtics would give up Brown and a pick. I would make that trade, but we don't know. I would trust that Kawhi would like it in Boston enough to stay, but that is a big risk for the Celtics. They may determine that it is not worth it to give up those assets for a possible one year rental. This goes back to the preferred destination point. We've seen the Celtics not give up assets like these young guys over and over again for other star forwards. These guys have never been more valuable than they are right now. It's probably less likely that the Celtics will give one of them up right now.   Again with other teams besides the Lakers it is unlikely they will give up major assets for Kawhi. You are making the mistake of overvaluing stars on expiring contracts. These guys who got traded were largely moved for deals that at least appeared weak at the time. Teams are generally not knocking down your door for a guy who they might have for only one year.   Emotion matters, they probably don't want to trade him to the Lakers, but seeing him 4 times matters less than what you get back. If the Spurs are trading Kawhi it isn't exactly going to be the Lakers blocking their path to a title, it will be the lack of talent on their roster.    "
"You don't really think replacing TT with DJ and adding Kemba is enough do you?  LeBron had to reach into the power of the gods themselves to even get that team to the finals. If the Pacers weren't so young Cleveland wouldn't have made it out of the first round my dude.   If he leaves he's gonna go team you with Paul George, maybe Kawhi, and some good players in LA or CP3 and James Harden down in Houston."
So u believe the Clippers and Michael Jordan are about to help LeBron James get another ring?
"To be fair, this hypothetical isn't particularly rosy for us from an injury standpoint:  - LeBron James will be 34 years old, which makes him an injury risk despite his perfect record thus far - Paul George just had a mysterious knee surgery - Kawhi Leonard just had a mysterious knee injury that probably fractured his relationship with the Spurs - Lonzo Ball has had major problems with durability"
"Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Dwyane Wade off the top of my head are a few"
"I say LeBron James and then slow walk into the key, pushing out smaller defenders and often traveling. "
"DJ and rivers would have to opt out. Something they plan on anyways.   You send Harris, Dekker, Wes Johnson/Thornwell and the lottery picks for Kawhi.   Johnson if trade before the draft, Thornwell if after.   If you did this trade at the draft. You have 70m (76m) if Teodosic opts in.   That’s why they do this deal after the draft.  After they sign James and Jordan or Rivers.  They have 46m tied up if Teo opts out.   They sign LeBron for 35m. That’s 81m tied up.    First they ask D Jordan if he wants to join a superteam. They will give him security but he has to accept 20m and this is only if teo opts out. Otherwise they sign Rivers, kid has to take a paycut (10-13m) with the promise they re-sign him long term next year.  Not sure if they sign DJ, then renounce Teo if they can use the MLE to sign him.  Otherwise sign Rivers and go after Noel to replace DJ.   And that is how they can get Kawhi LeBron And perhaps DJ.  I would love to explore a scenario where they can shed Gallinari and to after PG. But Gallo could be super useful in this lineup.    (Ofcourse there is the very fun option that if everyone opts out they can chase lbj and cp3 if the both take 27m. Unlikely.)     "
"No idea, but this guy named Antonio Blakeney averaged 32 ppg in the Gleague last season for the Windy City Bulls.  He may or may not be the next Lebron James"
I'm a black man who high fives with the best of em. You already know my resumé. I don't need to tell you that this hand has high fived the king LeBron James and this hand has been close and interpersonal with one Kobe Bryant. We don't need to get into that. My high five pedigree is solid. So when I say that is a problem you know it's coming from a place of experience and expertise only I can provide. Believe me. 
"&gt; There are maybe 10 players in the NBA making more than $1 million a year on endorsements  There's a lot more than 10 players making $1M+  1. LeBron James: $52 million  2. Stephen Curry: $42 million  3. Kevin Durant: $33 million  4. James Harden: $20 million  5. Russell Westbrook: $19 million  6. Kyrie Irving: $14 million  7. Damian Lillard: $14 million  8. Dwayne Wade: $14 million  9. Giannis Antetokounmpo: $13 million  10. Klay Thompson: $13 million  Then you start adding Melo, Blake, PG, DRose, CP3, DeMar, Dwight etc etc etc...the list goes on and on till you'd get to under $1M"
if reddit was around at this time the takes would be spicy *Shannon Brown proved today he has a higher ceiling than Lebron James*

"As a Rockets fan I have very little confidence in landing Lebron James. Looks like we’re losing Ariza, CP3 could still sign elsewhere. We still may or may not sign Capela. Rockets could look entirely different next season. "
"They really aren’t though, can you name a big market team that Kawhi could join where he wouldn’t immediately be the best player?? If he wants to be on a big market team without the attention he can literally only join the Warriors or the LeBron James.   Edit: Or maybe the Knicks I guess but at that point you may as well stay with the GOAT coach"

"I swear everytime skip talks about the spurs with lebron james in the same sentence, its 2014 finals. By a record margin."
"At this point after this headline and all of this controversy he would absolutely be.   ""Skeeeeeeeeyuppppp, now the boy said he don't want the pressure of being the star of the team. He said that Skip. Finals MVP, dee-fensive player of the year said that.  Well, Skip he ain't DAMN near the star of ANY team with no LeBron James on it-tuh. And he goes for sixteen points on 6 for 19 shooting?! SIX FOR NINETEEN SKIP. For this LeBron might as well have stayed in Cleveland, ALL STAR FORWARD Kevin Love went 21 and 10 in the finals. You know Skip, I think I know why he's so quiet. I think I know Skip. Skip, he wanted to go out to LA to get some of that weeeeeeeeeeee-duh."" et al  If Kawhi doesn't play 82 games and put up All NBA numbers while playing first team defense he is going to be crucified in the media by the whole legion of hot take merchants chomping at the bit to find a new villain now that everyone is kind of bored at shitting on KD. Doesn't matter where he goes doesn't matter what he does. And if he's the major piece LeBron chooses to team up with for his final shot at history and doesn't produce? BRUH"
"I don't even want to go over his playstyle cause that will cause more holes in the argument, but you are right, James is the engine for his super-team and when he underperforms they do fail.   But that still doesn't justify the hate that KD receives for joining a well-drafted team, and created a super-team. You can't hate one creating a super-team and completely accepting another. Just cause KD gets to tag along, whereas James has to work hard(You even acknowledge that his playstyle can be part of the blame). They still made the same damn move. Find better teammates, (whether joining a team or creating one) so they can have better chances to win a championship.  Then you become a biased hypocrite. I don't think we should hate Lebron or KD for creating super-teams, they've existed for many years. We should hate fans who criticize players for doing what is in their best interest and enjoy their greatness."
"I was bored today so I took a shot at this. I have Klay just inside my Top 20 and Draymond just outside.

"Except MJ never said he’s the greatest of all time, in fact he once said he doesn’t honk he’s the GOAT because he never got to compete against the Kobe Bryant’s, the Lebron James’, the Bill Russell’s, the Wilt Chamberlain’s. I could bring up examples of why I think Lebron&gt;Jordan, but is there anything I can say that’ll sway you. "
"Nah, he needs to play for the spurs but with LeBron.  Media always goes at James like crazy so everyone else can basically just do their thing and ignore it.  "
Lonzo Ball WILL in fact make LeBron James better. 
"&gt;You can’t prove circumvention or prosecute on it. Without evidence.  Like in a court of law? Yeah of course.  There is already precedent for Vetoing a trade that didn't actually break any laws. The Dallas-Nets trade involving Stackhouse. They stopped the trade because they thought it ""didn't follow the spirit of the rules"".  The commissioner has incredible discretion with what he is allowed to do.  &gt;And given the issue of rebuilding with Kawhi the hornets would stand fast on Marvin. Given you have gotten rid of Marvin or Zeller in the Kawhi trade.  IDK where Zeller came from but either way, if the stand fast then the Spurs can just trade him to Boston or LA. He has already spoken of his willingness to play there. This isn't in a vacuum. There are other teams making offers too.  &gt;One that the nba has never addressed and has allowed an opportunity like this. It’s less obvious than say Gilbert hiring lebron as ceo of Quicken and circumventing with a lessened salary. Or Mickey Arison giving LeBron James a Miami club to own while he takes a paycut.  Yeah but those things never happened so I don't see how its a relevant example lol  &gt;I have no idea what an assistant said to Kawhi  Yeah so don't just assume he likes him and everything is fine  &gt;But most contact would could from Pop, fellow players or management. Assistant coaches don’t usually stick their noses in.  Please tell me more about your knowledge of how the inner workings of an NBA franchise and their coaching staff are usually conducted.  You're just making shit up. You have no idea how any of it works.  &gt;This is literally the trade Jordan talked about doing for Kemba. I think it is a darkhorse.  Just because Jordan talked about it doesn't mean Kawhi would ever actually want to go. Doesn't mean the Spurs would want to do it either.  &gt;May I ask what team you support? Nvm Sixers. A possible contender for Kawhi.  Actually no I don't. It is a bandwagon flair from the play offs.  &gt;So where is he going? In your estimation. Because I’m not saying Charlotte is the favourite just they have a shot. Low key city. Jordan connection and extra money.  Most likely. LA, Boston or less likely NY. Those are the teams that he both wants to go to and have assets to give back.  I also think the Clippers are a darkhorse, they have a bunch of attractive, moveable smaller assets.  Its also not really extra money. Because Jordan Brand has already told Kawhi they would give him the big deal if he went to a bigger market. So he could get that fat contract in like LA or Boston or NY for example."

that's *why* he's saying that. posted a version of this story earlier that gave way more context.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23814390/lebron-james-legend-cemented-no-need-chase-rings-says-shaquille-oneal  Shaq ring chasing at the end of his career made him miserable. so he's sharing that with LeBron. BR just leaves all that out.
There stats are not really what I use to put LeBron over Kobe.  It’s mostly watching both of them and I’m more impressed by James.
"The kids at the school I worked at in Boston usually went for ""LeBron"" or ""LeBron James"", though I also heard ""Curry"", ""Kobe"", and ""Kyrie"".   The kids at the camp I work at in the bay area have shouted ""Curry"" or ""Steph"" mostly, though on dunks I've heard them go for ""Javale McGee"".  My roommate at college goes for ""Kristaps Porzingis"" because he doesn't watch basketball but likes the name."
"If it takes an Ingram sacrifice to get Leonard, that’ll leave Lonzo (and by proxy Lavar), along with the potential signings of LeBron James and Paul George.   That means you’ve got LeBron James coming in as the New Face of the Lakers, Paul George, Lonzo Ball and Kawhi Leonard.   That’s about as good a shot as Leonard could get to keep the spotlight off of him and just do his job as an on-court enforcer for the squad.   Oh! You’ve also still got Magic Johnson at the helm of everything. So, of course Kawhi would have to fulfill his contractually obligation to the media, but the spotlight wouldn’t be on him as much as long he stuck to the company line-esque answers. "

"my ideal lebron squad assuming a salary cap:  patrick beverley / cory joseph  tony snell (or jj redick or danny green) / kyle korver  tyreke evans (or rudy gay) / pj tucker  lebron james / david west  deandre jordan / ed davis  lebron's ideal teammates can do two of three things well: play great man to man defense, hit threes, and get contested rebounds. he should also have a second guy who can create shots for himself, and none of his teammates should have big egos. he needs a point guard that is okay not being the primary ball handler, but is still quick enough to guard opposing star guards. everyone should play well off ball.   this is probably the worst team that i could see winning a championship with lebron, if they execute their system well and nobody chokes. i could see this team doing a 2011 mavs type of run.  tyreke i love because you can play him anywhere in the back court, even at point if you want, or you can play him at the 3. he can be a sixth man as well and be your backup ball handler when lebron is out. pat bev is the ideal lebron point guard and i'm amazed they haven't teamed up before, and he's a great fit with tyreke as well. deandre is like a better tristan thompson, basically, and i think tony snell is like a better and potentially cheaper version of danny green. he seems like he'd fit well on almost any team. redick is a monster off ball but i feel like he'd be very expensive. pj tucker showed that he's maybe the best bench player in the league, and cory joseph is likely the best backup pg in the league so i don't know if this team could get him. korver knows lebron's system well already, and david west is just so reliable to plug in anywhere as necessary. i always liked ed davis as well, high motor guy who is very solid at rebounding."

"Skip: Obviously Kawhi has been using his injury as a cover for his deep-seated insecurity. It's clear that he is mentally weak and fragile, like LeBron James.      Stephen A: THIS IS NOT ABOUT LEBRON JAMES       Skip: Everything is about LeBron James. Except LeBron James.      Stephen A: WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?! They have two totally different personalities!          Skip: They are both weak like helpless babies.          Stephen A: LEBRON WOULD BE THE MOST POWERFUL BABY OF ALL TIME        Skip: He wouldn't be able to find the nipple six times out of nine.      Stephen A: You are way out of line. QUITE FRANKLY I am disgusted by you and by Kawhi Leonard. This exactly the kind of obfuscation that he is practising RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK.       Skip: How does one even get into a rift with an organization like the Spurs? If it was LeBron James it'd be understandable, but we were led to believe that Kawhi was like Tim Duncan. And I am here to say that the two couldn't be any less alike.      Stephen A: WELL THANK YOU for pointing that out Skip. Quite frankly Tim Duncan is a dear friend of mine, and I will not stand to see him put in the same sentence as someone who wants to go to LOS ANGELES! TO HOLLYWOOD! RODEO DRIVE! BEVERLY HILLS! SUNSET BOULEVARD! THAT IS A MOVIE ABOUT A FADED STAR AND THE EMPTINESS AND FUTILITY OF PURSUING FAME! CAN YOU NOT SEE THE IRONY?       Skip: A faded star, just like LeBron James.       Stephen A: I WILL KILL YOU SKIP       Skip: See? LeBron is always getting someone else to do the dirty work for him. But you wouldn't be able to kill me, because LeBron would make you magically unable to shoot. He would need more help.      Stephen A: STOP. JUST STOP IT. This is about Kawhi Leonard and his uncle, who quite frankly has been putting poison in his nephew's ear. YOU'RE AN UNCLE! HOW DO YOU USE YOUR POSITION OF AUTHORITY AND INFLUENCE FOR SUCH IGNOBLE PURPOSES?        Skip: You know who else isn't an uncle? LeBron James. And even though he isn't an uncle, he uses his authority and influence for ignoble purposes. He and Kawhi will probably team up somewhere and form a brotherhood of weak fragile whiny babies.    Shannon: Thkeeup! How much longer do I have to stay under the table?      Skip: Quiet, you! Don't embarrass me in front of my friend!     Stephen A: Brother. You are my brother from another mother, Skip. And if you were uncle to my kids I'd tell them the same thing I'd say to Kawhi and all the other nephews out there: DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR UNCLE HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING AND HE SECRETLY LOVES LEBRON JAMES  "
"And no where as cool as the 8 first names on 3 guys in Houston- Chris Paul George, Lebron James Harden, Kawhi Leonard. Full all star lineup."
"and he won them all.  The power struggle happened right before the trade deadline in Okafor's rookie year when his value was at its highest too.  There were some rumors that okafor for one of the brooklyn picks was gonna happen but Colangelo shot it down.  Even if that isnt the case im riding with my guy that made the most trades during his tenure and just so happened to win every single one of them.  Like imagine how stupid you have to be to tell that guy he can't make a blockbuster trade.  Things look great going forward and theyre in the kawhi/lebron sweepstakes luckily but it might have been a slam dunk if Hinkie was never pushed out.  Doubt he trades that Sac pick to move up since his whole philosophy was about maximizing draft assets since its an inexact science.  So you potential have the Lakers pick, Sac Pick, AND a Brooklyn pick.  Man its such a great thought experiment to think about where theyd be today if Hinkie stayed.  Who does he take at 3 last draft?  What about 10th this draft?  He woulda been chomping at the bit for a disgruntled super star, he got the Sixers job with a powerpoint of how he helped Houston obtain James Harden when he was working with Morey.  With those 3 valuable picks you now have the best package available instead of boston and might have to only give up 1 player and 2 or 3 picks instead of 1 pick and 2 or 3 players.  It got flipped on its head man, he deserves all the love he gets."

Well if that's true have lebron james join the spurs and he won't be the number 1 guy on the team
About as embarrassing as a 26 year old Lebron James getting outscored by 33 year old Jason Terry in the NBA Finals.
People act like we were running pick and rolls and slashing like LeBron James lol
But he’s playing on a team with Paul George and LeBron James.  It’s not like the sole focus will be on him. 
"You realize this means we don't get Durant, the rivalry continues, and Lebron James *doesn't* leave in a few weeks right?"
"Definitely one of the most dominant players of all time, which is nothing groundbreaking, but he also benefited from the generally less talented (when compared to today's NBA) league...Players who he was challenged by, aka Bill Russell is very close in size to James Jones - LeBron James is very comparable in weight to Wilt, so as people have become bigger, stronger, faster over the years (look at the times of the world's top sprinters now vs then), very few players would be able to transcend generations. As discussed, tongue-in-cheek it must be said, on the LeBatard Show (which is the best show in radio history, I'll have no discussion on the matter), Jordan would be essentially DeMar DeRozan IN TERMS OF STYLE OF PLAY, which is very much NOT the current style of play, so yes, Wilt was amazingly dominant, but there's a large difference between BEST and MOST DOMINANT. LeBron is **IN MY PERSONAL RECORD BOOK** the greatest/best player of all time, I understand why people look to rings and what not, so I am not looking to parse semantics on Jordan vs LeBron because there will NEVER EVER be consensus on sports debates, but, that's my pitch if you will, not that it actually matters if I influence your opinion or not."
"&gt;You wanna know who DID carry his team through playoffs? LeBron.  Wait, are you telling me that you think LeBron James is better than Klay Thompson? Damn, that's a spicy take."
"Should I?  &gt; LeBron James isn't signing with the Utah Jazz, but he should probably think about it.  This is the first sentence.  For Lebron to sign with the Jazz means taking a $16M salary, or they have to dump something like $20m in salaries which is nearly impossible.  &gt; To get to that exact amount of cap space, Utah would have to trade Ricky Rubio's expiring contract and the No. 21 pick for no incoming salary; waive the non-guaranteed deals of Thabo Sefolosha, Jonas Jerebko and Ekpe Udoh; and renounce the free-agency rights to Derrick Favors, Dante Exum and Raul Neto.  Right, so now I've read it and found this.  Show me the team that's gonna take that $20m and then we can talk again.  It doesn't matter that Rubio's contract is a neutral asset - there just aren't teams with cap space that would want it."
"From http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15047018/how-nike-lost-stephen-curry-armour  &gt; James indeed has a lifetime contract with Nike worth more than $500 million, according to USA Today. He has a one-year deal with the Cavs, probably as a means of maximizing his profit and leverage. If that reporter had been allowed another subversive follow up, perhaps this question would have yielded interesting results: ""Who is your primary employer?""  &gt; ""Your primary employer is who pays you the most money,"" ESPN's Bomani Jones says. ""LeBron was Team Nike before he was a Cleveland Cavalier or a member of the Miami Heat or any of those things. We contextualize guys around the teams they play for because that's the relevant variable for the kind of work that we do.""  Makes perfect sense IMO "
I still say Kobe but recently I’ve also started saying Lebron JAMES like Chris Smoove a lil bit. 
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2781403-lebron-james-to-lakers-trade-rumors-lonzo-ball-is-the-one-constant-piece  “If LeBron James opts in to his $35.6 million player option for 2018-19, the Los Angeles Lakers may have to part with last year's No. 2 pick to acquire him.”"
"The full Haynes statement has hall-of-fame level hedging and qualifiers:  &gt; That’s a good question. **That’s something I haven’t been able to look in to**, but **I think** any deal that you’re looking to make, or you’re trying to make to bring in a big piece, Lonzo Ball is going to be in that. Lonzo Ball is going to be in that for sure. Obviously the Lakers are trying to rid themselves of Luol Deng’s contract. Ingram could be in play, I’ve heard Ingram’s name mentioned by some... The one constant that I’ve heard is Lonzo Ball. **I think anyway**, if LeBron were to come, **there probably** wouldn’t be a need for Lonzo Ball **because we know** how ball dominant LeBron James is, **so it’s still early in the process right now but as the days go on and as we get more and more information, we’ll start hearing more clearly on what those pieces could look like.**"
&gt; Edit: also some people on Twitter are saying it wasn't him so who knows  LeBron James has been spotted at the car rental counter at Logan Airport.
Cleveland's #1 Export - Lebron James
James Jones and Lebron* show some respect 
LeBron and James Jones
"The man was an athletic freak who's strength and physicality was lauded in an age of much more physical play by some of the greatest big men of all time. He won track and field competitions on the national stage in college and played other professional sports after retiring from basketball, as well as getting into weight lifting. This dude had the competitiveness of Michael Jordan and the athleticism of Lebron James...  The 500 pound bench number is a known exaggeration, but I would hesitate to doubt 400. Dwight Howard benched a bit over 350 at one point I believe?"
"I can’t disagree with you. I will say this though to hopefully add some clarity to the state of our fanbase:  JR holding that ball out at the end of regulation in game one against the Warriors is such a microcosm for LeBron’s Cavalier legacy and (it may be a stretch but) Cleveland sports teams in general.  We’ve missed our chance. LeBron James has become more than a generational player. In a lot of ways, he’s the greatest to ever play the game (we can talk MJ debates later, just roll with it for now). Not only does Cleveland line up to take him with an unlikely first pick, but he’s also from northeast Ohio. Who the hell comes from northeast Ohio, right!? We’ve done our waiting, we’ve had our heartbreaks, and we’ve endured our pathetic teams. Now it’s time to cash in. Now we get a turnaround. We get to be on top, as unlikely as it is. He left and came back. He’s now the complete player. Annnd we get steamrolled by the perfect sports organization riding the coattails of a perfect salary cap payroll. Fuck. What a wasted opportunity.  We’re supposed to win with LeBron and watch him cement his legacy as the greatest ever. He’s supposed to get 5 titles in 7 years with Cleveland and become undisputed and immortal. Damn. Not happening  What about the other teams? Browns; fuck nope. What a joke of an organization. Indians; great team. Great ball club in the last 25 years with three really good periods (mid-late 90’s, early-mid 00’s, and mid-current 10’s) and no World Series to show for it.  We’re emotional, bitter, jaded, degenerate, and unintelligent. We went all in on this guy. We’re a down and out, shrinking city, staying relevant outside of sports thanks only to a Great Lakes Port, I-90, and huge hospitals. We’re not Silicon Valley. We’d probably be okay with being the bad guys and switching roles with the Bay Area because we’ll take titles however we can get them. I think we’d rather win like villains than die like heroes at this point.  We’re also not very attractive as a bandwagon team, are we? So the Cavs flairs in here are MOSTLY locals. No rich history prior to LeBron. Some history, not rich though. So while plenty of other fans in here maybe don’t have their livelihood associated with their team’s success, most of us do. And it sucks because it didn’t have to be this way.  There’s a lot of irony in Kevin Durant joining the Warriors a la LeBron joining the Heat and creating the Heatles. If he didn’t directly inspire KD’s move - he very certainly enabled the plausibility of it. But that doesn’t mean the timing has to be so entwined that his return as the prodigal son is thwarted by another player embarking on the same super team journey. KD should be 5 years later and we’d all be happy as multi-title Cavs fans. It’d be great to have four finals against the Warriors and trade off each year turning the series into a series on top of a series. I know the neutrals and most everyone else would hate that but we’d like it. But, unless we somehow go back to back with LeBron in the next two seasons, our time is up. Our chance is gone and there’s nothing residual about LeBron’s success that we can ride once he’s gone. That’s it. That’s why we’re bitter, unintelligent, degenerates (myself most definitely included). You just have to deal with us until LeBron leaves Cleveland whenever that may be. Then we can cast ourselves away into oblivion; happily or otherwise."
"I’m not gonna trust that some unconfirmed twitter account who happens to really likes the NBA just so happened to see Lebron James at the fuckin zoo.  Plus, he seems like the type of dude to snap a pic if true."
"Bro, Lebron was a better player.   Kobe is top ten of all time, by most accounts people have Lebron James in their top three. "
"Why does Kawhi need the money? These players value money more than basketball. I'd be totally okay if the big bag was actually Lebron James. That makes sense, why would he want to share a team?"
I haven't watched a lot of basketball this season. But I think if Lebron James cloned himself then they would be great teammates. 
"Yuuuup, and honestly with LeBron about to be 34, you're giving me that 8th overall pick as well as James."

"He isn't a very vocal player because he plays on the warriors, but he's grown in his leadership and the warriors even said he was one of their biggest talkers in the post-season. This is a quiet motherfucking killer. He doesn't need to lead an offense right now but I believe he could with the right surrounding cast. I'm also going to repeat that Klay is not just a ""solid, if not above-average defender"". He is a top 3 perimeter defender in the NBA, rivaled only by Kawhi and Smart at this point. This is a man who guards the best perimeter player (nowadays that's often the best player on the team) on the other team every night, and he was doing it as the second offensive option until KD came in. You're nuts if you don't think a man who can guard LeBron James on the perimeter and very comfortably switch onto a player like Kevin Love in the post as the second best shooter of all time. I simply don't understand how people don't see it, I've been watching him since he was drafted by the warriors though, and I could see how it would be hard to notice just how dominant this guy is because of his surrounding cast combined with his demeanor, but calling him a solid defender is a huge understatement, this is hyperbole but it's like saying LeBron is a solid point forward. It's not wrong per se, but solid indicates ""good but nothing special"" in my mind. This dude is special."
The meme for the Rockets was better:  Chris Paul  Paul George  LeBron James  James Harden
The guy taking the picture is LeBron James 
What if you trade Hayward and picks for LeBron James? :D
"idk, i google searched ""shannon sharpe annoying"" and saw this post. im watching undisputed now on youtube. shannon sharpe has a hard on for lebron james, as usual."

"tbh, having anthony davis, lebron james, peak michael jordan and shaq would also help, but teams have somehow managed to win championships without any of these players in the past."
"Danny Green, Patrick Beverley, Doug McBuckets, Anthony Morrow, and Mirotic. Danny would love being next to LeBron. Guy can barely dribble and is made for 3&amp;D. Morrow at the very least could be the new James Jones for LeBron that comes in in hits some 3s every now and then. Mirotic would be good as a stretch 4 that would needed for any LeBron team. Beverley is obvious since he's a solid secondary ball handler and can play his natural role of 3&amp;D for the most part. Doug could be a good off the bench shooter. Morrow and Doug are probably the most realistic since they've been throw in fodder for the most part with no real value. Mirotic should be a given due to most teams not having money and Pelicans having Boogie/AD."
You're talking about affordability with Lebron James lmao!  Lebron has 2 houses in LA and his mega mansion in Cleveland. I don't think affordability is going to play a factor in his decision. 
KAWHI = SNEK CONFIRMED   GIVE ME GOLD KLAY  CHOCOLATE MILK  FUCK KD  FUCK ZAZA  CURRY SHOULD BE FMVP  LEBRON JAMES  Am I doing this right?
"I prefer the lineup of Chris Paul George, and Lebron James Harden. Make it happen Houston!!"
"Would a starting five with Josh Hart, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James and Nerlens Noel with Tyler Ennis, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Thomas Bryant, Ivica Zubac + some veteran minimum contracts (Brook Lopez, Channing Frye?) from the bench be a) possible and b) a contender? Not sure what has to happen with Luol Deng (waive and stretch?) and Lonzo (trade?) in that scenario, not a cap expert."
If you want Lebron James in La you are official bandwagon. Team Mamba wants no deal with James.  Bring PG and possibly Tyreke Evans. I also prefer Cousins but with Loul Deng contract in the way I dont wanna loose our young core for someone who has been injured last season.
I guess he is saying that their last names also work as first names so the team would have the lineup with the most first names.  Isaiah (he gone)  Thomas  Paul  George  Kawhi  Leonard  LeBron  James  Julius  Randle (idk if this is a first name)
"Of course they are shooters. But for example LeBron James, Dirk Nowitski, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, Karl Malone, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all scored over 30000 points. They are also all in the top 10 of career field goal attempts. "
"You can get stronger, and a bit quicker or faster, but getting significantly more athletic is a whole other thing.   There’s never been a prospect like Doncic at his age?? Lebron James? Excellent playmaker, insane court vision, 18 years old and 6’8. Doncic is a better shooter at this age, but Lebron was better at defense and had jump out of the gym athleticism. Also, Ricky Rubio was comparable at 18/19 too. Doncic was a better shooter than Rubio, but Rubio played better defense. But they were both superb passers/playmakers.   Seriously, when was the last time an 18-19 year old European player actually did amazing right off the bat in the NBA? Ayton has the potential to dominate his rookie year. "
"Honestly, I feel the Spurs didn’t offer him the Max contract...  He QUIT on his team. Kawhi has played years with teammates Parker, ginobili, Mills, Danny Green, Popovich, etc and he just abandon them. What type of person does this? Watched (or maybe not even) them lose to the Warriors. Would Jordan, James, Westbrook, injured but with a shot at playing, ever watch one of their teams go down like that? To not even be on the sideline...  You have to question his Character and Personality.   Speaking of Personality. His group probably feels he should get the endorsements, attention and notoriety of LeBron, Westbrook, Durant, Curry, etc. Going to LA isn’t going to help that much. Why? Kawhi has No Personality he’s way too quiet and boring AF.   But apparently him and his group say a ton by leaking his unhappiness out all year. You want to get traded, that’s fine. But don’t say it out loud and to LA. You lose total trade leverage and the Spurs aren’t going to do that. Nor should they. How stupid can him or his group be. (Unless he wasn’t offered the Super max contract and his group panicked. Which is what I think happened. Of course, That info wouldn’t get to the media as the Spurs wouldn’t do that. Lowers his trade value and its classless.)  He will be gone draft night. Popovich will get this nonsense out of the way. Some desperate team will think they are getting the next winning Superstar. When in actuality, your getting the opposite. A quiet, sensitive, paranoid diva who QUIT on his team.  Addition by subtraction for the Spurs.   Would love to see a Cousins, Jokic, Giannis, Porzingas, Gordon, come back in return.  "

"You're getting hammered with downvotes and I honestly don't know why, because you're right.

"&gt; 230   Alright, maybe me saying well over 15% may have mislead the conversation xD.  I wouldn't recommend him dropping to 230 straight. I'd push him to 250, as you say, and see how we go from there. 260 is still too much weight for today's nba.  But you're comparing him to Draymond Green while they look to be completely different players. Draymond never jumps unless he's going for the block and in those instances he uses more his insane positioning and wingspan. His knees don't suffer because he's a ""timing"" jumper more than a power one.  Zion has someone like Lebron James or Wall (wall smaller of course) to compare himself if we're talking about possible playstyle if you want him bumping against players to create space and those are very lean.  And again, i don't want him at 230 just yet. If he's at 17% bodyfat at 280 he can go to 240 without problem.  And Draymond is 230 Lbs while being more or less the same height."

Which ones do you put Larry over -- LeBron / KD / Stephen Curry / Kawhi Leonard / AD / James Harden 
"**[Rohrbach]** *Overheard on Laker nation instagram after LBJ's post: “He got me,” Kuzma said of Lebron Jr's number snatch on him. ""That f***ing LBJJ LIANGELO'D me."" Kyle added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times. He then said he wanted to add James Jr to the list of players he gives his number to in a future summer.* "
I was just thinking about that this morning. Is a team really going to pick a potentially average player just to get LeBron right before he’s about to retire? I mean we all know this is Lebron’s 5th prime but does he really have a 7th prime in him for when he’s pushing 40? At that point a team probably wants to draft for the future.   Unless you’re a struggling small market team that just wants to put butts in seats. In that case drafting the James boys makes a lot of sense. 
"You have inferior sports and an inferior lake. If it weren't for Lebron James and Astronauts, your state may as well not exist."

I’m not going to bash a guy for going for more money.  If you agree to work for someone and someone else offers twice as much money you say your sorry to the first group for wasting their time and effort and run towards greener pastures.  This is especially true the less money you make.  It’s not as if it’s Lebron James we’re talking about.  It’s the 7th or 8th best player on any given team.  Let the man be.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"But how great would it be if the Cavs drafted James Jr. and refused to sign Lebron, or trade James Jr. :)"
C'mon man. Lebron James. Demigod from Cleveland. Son of Sonics legend Delonte west. 
"LeBron has said that his all time favourite player was MJ, however he was inspired by Kobe and how he went straight to the NBA. It made him think he could do that too. Later on in the NBA he said up until 2009 I think that he felt Kobe was the best player in the world. After Kobe's retirement he said Kobe was the guy that inspired him to work hard, because every time he didn't feel like hitting the gym and working on his game, he'd tell himself that Kobe was out there working and getting better, and that he had to work just as hard to keep up.  Excerpts from the interview after Kobe retired: &gt; ""I wanted to be just like him, man,"" James said Tuesday.  &gt; ""In high school I wore a nappy afro because of Kobe Bryant,"" James said. ""I always said my inspiration came from Jordan, but I always thought Jordan was so out of this world that I could never get there. Kobe was someone that I just always kind of wanted to be like and play like. And then, just being a competitor, he took me to that next level, and understanding how important competition is and just have a willingness to never die.""  &gt; ""I knew I had to be better because of Kobe Bryant,"" he said. ""I knew he was in the gym and I knew he was working on his game. And I knew he was great. So every day that I didn't want to work out or every day I felt like I couldn't give more, I always thought of Kobe. I knew that he was getting better and I was like, `Man, if you take a day off, he's going to take advantage of it. You cannot take a day off. You cannot take a day off.'  &gt; ""And I used him for my motivation throughout my career because I always knew that he was working on something. So, that part will be missed a little bit.""  It's safe to say that he looked up to Kobe, yes."
"What's interesting is that most of the people rooted for the Cavaliers to win in 2016 when that team was built from free agency and extreme luck in the draft. The best player in the world bitched out once again the moment he saw the Heat getting older.  ""Fuck yeah Lebron James is coming home!""  Of course he is coming home. It's the best place for him bar none. Who else is capable of giving him a max without losing any other players? Who else has the ability to give him a superstar(Kyrie) in the making and then trade for another star(Love) with all the 1st draft picks they had?  The best fucking player in the world has 2 all stars with him along with a very capable bench. I expect him to win championship. Specially if he's in the fucking east.  ""But the pacers were competition. PG and the pacers are so fucking good."" Look at PG now. A second fiddle to WB and didn't even make the 2nd round. you think that competition is even comparable to the west?  Whereas the Warriors was built from draft and player development. None of their core 3 was drafted top 5 for fucks sake.  And even then the warriors had to battle against the war zone of the west. The fucking thunder and spurs alone is worth more than all the playoff contender in the east. Then you have the Clippers, the Rockets, even the Blazers.  But yes. Let's compare the 2016 championship to the 2011 mavericks. It's so fucking comparable.  My point is eat shit. The Warriors deserve to win all the championships they could get. All those 73-9, 3-1 jokes were so obnoxious. When they had to make it out of the west without any superstar free agent to help them and then battle the best player the in the world with 2 other allstars and the highest paid bench in the league."
"Man, I know most people are dumb, but it still somehow surprises me when I go to instagram or youtube comments and see shit like this;  &gt;slytherin2x24: You got no other option than winning a championship next year because if you dont then best is to walk away  Imagine actually typing that in response to LeBron James posting a video about him and his son."
I disagree with Spurs being 3rd seed. They are not better than Utah who has just as good of a defense and a better player (Mitchell). Spurs are also not better than OKC. With Roberson they are elite defensively as well and have better players.  Lakers are making the playoffs. Saying they won't means you were born yesterday and underestimate Lebron James.
"I agree Vegas had the Heat as favorites but the NBA community did not. It was all Lakers.   Here's another: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/660078-2011-nba-playoffs-predictions-odds-on-every-team-to-win-the-nba-championship#slide1  &gt;The Miami Heat are an amazing team. Every knows about the Big Three and LeBron James big move in the offseason, but this team is not even the best in the Eastern Conference.  Lebron never ruined parity and no one thought that. "
"If there was a next Lebron, we would know about them by now even if they were in elementary school. That player isn’t born yet .. whoever it is would have to be a 1 in a billion genetic singularity   I can remember seeing players like Curry at Davidson and Durant at Texas and saying “wow this is an unbelievable talent” but they were nothing like Lebron James. Just forget about seeing another player like him in your lifetime, it won’t happen"
B.  Good balance of expertise and attitude.  Try this **longboi** lineup  **PG:** LeBron James  **SG:** Kevin Durant  **SF:** Giannis Antetokounmpo  **PF:** Kristaps Porzingis  **C:** Joel Embiid
"It’s not close, klay is better shooting, better defense and can play off ball impeccably, oladipo has had one great season but his low efficiency doesn’t translate into playing off ball. In today’s nba unless you’re LeBron James, you need to be able to play off ball as well "
"Seriously, they got Lebron James in the offseason and half of them are more worried about Kobe’s legacy. They don’t deserve the King."
"Huh?  How about improving on that thought, spending some money and getting a superstar Death Lineup of Semi Ojeleye, Josh Huestis, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Zach Collins and LeBron James?"
"Slow down??? I crunched the stats using a weighted average for 3pt% 2pt% FreeThrow% I also did a weighted average for the steals, blocks &amp; turnovers then combined the two to see who was the best. I don't play games when It comes to basketball stats, I know my stuff. I haven't just yet crunched the stats for all the years so ""Best basketball player ever"" is a little much but ""the greatest shooter ever"" I'm sure of. My rankings for 2017-2018 goes as follows Stephen Curry,Karl-Anthony Towns,Kevin Durant,Klay Thompson,Kyrie Irving,Chris Paul,Nikola Jokic,Anthony Davis,Tobias Harris,Victor Oladipo,Khris Middleton,Jimmy Butler,LeBron James,Damian Lillard,James Harden . The 4 that suprised me were jokic, Tobias Harris, khris middleton, and jimmy butler, I knew everyone else was up there, oh and of course Kyrie is much more efficient that lebron and earned his spot. I'm a stat-head ."

LeBron James colluded with the 2nd best player in the world and another top 15 player in the 2009-2010 regular season to make a superteam. Then they took paycuts to do it.

It's funny because of how ridiculous it is to jump on a table to celebrate a win in the first round when you're LeBron fucking James and you've been in the NBA finals for the past 8 years. It should be nothing and yet he had a similar reaction to Kobe winning the NBA championship

"Per Zach Lowe:  &gt;Since Dallas fell into that 3-15 ditch, Nowitzki is averaging 14 points per game on very close to 50/40/90 shooting. Again, he can barely move. Teams still scrap their base pick-and-roll defense to account for his jumper. They'll switch little guys onto him, or send third defenders flying at him even if it leaves another Maverick open -- whatever it takes to prevent Dirk from launching.  &gt;A Nowitzki ball screen remains one of the game's most lethal plays. **The Mavs pour in 1.18 points per possession when Nowitzki sets a pick for a ball-handler, seventh among all high-volume screen-setters**, behind only Zaza Pachulia, LeBron James, Luke Babbitt, Channing Frye, Jordan Bell and Draymond Green, per Second Spectrum. (To review: three Warriors, the game's best player, a shooting big man who plays with the game's best player, and Luke Babbitt for some reason.) Only Marc Gasol, Robin Lopez and DeAndre Jordan have set more ball screens.  &gt;He's even setting up office hours at the center of the foul line again after shying away from post-ups early in the season.**The Mavs have scored 1.32 points per possession on any trip featuring a Dirk post-up, the fourth-highest mark among 81 guys who have recorded at least 50 post-ups, according to Second Spectrum.**  &gt;He is a key member of the Mavs' fittingly wacky Death Lineup: Nowitzki, Yogi Ferrell, J.J. Barea, Devin Harris and Dwight Powell -- still outscoring teams by an ungodly 19 points per 100 possessions. He's happy to sit during crunch time if the Mavs have a lead, and Rick Carlisle needs defense.  &gt;Dirk, forever.  This article was written this past January. Dude is still valuable.

James Harden is a shooting guard who handles the ball majority of the time.  LeBron James is a Small Forward who handles the ball majority of the time.  Ben Simmons is a Power Forward who handles the ball majority of the time.  See the trend?

"I think James Harden definitely deserved the MVP. But I think context is important. LeBron lost his number 2 and the Cavalier roster was absolutely gutted and swapped with completely new people and they finished out strong.  Harden had another star next to him, a rising star in Capela, and some huge role players. That rocket team was absolutely great. LeBron had to play in every single game and averaged career highs in assists and rebounds with better scoring efficiency.  "
"""is a winner"" doesn't mean anything. No one's comparing Kobe to Carmelo; Kobe's so much better than Melo it's not even worth discussing, and I'm not even sure why he was brought up. LeBron was absolutely not ""carried"" by Bosh and Wade in the way that Shaq carried Kobe to the first three. I'll walk back the word carry, b/c I feel like it implies Kobe did nothing, but those are first and foremost Shaq's rings. They might have won those rings if you switch out Kobe with a replacement-level 2-guard; there's no fucking way they would win them if you replace Shaq with a replacement-level center. These aren't really ""nitpicking"" at the little things; this is part of what makes these debates fun. When you get into all-time great debates like this, the difference between two players often comes down to what you call ""nitpicking"" but what are actually pieces of evidence for or against a player. The opposite of this is deploying smooth-brained, ESPNspeak nonsense like calling someone a ""winner"" or saying that a guy ""wanted it more"". Both teams played hard, man. Calling Kobe outside the top-ten is not ""turning my head"" to one of the greatest players ever. Kobe's between 10-15 of all-time; that's incredible. His portfolio is stellar, it is superb, it is one of the best ever and it is not nearly as impressive as what LeBron James has done. "
Wth. I've loved Kawhi since he slowed down LeBron James in the Finals and I was still extremely bothered by his actions. Dude was going full KD snek there.
"In all seriousness though: LeBron James, Mark Price, Kyrie Irving &amp; Austin Carr"
"I don't understand how much you have to dislike Kobe Bryant to put him outside of the top 10 best players.   Kobe Bryant is a winner. This isn't a guy who scored 30k points like Carmelo Anthony and led his team to nothing. This was a man who wanted individual recognition but also wanted to win at all cost. He may have been a selfish player but he did it to win and not to just pick up his own stats. The ""mamba mentality"" isn't something you associate with a guy who just goes out to showcase his individual ability but one that also goes out to be a winner. Reddit is a cancer when it comes to talking about Kobe Bryant. LeBron James was carried by 2-Future Hall of Fame players in Wade and Bosh and who cares. It doesn't take away from how amazing LeBron James is as a player. We can nitpick at the little things all day. Kobe Bryant can be debated as being better than LeBron James. He has a portfolio in every way to showcase how amazing he was. If you still want to act like he wasn't top 10 than good for you but you are just turning your head to one of the best players to ever play."
"i mean you got a player that no one knows if can even play for a guy who may of ""choked"" in the playoffs against lebron...i mean for 8 years any team that played James choked soo i mean its not really fair to say it was DD's fault they lost. If Kawhi plays good and stays then kudos to Toronto. But if he leaves the only thing they earned was a salary dump and made it a less desirable destination next year for superstars to go since the team clearly is about business.  "
"When Ginobli came in he was a nobody and Duncan let him play his game and blowup as big as he can. Not only did you never but could you imagine a teammate wanting a trade because they didn't want to play with Duncan? But LeBron got Love and Bosh as full stars and still didn't give them the freedom Ginobli got from the beginning. Guys who came in at Ginoblis level James didn't even give the time of day let alone build them up and let them shine as bright as him. When guys like Robinson and Elliott we're aging Duncan had enough confidence to stick it out and win more titles, he had enough belief in himself he didn't have to ring chase"
"Paul Pierce. Most recently, LeBron James."
"Only superstar? Lmao you gotta come out of your little bubble. Bautista and Donaldson are arguably as big of stars and they actually showed up and gave the team huge moments on the playoffs. There was a time you couldn't walk downtown without billboards plastered with Bautista's face everywhere and the Rogers Center was selling out for 2 straight seasons. Sebastian Giovinco probably has the greatest international reach out of any of the superstars in Toronto's history, brought them to their first finals appearance and got the first major trophy to the city in decades. Austin Matthews is well on his way to being one of the biggest stars in the league and we just got John Tavares in the city.  If you're talking strictly basketball, in terms of superstar as in the true word of stardom, I'd argue Vince Carter was more memorable to people in the league more than DD will be. DD doesn't have a moment like Vince Carter's slam dunk competition that gets plays every year. Chris Bosh was hand picked by LeBron James to go to Miami and they, along with Wade, were dubbed ""The Big 3"".  If yall don't get outta here with this pandering and get out of your feelings. Toronto has been getting much better in terms of attracting athletes and making them. "
Fucking LeBron. Fucking LeBron James. 
This man went from not being able to do a push-up to boxing out Lebron James with one weird trick-DOCTORS HATE HIM.
Lebron James is no longer in heat.
"i think it's clear that LeBron James is the best basketball player of all time; that is, he plays the game of basketball better than anyone who's ever lived. Wether or not it makes him the ""greatest"" NBA player of all time is a different conversation. but to my eye he is the best. "
[Maybe LeBron and KD want to make another rap song together.](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/06/05/lebron-james-kevin-durant-rap-song-audio-leaked)
"Having a good series against that terrible Wizards team doesn't make up for the many disappointments and under-performances from the past.  There is no excusing that Cavs series, either. That same Cavs team got taken to 7 by the Pacers, 7 by the rag-tag Celtics, and then swept by GSW. Just because LeBron James was on that team, it doesn't excuse the gutless performance. The Cavs just weren't good, yet the Raptors and DeMar embarrassed themselves against them. It was pretty obvious that the Raptors weren't going anywhere if they had to rely on Derozan again."
Kawhi could possibly end up on this list if he's hell bent on going to the Lakers. Hard to see him winning an MVP while being on the same team as LeBron James.
"He had a good series in the series before that, and had a bad 3 games after losing by very close margins to a team led by Lebron James. "
So Lebron James III
No particular order. Derozan is a guard with no 3 point shot and terrible defense. I'd take all of these players before Derozan.  1.	Lebron James 2.	Kevin Durant 3.	Stephen Curry 4.	Anthony Davis 5.	Kawhi Leonard 6.	James Harden 7.	Russell Westbrook 8.	Giannis Antetokounmpo 9.	Jimmy Butler 10.	Chris Paul 11.	Damian Lillard 12.	Kyrie Irving 13.	Karl-Anthony Towns 14.	Paul George 15.	Victor Oladipo 16.	Demarcus Cousins 17.	Lamarcus Aldridge 18.	Rudy Gobert 19.	Ben Simmons 20.	Joel Embiid 21.	Klay Thompson 22.	Draymond Green 23.	Al Horford 24.	John Wall 25.	Bradley Beal 26.

LeBron James Jr 
"Lebron ""Bronny"" James Jr."
LeBron isn't better than Michael Jordan. It can be debated but it can also be debated that Kobe Bryant was better than LeBron James for all of the Kobe Bryant haters.  Rings aren't the most important but they are somewhat important. LeBron isn't a better basketball player than MJ. 
"in the most literal sense ,everyone is tradeable. the question is what offer will it take to move them and how likely is it to happen?  if i were to offer you lebron james Brandon ingram and as many picks as you want for KD and filler i bet a GM would think about it before saying ""no KD's untradeable"" Realistically do i see this happening though? to any of those players? fuck no.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Buddy Hield.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched the Bahamian Bomber in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Buddy's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Steph Curry is better than Buddy Hield, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Buddy in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Buddy is better.  You might be jealous of Buddy's hair, or jealous of his status as the greatest smiler in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Buddy isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Buddy talk to the adults. Fair?"

"A few years back, a Boston beatwriter wrote a column about the Celtics needing to simply “wait out the storm” that was Lebron James. He wrote that it was fruitless hoping to beat him, that the franchise should instead stock up on players and wait for him to leave because again, beating him was a cruel joke.  And that’s what Boston and Philly did.  The firing of Casey was silly given that fact. Again there are a whole set of TWO teams in the playoffs over the last 8 years that haven’t gotten drowned in a bathtub by the man. He’s beaten a team with 3 future MVPS. He’s beaten 60 win teams. He’s beaten Rose, George, Thomas, The Big 3, And every other great that has come out of the East.   The Raps record was really no worse than anyone else’s. And honestly who cares if you can win 3 games and still lose the damn series??? Nobody was beating this man. So to fire a guy with so much success (and promise!) out of that team over a guy nobody could beat, again, was flat out stupid."
"Why Toronto won the trade: To win a NBA championship, you need to have 1 or more of the following: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard. The end. "
"What's so crazy? He said if you really want to convince LeBron, you'd be willing to trade Embiid(/Simmons?) for Kawhi. It's a huge leap of faith and I wouldn't do it either, but Windhorst was talking about what it would take for LeBron to consider them seriously. He's also not some Joe Schmo, he's proven historically to have insight particularly into lebron's camp. As they say, fortune favors the bold and apparently so does LeBron James."
"LOL for pinning their hopes and dreams on hometown boy Lebron James, the Cavs get shanked when he decides to go ring chasing in Miami. And then when he came back the entire city of Cleveland welcomed him with open arms. Also how many players sulk and pout and ask for trades from teams they originally signed contracts with?   It's ok when players turn their backs on teams, but it's absolutely vile when teams decide to sacrifice players to get better. "
"People here are overselling the consensus part, because his stats were so good.  He faced the same questions that Boogie did about empty stats. You can definitely argue against that, but it was questioned a lot so there wasn't consensus.  I think an example of it was West essentially vetoing the Love for Klay trade. A lot of people thought that was crazy. Some didn't.  http://grantland.com/features/kevin-love-lebron-james-trade-minnesota-timberwolves/  The fact is it got secured a lot from both sides."
"&gt; Accolades...  Mutombo, Rodman, Olajuwon and Mourning played in the same era, effectively eating away each others accolades. That's 4 guys that you can easily say were more impactful as defenders than Kawhi has ever been. And for Payton to win one in the middle of those beasts' prime should mean something too. Then there's Wallace, who was able to keep prime Shaq to ""just"" 26/10 in the finals and during the early 2000's was *the* defender. That's 6.  &gt; Competition...  MJ is definitely better, Scottie and Kawhi is closer but I'm being biased if I go and bluntly say Scottie was better. Scottie did play during the era of the first 5 I mentioned AND Jordan, there wasn't much DPOYs for him to win behind them. But if you drop Kawhi to early to mid 90's and he isn't winning DPOYs either.  &gt; Eye test...  You can make a highlight defensive video out of any superstar player. Hell you could make one from James Harden. Picking and choosing the single moments when a player plays well isn't much of an eye test. Not saying Kawhi isn't a lock down defender or that he didn't absolutely put LeBron to school during those finals but still, highlight reel means nothing."
LeBron James
It's also harder to tell the differences in talent. A 250 yard drive doesn't look all that different from a 350 yard one. A Lebron James breakaway dunk is on a different planet compared to a WNBA break away funk that happens a couple times a year
Second spectrum has him at a lower avg speed than most other stars  https://stats.nba.com/players/speed-distance/?sort=AVG_SPEED_OFF&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=GP*GE*50:MIN*GE*30  and I believe more of his off ball production came in transition than in the halfcourt last season.   &gt;hes way ahead of other all stars that dont catch heat  like? I don't think there's any double standard with LeBron James of all people going on here.
Yeah this would be huge in the sports and nutrition community learning about what one of the goat athletes eats and doesn’t eat. If they did a small mini series on the science of lebron James chances are it’ll have more viewers than a WNBA championship. 
LeBron James doesn’t even have a career high quadruple double.....pathetic....  (Not counting turnovers)
Who would win? LeBron James or a bunch of reddit bois?

Lebron James in the year 2045
ever since the 2015 season we've only lost to a lebron james -led team.    Dawg whats so hard to understand about matchups. Ok so we got swept by the cavs the past 2 seasons but in turn we also beat wizards and bucks in 6. Does that mean they'd also be swept by the cavs if they played them? Probably not. Does indiana and boston taking the cavs to 7 games mean that they will also sweep the raptors if they played them instead? Probably not. 
Rajon Rondo Lance Stephenson  LeBron James Michael Beasley Javale McGee 
"KD guarded Jrue because he was the most 3 sized guy in their Rondo/Moore/Jrue/Mirotic/AD lineups. They wanted Draymond/Klay guarding Mirotic/Rondo depending on the game. KD started on Harden because there’s a lesser size mismatch which allowed Klay to start on CP3 and it forces the other teams to use screens to get the matchup they want which uses up shot clock. KD was on Gordon often after the CP3 injury or during second unit time and just let him shoot without contests over and over. He may have started on Harden but he rarely finished on him, partially because of how bad he is at fighting through even weak screens. His boxing out for defensive rebounds in that series was also poor against his matchup when the Warriors went small, PJ Tucker.   Having tools isn’t the same as using those tools. It’s like how teams don’t post up James Harden. You’re playing into his tools while you could just keep him in a position where he ball watches and you get open looks. His problem was being extremely lazy on defense, even in the postseason.  Also LeBron isolated against KD a lot in game 1 and it went pretty well for him, especially since he was hitting jumpers when KD would sag off of him. Leading this series is blocks doesn’t mean much since neither team utilizes shot blockers except Javale.    Those 5 man defensive lineups have Draymond in them which is why they’re so good. "
"Lebron James adds more to a team's offense due to his control of the game and passing ability. But KD can be considered harder to guard because he's more versatile and can shoot over you easier. From the team perspective, Lebron is worse because he can do things on a team wide level, but for the one guy trying to stop KD from scoring on him, KD is tougher to guard"
"This is a tough one.   1. Lebron James  2. Brian Scalabrine  3. Magic  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Kevin Durant  Honorable Mentions: Paul George, Kyrie Irving"

Lebron James (Every season)
" unless you're literally Dwight Howard I have serious doubts. Lebron  James is one of the greatest athletes on the planet, I'm not sure any experience in regular sports even remotely compares to him charging into you at game speed over and over with no recovery and no padding. Without even a helmet you'd be looking at crazy concussions. I don't believe anyone on this sub would last through day 1."
Lol I have no expectations of winning it all or even winning the WCF but the amount of people who think the Lakers don't have a chance to make the playoffs is baffling. We're a 35 win team that added Lebron James. I'd say we are probably more in the 6-8 range on this list though. Portland and New Orleans should be in the mix as well. I think 3-10 in the west could literally be any combination of the 3-8 listed here plus Portland and New Orleans. 
"&gt;he just didn't need to resort to being forced into making those shots as much.  While I absolutely agree with this, it should be pointed out that this was before the pace and space analytics revolution we've seen basketball undergo. Look at how rare it is now for teams to have more than one or two people on the floor who are not legit 3-pt threats. Some teams have all 5 players be good enough from 3 that you don't want to leave *any* of them open.   If Kobe was playing like this *now* you'd be wondering why he wasn't drawing all that attention and then kicking it to a teammate for a wide open 3. But back then three-pointers were still very underutilized, and teams might only have one guy out there that the defense absolutely didn't want to leave open. So as a result Kobe was often left with choosing between taking a toughly contested shot himself or passing it to teammates who were mediocre shooters who may have been open but would probably take a long two pointer.   Back then the thought was to build a championship team you needed a lot of size, rebounding, and defense to surround someone like Kobe with. If he was playing nowadays I am sure they would build a team around him by providing him with tons of shooters who could benefit from all of the attention he drew defensively, just like LeBron, James Harden, or Steph.  "
Except for that LeBron James is on the team dude. LeBron will not miss the playoffs.

"It's not a hot take, it's just clickbaity af with no actual news or contribution to the discussion. The headline doesn't follow at all from the facts. ""Shaping up"" implies that something has happened or is happening to change the status quo, which is already ""The Lakers hope to sign Kawhi Leonard"".  Instead, the article basically says this: the Lakers hope to sign Kawhi Leonard. **Recent reports indicate he still wants to play in LA** (this part is especially funny because it directly contradicts the headline). *But let's say he doesn't*. That will be bad for them! Now let's float out some highly speculative, unlikely potential signings with zero updates on the likelihood of them happening. This means things are shaping up horribly for them, because these unlikely scenarios that they're not banking on are still unlikely, just like before.  Jimmy Butler? Oh, err,  &gt; If Butler is interested in star power the Lakers have a pretty nifty all-star leading the squad. **Momentum, however, has Butler going east.**  lmao according to what? rumors in August about the Knicks?  &gt; If Leonard does reject the Lakers, fans will have to settle for another year of LeBron James, maturing youngsters and spare parts.  His closing statement here does not follow from what he presented in the article, *at least* because his point on Jimmy Butler was laughably weak. This article would make sense if reports like ""Kawhi likes Toronto"" and ""Jimmy Butler shuts down idea of playing in LA"" came out this week.

“Well it was either that or have LeBron James charge into me 200 times a day for 2 weeks”  “Ok......”
you ever heard of LeBron James?
"Its not just KD's scoring.  Its his defense.  KD is a legit top10 defender right now.  He is basically the ideal stretch 5 on defense. He was top5 in blocks and can switch on point guards.  He started in the playoffs against James Harden and Jrue Holiday.  How many other 7 footers can do that?  Guy finished 9th in DPOTY.  KD is also a very good playmaker also.  He averaged 7.5 assists in the Finals. And was top5 in assists for a non-PG in the regular season.  At this point KD is the superior scorer, shooter and defender. Lebron has the edge on playmaking. But scoring/defense is more valuable.  If it wasn't then Rondo would be a max player right now.  And since Lebron has dropped off so hard on defense its even more obvious."
"Id love to watch ~5 minutes of an Eric Andre type skit where Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James run around town defending random actions.   Boxing some lady out of a post office.   Slapping a can of tomato juice out of someone's hand before they put it in the buggy.    Stealing a pumpkin out of someone's hand and sinking it into a trash can from 30 feet."
"Just thinking about the people who would shy away from charges in charge drills back in HS and then the coaching staff forcing them to go back to back even longer since they are acting scared. I think I'd take jail for 18 months at least then you have a fighting chance to preserve your body. 14 days of 200 charges per day would damn near kill a man when its Lebron James coming at you.   Another brutal drill that would be interesting with LBJ, would be when your coach rolls the ball down the court, blows the whistle, and two people have to run full speed and dive for the ball at the same time trying to get possession. That one was BRUTAL and probably would not fly in todays athletic environment for high school."

Not really of course his numbers are gonna go down playing with Lebron James and up until this season Kyrie Irving
"Plus it's a much better story. ""I once drew 2800 charges from LeBron James in a two week period."" versus, ""I spent a year and a half of my life in prison."" "
Every one of LeBron's teammates gets trashed so that it looks even more impressive when LeBron succeeds. If the Lakers lose in the first round prepare to hear how Lonzo and Ingram are would-be busts whose careers were saved through the grace of our lord and savior LeBron James.
"KD is miles better off ball.  Its not even close.  Lebron may be a good cutter but he rarely does it so it does not matter. Fact is Lebron dominates the ball thus his Star teammates are marginalized.  Look at Love, Bosh, and Wade.  While Stars flourish with KD.  Last year Steph had his most efficient scoring season ever.  Klay has his career high points per game, 3FG%, 2FG%, and FG% while playing with KD.  KD's defense is miles better than Lebron.  That's a fact.  KD was 9th in DPOTY.  He is an elite rim protector and was top5 in blocks. He also can switch 1-5 on pick and roll.  In the playoffs he started on James Harden and Jrue Holiday. Tell me the last time Lebron started against an elite PG/SG in the playoffs?  The gap in defense is MASSIVE.  KD is a much much much better scorer.   KD is a better 3 point shooter, much much better mid-range shooter, and much better free throw shooter.  KD is better than Lebron on every single spot on the floor except the restricted area. KD shots 75.8% FG in the restricted area and Lebron shots 76.6% FG.  Outside the restricted area Lebron shot 36.7% last year on 52% TS.  Those are WEAK numbers.  While KD shot 48.2% FG on 61% TS outside the restricted area. This ability to score efficiently every where makes KD a much more deadly scorer and provides much better spacing for his teammates.  While Lebron's weak shooting forces his teammates into bad spots and also forces Lebron's teammates to be able to shot 3's to give Lebron spacing.  KD has also been much more efficient the last 3 years.  TS% last 3 years: 63.4%, 65.1% and 64.0%.  Lebron was at 58.8%, 61.9%, 62.5%.  That gap of 3.1% in TS% is massive.   Drop Lebron's 2016 TS% by 3% and he is below league average.  And what is more shocking is the ENTIRE OFFENSE is built around Lebron to hide his weaknesses and emphasize his strengths. While KD had to fit into the Warrior offense.  The entire offense was built around Lebron to make up for his below average shooting. Thus we see Kevin Love camping outside the 3-point line so Lebron can attack an empty paint.  We also see Lebron surrounded by a ton of 3-point shooters so a team can't double team him.  Lebron is a better INDIVIDUAL playmaker. But is that really important?  Is it really important to have one player dominate the ball and average 9 assists per game?  I don't think so. Having one player dominate the playmaking is an obsolete and inferior style of basketball. Much better is having a motion offense with superior ball and player movement. The type of system KD plays in. Yes he won't put up the gaudy assists numbers but it results in a far superior offense.    In summary KD is the better shooter and more efficient scorer.  Much better rim protector, off ball defender, team defender, and perimeter defender. He is the equal rebounder (Lebron averaged only 0.5 more contested rebounds per game then KD last year) and fits much better with other Stars and is 10x better of the ball.  Lebron is the superior individual playmaker. But that advantage means very little because that is an INFERIOR style of basketball ( 1 guy dominating the playmaking)."
"Wouldn't be that hard to develop, no? I mean OPS+ and ERA+ are just weighted relative to the average of that year, where the 100 is set to average. So a wRC+ of 150 in 1958 means you created 50% more runs than an average player in 1958.       Kobe had a 58 TS% in 2006-2007. The average of all 458 players that season was around ~.525.         Calculating it the same was as OPS+ (player's stat / all player average) * 100, you get Kobe with a 110 TS+. Kobe was a 10% better shooter than the average player in 2006-2007.           EDIT: Here's Kobe's career TS+ since '99.    1999-2000: 107 TS+   2000-2001: 109 TS+   2001-2002: 108 TS+   2002-2003: 109 TS+   2003-2004: 109 TS+   2004-2005: 110 TS+   2005-2006: 108 TS+   2006-2007: 110 TS+   2007-2008: 110 TS+   2008-2009: 106 TS+   2009-2010: 103 TS+   2010-2011: 104 TS+   2011-2012: 103 TS+   2012-2013: 110 TS+   2013-2014: 96 TS+   2014-2015: 92 TS+   2015-2016: 88 TS+       So Kobe at his peak was 10% better than league average. Here are some guys from last year (2017-2018) using this metric:      Klay Thompson: 111 TS+   Giannis Antentokoumpo: 111 TS+   Kyle Lowry: 111 TS+   Damian Lillard: 110 TS+   Jimmy Butler: 110 TS+   Jayson Tatum: 108 TS+   Victor Oladipo: 107 TS+   Khris Middleton: 107 TS+   Joel Embiid: 106 TS+         James Harden had a 114 TS+     LeBron James had a 115 TS+   Steph Curry had a 125 TS+   Rudy Gobert had a 121 TS+    Russel Westbrook had a 97 TS+    Donovan Mitchell had a 100 TS+, he was exactly an average shooter.        EDIT 2:    Wilt Chamberlain had a 134 TS+ in 1967.    Kareem had a 122 TS+ in 1976-77.   Jordan had a 117 TS+ in 1989-1990.     Shaq had a 118 TS+ in 2001-2002.     Tyson Chandler had a 132 TS+ in 2010-2011. Limited to just comparing against centers, it's 127. My man took 0 three pointers lol        Either way, based on this, you could say:      100-104: OK shooter   105-109: above average shooter   110-114: pretty good shooter   115-119: great shooter    120-124: excellent shooter   125+: Elite, best of the best.            "
"KD is better.  But fans and media are always late to the game. They will always overrate the elder statesman. Same thing happened when Lebron was the best in the world but most of the media/fans still said Kobe was the best.  FACT:  KD is an elite defender.  He was top 5 in blocks and is an elite rim protector. He can also switch on Point guards. He started against James Harden and Jrue Holiday in the playoffs. He was 9th in DPOTY voting.  Lebron is the exact opposite. His defense was absolutely horrible.  FACT:  KD is the better and more efficient scorer. The last 3 years KD has shot better from 3FG, Mid Range, and the free throw line. He also has had a higher TS% then Lebron the last 3 years and for his career.   FACT:  KD players better with other Stars then Lebron.  This is because KD is elite off the ball.  Curry had his most efficient scoring season last year with KD.  Klay scored his career high points per game, FG% and 3FG% while playing with KD.  Look at Bosh, Wade, and Love.  See how they got marginalized playing with Lebron.  FACT:  KD has come up big in the biggest moments in the Finals the last 2 years.  Lebron has not.  Both Game3's at home Lebron has come up short and small.  While KD hit the biggest shots and put the series away."
"Put KD on the Cavs and how many games do they win? How far do they go in the playoffs(if they even make it there). You might say LeBron doesn't play defense but he does, but you only see the plays that he takes off (which is annoying not going to lie). But if you really take KD over LeBron James you are out of your mind. LeBron is one of the greatest leaders ever and he will bring any team to the playoffs/finals. If KD ever even wants to be in the same sentence as LeBron he needs to leave the warriors and win a championship somewhere else because personally I'm not counting these chips for kd when it comes to his legacy"
You're right I didnt realize the nba has been around for over 70 years and lebron was James Naismith's protege
"""Exclusive 1on1 Fitness and survival training with Lebron James"" would draw some attention I suppose."
LeBron James 
Also one year ago today: Cavs agree to deal Lebron James to Los Angeles Lakers 
"Yes, healthy Kawhi Leonard is better than LeBron James"
"Fire burns, water is wet, and Lebron James is still the best basketball player on earth."
"There's no case for anyone going into this coming season, just depends on if LeBron can keep his prime going into next year, Idk what step Anthony Davis can take forward outside having a better team/system lessening his load so he can be healthy for the playoffs/succeed.  Durant will never be better than LeBron except when he declines (James), and I can see Leonard taking a leap if healthy, he only showed us 2 years of superstardom, I think he has the most potential to showcase more."
"The usual argument runs like this: he doesn't have the defensive ability that James and Durant have and he is a system player.  The first objection seems the worst of the two. Curry is good when he is on other guards (see Harden WCF) and not on bigs; how is this surprising? What happens when bigs are on Curry? He stomps on their throats. He's not a Chris Paul type of player but who cares; any defensive deficiencies he might have are easily outweighed by his offensive impact on the game.  Second: how can we even say that he's a system player? We really can't. He can beat you on the inside, beat you in the midrange and absolutely tear you apart on the three point line. He can't bully his way to the rim like Lebron can but he's finishing ability is underrated imo. Surround him with a shooter and a defensive SF (like Barnes) and even David Lee. You get the same Curry (maybe slightly worse results). If he had to run through this years East like Bron did, he would have made the finals faster.  I'm sure you know analytics better than me (I'm mainly a hockey/baseball guy for advanced metrics) but I'm getting into basketball. The Curry gravity effect is real; but it's hard to quantify. The only real way that I've heard of is that his teammates shooting percentages sky rocket. What other player in the history of the game needs to be guarded at 35 feet out? It's simply unreal.   I've said it before and I'll say it again: Curry does not get enough credit. He's spearheading one of the greatest dynasties of all time. That 2017 team will end up being the greatest team of all time . I know it's hard to compare eras but really? Jordan's Bull's? James' Heat would be a good battle but in the end I don't think they would really stand a chance."

"At think at this point they should just go with what happens. It sounds kinda weird but as I see there are two major factors that are unknowns:  1. What exactly is the team without Lebron James? How good are they? Playoffs? I think they hit playoffs in the 5th-8th range. That might be worth it for them.  2. What are teams offering for Kevin Love? If no deal is good enough, you keep him. But if someone is willing to offer something decent, then you can make a decision.  Both of these seem to be out of their hands I think at the moment."
"Good point. Now that I think about it, the Maverick Carter, Rich Paul, Randy Mims arrangement for LeBron James makes so much sense. Empower your childhood friends and help them establish themselves while being a part of that journey as well."
How wouldn't their styles mesh? Lebron James is like Scottie Pippen V.20. Lebron and Jordan on the same team would be the best team in the league.   Lebron took to the finals:  Larry Hughes 	 Zydrunas Ilgauskas	  Drew Gooden	  Eric Snow	  Donyell Marshall	  Damon Jones	  Ira Newble	  Scot Pollard	  Sasha Pavlović 	 David Wesley	  Shannon Brown	  Anderson Varejão	  Dwayne Jones	  Daniel Gibson	
"LeBron James is unguardable in the iso, if you can recall back to the 2018 playoffs"
"So who would you take..  Player A: 22 pts, 5.5 ast, 3.3 rb, 46% shooting and 39% from 3  Player B: 20 pts, 5.0 ast, 4.4 rb, 46% shooting and 35% from 3  Remember Kyrie played with Lebron James. Every star who's teamed up with Lebron had a decrease in statistical production just because he dominates the ball. "
"Boogie does not elevate his teams like other stars do. He loses on the kings, and it takes him a while to make an impact on the Pels. They were fine without him anyway. He makes his offenses worse because he dominates the Ball like a PG. his efficiency can be questionable. He has a huge attitude. He is turnover prone. And he doesn’t play defense. Kawhi Leonard is closer to Jimmy Butler than LeBron James. He is an A mistaken for an A+."
"So can Jimmy Butler. Kawhi Leonard is Closer to Jimmy Butler than LeBron James. I think he is an A mistaken for an A+. Great player, not better than KD or LeBron James."

"PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: LeBron James  PF: Corey Maggette  C: Bismack Biyombo  Bench: Henderson, Moon, and Thomas  I’d say 60+ wins and a championship tbh. "
So imperative that LeBron James didn't lmao not saying it's not important but evidence tells me imperative is not the right word
"The cavs started that game with the lineup: Derrick Rose-Dwayne Wade-Jae Crowder-Lebron James-Kevin Love  If someone had told me in 2011 that lineup would form, I'd wonder how many rings they'd win."
"I'm going to hijack this thread if you don't mind OP, to make this about LeBron James.  How absolutely fucking ridiculous that this guy made 8 straight finals!? The Raptors added a top 5 player to a 59 win team, and they still aren't the favourites to make the finals.   Not only was LeBron the favourite every year to make the finals, he actually did it. With or without a healthy supporting cast. God damn!"
Man you're a Spurs fan. Every year you had people still say that Duncan was gonna decline and yet he never really did. You know first hand that he was very smart with how he and Pop handled both his energy and his minutes during his career so he could go off when it matters.   LeCoast is a joke for a reason. The man has saved tons of mileage on his body over the years. Having to go harder in 10-15 extra regular season games is not gonna drain LeBron James and I'm not going to count small things like that against him until he shows even the slightest hint of regression.

"LeBron choking was a take that Skip paraded after the series until Mark Cuban shut him down on TV.   I cant believe we're just parroting the same thing as skip, especially after james came out this year and talked about how he was a flawed player back in ~~2014~~ 2011 and Dwane Casey's defensive scheme that shut him down then, made him into the player he is now.   Like the player himself is telling he didn't choke the other team just had a better defensive strategy against them."
"Problem with that is that football and basketball are as far from each other as possible in terms of superstar impact.      Simply speaking - in basketball having 1 amazing player (ie. LeBron James) and 4 bad players is better than having 5 decent players. It's not the same in football. Football is much more luck and mistake prone, one mistake or a bad luck in basketball game means losing 2-4 points out of ~100 your team will lose. One mistake or a bad luck in football means you can lose a goal and on average there are like 2-3 goals each game, so the value of not making mistakes is much higher.      It's much much harder for one superstar on the football pitch to have an impact even remotely close to a superstar on a basketball court."
"I don't think either is remotely defensible but okay.   We're talking about LeBron James, right?"
"Ours that is most polarizing right now is the ""post anything about LeBron James"". There's part of the sub who are so thankful for LeBron that they keep updating everyone on his life/past accomplishments (I Promise school was a valid post) and then there's the part of the sub that appreciates LeBron but realizes he isn't on the Cleveland Cavaliers anymore so he isn't relevant to the sub anymore. It's actually gotten quite popcorn worthy at times. "
Not op but [this bleacher report article ](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/37846-lebron-james-what-if) says he recorded a 4.40 so realistically with enough training I’m sure he could shave .1 off that.

"Jordan at that point had far transcended being a mere famous superstar athlete. He was on a level beyond, a true global cultural icon the likes of which even Steph curry and LeBron James haven't been able to reach. Combine that with 2 threepeats and his interim retirement, and the 90s Bulls blow the Warriors out of the water in terms of narrative and overall popularity. People were watching the greatest player of all time in the history of the sport at his very peak. Doubt something like that gets replicated again for ages."

"Kevin Love is almost exactly the same height as Lebron James I would bet for a difference of less than half an inch.  Kevin Love listed height: 6'10. Lebron James listed height: 6'8.  I would think that both are 6'8 without shoes, but not sure about that."

"The two best passers in the league and LeBron James in one graphic, nice. "
His voice reminds me of a combination of Derrick Rose and LeBron James.
"Lebron is obviously saying more than the headline, come on:  &gt; ""We got a long way to go to get to Golden State,"" James said when asked if the Lakers can challenge the two-time defending champs. ""They can pick up right where they left off, starting with training camp. ... We are picking up from scratch so we got a long way to go. We can't worry about what Golden State is doing. ... They've been together for a few years now.""  &gt; ""We are all new to each other, we have to take our bumps and our bruises,"" James added. ""There are going to be good times and bad times. If we continue to work the process and continue to sacrifice for one another and put in the commitment and time to being great, everything else will fall into place."""
"&gt;Lowry-FVV-DeMar-OG-Ibaka  Jonas was getting minutes and started vs. Cleveland, FVV was injured and wasn't playing the best he could both sides, Ibaka was constantly getting torched by Love and James outside of game 1. In the past years they were even worse on defense (on paper) when facing LeBron and the Cavs. Also Raptors constantly struggled with defense against the top 10 teams in the league, and it was mostly due to the starters. Lowry/OG can do his best on defense yet it still wouldn't be big enough to make a drastic change. Poeltl and Delon are decent defenders too with their tools/length but it goes the same with them.  &gt;and he isn't any worse than what Dirk used to be like.  Dirk was probably the only liability on defense for the 2011 Mavs.   And my point is that Dallas was filled with good defenders, Casey is still a top coach in the league but he can't make average/bad defenders good like he tried with Derozan and Jonas."

Me in 2018: “LeBron James plays for the Lakers.”
"""What's my answer?"" - LeBron James"
"if you put your penis in a cup, it becomes a penis cup  lebron james"
"Better in terms of talent, as kyrie said.  Cleveland literally only had 2 other guys that were good, and fortunately for them they had kyrie to play with.  Boston has very good players from 1-8, creating a more balanced team with a wider range of talent.  Lebron James is miles better than anyone on either side, I get it, but after that it’s all green, with Kevin love falling somewhere in the middle of it.  Edit: also better in terms of; in 3 years the star power forward wouldn’t regress into half the player he used to be and the superstar didn’t have a contract expiring."
This is an important question so either one of you can answer if you'd like. Would you rather guard LeBron James or two Isaiah Thomas' stacked on top of one another?
"Cool, really unnecessary to bring advanced stats into this but okay.  Celtics still currently have a better TEAM.  Any team with Lebron James is going to be successful, but that’s not what kyrie is talking about.  Boston 1-12 is better than Cleveland’s 1-12 overall."
"Sure, but that's not proof the LeBron James System can beat High IQ teams. One time (2013 Spurs) LeBron was playing in an actual system, not the LBJ system. Another time (2016 Warriors) I really don't want to get in to the specifics of that, but it came down to one possession in a game 7. I stand by my statement that the LeBron James system cannot beat *talented* High IQ teams. For right now, that means the Celtics, the Warriors, and maybe, maybe the Jazz. "
"Suprised you haven't been downvoted to hell like me.  I agree completely. I think the LeBron James System is good for beating bad - good teams . But against good teams with high bball IQ, they always beat him (Mavs, Spurs, Warriors). I think LeBron would have a lot more rings had he played in a system. Hell, he'd probably be 8-1 if he actually played in a system with a high IQ team.  Hopefully he changes that with the Lakers but I  don't see it. LeBron wants to go between the legs and run with the Warriors instead of playing in the post, controlling the tempo and saving his energy. As long as he does this I don't see him winning another ring."
"I'll clarify for you. I'm not trolling. Idk whenever someone goes against popular opinion people question the seriousness of the conversation. People can't fathom that someone has a different opinion.   I said I value winning over individual records, and my top 15 is comparing resumes. I gave serious and in depth responses only for people to react emotionally. All because I said LeBron James is #6 on my all time list.  I don't know anybody who would rather lose than win. If you gave LeBron James the option between 8 straight NBA Finals (and lose five) or three more rings to his resume, LeBron would choose 3 more rings. If you ask Steph Curry would he choose 73 wins or the 2016 championship, he would say the championship in a heartbeat.   Why is it a troll to say that winning matters over just going to the Finals? Nobody wants a finals loss on their resume. And I know for damn sure LeBron doesn't want 6 finals losses. Actually, I think LeBron would take being 3-0 over being 3-6 if you were to ask him privately, but that's my opinion."
1) Allen Iverson      2) LeBron James      3) Wilt Chamberlain      4) Derrick Rose      5) Kyrie Irving      6) Lance Stephenson      7) Magic Johnson      8) Joel Embiid      9) Carmelo Anthony   10) Steph Curry 
"This is the last time I'll reply because I'm getting tired of this. I hold 2015 against LeBron because injuries are a part of the playoffs and he didn't win. Just like how I hold 2016 against Steph Curry because injuries are a part of the playoffs and he didn't win. Losing will never be an accomplishment in my book.  &amp;#x200B;  And it kind of annoys me that people are making excuses for a grown ass man claiming to be chasing Jordan. All time greats don't get excuses. Going to the finals 8 straight times is an great accomplishment, but he's lost 67% of the time. Knocking LeBron James out of that #6 spot is going to be hard, damn near impossible for new players coming into the league. But I can't say that I would take LBJ over Jordan, Magic, Kareem, or Bird. I'd personally take him over Russell, but Russell has the resume to back up being top 3.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  At the end of the day it's my list. Hopefully you see me being objective and don't try to call me a hater, because I like LeBron James. I'm perfectly fine with LBJ being your top 2. I believe any player in the top 15 has the right to call themselves the GOAT. But when I look at them, LBJ is #6. No hate for the man, it is what it is  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;"
"So from what we're being led to believe, this coming season LeBron James will be playing off ball and at a fast pace. Next we'll be told he'll be living in the paint."
is that another accolade that lebron james has been snubbed on?
"Sigh. Rings are important but they aren't everything. Has Sam Jones ever won a scoring title, be MVP, or anything like that? Exactly. How many rings does Robert Horry have? I don't know and don't really care, because Horry never lead his team to a championship.  LeBron has an impressive resume, which has earned him #6 on my list. I think the other five happen to be more impressive and have less blemishes on their resume.  LeBron will probably pass Kareem on the scoring list, rack up all the assist and rebounds, which I take into account. But everyone just ignores 2011 like it didn't happen. LeBron, at this stage of his career, should not have been swept. He should've at least got one game. Beyond that, 2018 has shown me he isn't that good of a leader. But he is still #6 on my all time list. That isn't an insult. I'm from Cleveland, I grew up a Browns Bengals and Cavs fan, I'm just being real.   Steph Curry's finals record might be better than LeBron's when he retires, but he still won't have the resume that LeBron has.  LeBron James is an excellent player, he brings more to the floor than Steph Curry, and definitely more than Sam Jones.  But he would be top 3 on my list if it wasn't for his behavior during the finals and the fact that he isn't a good leader.   If you think I'm being nitpicky then I am, because you have to when you're discussing the Greatest of All Time. Curry right now is top 25-30, maybe he'll be top 15 when he retires, and he's my favorite player to watch. But I can't just launch him to the top 10 just because I like him, that's not how it works."
LeBron James is the greatest basketball player to ever live. 
"Yes brother 2016 was impressive. If I really wanted to I could argue all day about what happened and why the Warriors should've won or whatever, but at the end of the day, LeBron won a ring. But don't forget that he didn't do it by himself.   &amp;#x200B;  The story isn't ""LeBron overcame a 3-1 deficit vs a 73-9 team with three all stars"", it's ""LeBron overcame that team \*with Kyrie Irving\*.  People seem to forget that the Cavs in 2016 were considered a super team, with Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving and LeBron James. In 2016, Steph Curry was considered the best player in the world with two good role players. But it is what it is."
1. Lebron James 2. Shaq 3. Kyrie 4. Kevin Durant 5. Russell Westbrook 6. Kobe Bryant 7. Steve Nash 8. Dirk Nowitzki 9. Allen Iverson 10. Tim Duncan
"Read my other comments for Bird and Russell. Magic is just as great as Bird in my opinion. Magic is the only person to win a high school championship, a college championship, and a NBA championship within 4 years of each other. Magic also led his team to the finals with 3 different coaches. 5x champion. Magic Johnson and Stephen Curry are the only superstars that other superstars wanted to play with. Also, Magic is the greatest PG of all time. Being the best player on a top 3 best team of all time (Showtime Lakers) also is a factor  Edit: Not to mention his basketball IQ, toughness, and leadership. I hate it when people just frivolously throw around ""2nd only to Jordan"". Bullshit. Your resume has to compete with all time greats. I don't think it's an insult to call LeBron James number six greatest basketball player of all time. But you can't be number one with a 3-6 record in the finals."
"The ""best player in the league title"" is fluid and constantly switches from Steph Curry, LeBron James and Kevin Durant. If I had to rank them it would be   1. LeBron James  1a. Kevin Durant  1b. Steph Curry  Steph Curry does things that make him the best player in the game no matter who's on the floor. His weakness is his physicality and the unusual amount of fouls that aren't called for him. Steph Curry is the most cerebral of the three, but he can be made uncomfortable by teams with physical defense. Also, Steph Curry needs to add the mid range to his game, for those nights he goes 0/10 from three. If he's cold, he needs to see that ball go in but refuses to take 2 pointers. It's frustrating  Kevin Durant is a transcendant scoring talent who sees the game on a higher level ever since he joined the Warriors. His weakness is that he's not as mentally strong as LeBron or Steph and is prone to breakdowns (Steph is the leader of the Warriors, even though KD is the most talented). I don't knock him for not being an alpha like Stephen A. Smith. Some people aren't born to lead, and that's okay  LeBron James brings more to the game than anybody else. LeBron has a lot of weaknesses, the first being his mental strength (which he has improved on the last few years) and the second is LeBron James isn't willing to play off the ball. This is why high IQ teams beat him in the finals (Mavericks, Spurs, Warriors). LeBron also isn't a good leader, but better than KD  &amp;#x200B;  Every time I get close to saying these things about any of these players I get murdered by there respective fan bases. It gets exhausting but its what I believe"
"I have  1.) Jordan  Kareem  Bill Russel  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird  LeBron James  Tim Duncan  Wil Chamberlain  Shaq  Hakeem  Isiah Thomas  Kobe Bryant  Jerry West  Moses Malone  Dr. J  &amp;#x200B;  As my top 15. If LeBron gets another ring, then he moves to number 5. But there are too many blemishes on LeBron's resume to put him as #1 or #2  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Holy shit it's my list with my own opinion. My bad I don't agree with the cult of LeBron James. Eventually you guys will see that the only reason people rank him so high is the Media. Watch, in 10 years they will be asking questions like , ""Is Ben Simmons better than LeBron James?"" or ""Where does Giannis rank on the all time list?"". Do your own research, use your own brain, don't just agree with the marketing."

Breaking News:  LeBron James indicted on insider trading charges with Mychal Kendricks. Cleveland quickly becoming a hotbed of white-collar crime.
"Like all pointless top player debate, you have to consider the rules. Shaq's decline is followed by the league's zone defense becoming better implemented (although his dominance is what made it come back). But unlike say Wilt Chamberlain, Shaq didn't face zone defense (without 3 second rule) for the entirety of his career. Shaq also got to abuse his physicality in ways that the 60s rules would have declared strictly as offensive fouls. A lot of other players do that too of course, like Karl Malone or LeBron James.   Then you have to consider the modern NBA. Centers barely exist in today's leagues because they can't guard the perimeter. The 3-pt shot also changed what true offensive impact means. Because Shaq's FT% was so bad, his overall TS% is actually mediocre compared to KD, LeBron, Steph Curry, James Harden, etc.   So cherry picking the top 5 will come down to which era and rules you favor. Certainly he was the best player of the early 2000s but all the rules favored him until zone defense prevented the dominance of post playing. "

"NBA News: Anthony Davis Signs With Klutch Sports Group, Now Sharing Super Agent Rich Paul With Lakers Star LeBron James #NBANews #AnthonyDavis #KlutchSportsGroup  &amp;#x200B;"
"So what about reigning MVP, top 5 player James Harden? Why didn't he just force a move to LA or another bigger market when he was up for extension a few years ago? Could've met up with CP3 there when he was younger and when the Warriors were weaker in roster strength too. Remember when Harden signed his extension in 2016, he was coming off a first round loss to GS without Curry, after barely making the playoffs as the 8th seed, and after being snubbed from an all-nba selection on top of all that due to bad perception in his current market of all things. Way worse situation than AD is in now, coming off a sweep of the 3rd seed in the West and taking a game off the Warriors while missing his team's 2nd best player. Harden also then and now had a bigger social media following and more shoe/endorsement/marketing deals then AD, he would've been in prime position to recoup any losses from turning down the extension by moving to a big market. But he still signed the extension without a second thought basically.   I'd say Giannis, who's never made it out the first round in the EAST is the player most likely to turn down the super extension of anyone, and I still don't think that's very likely at all either unless the Bucks somehow still can't get to the 2nd round with LeBron out of their conference. "
"Lakers sign KD with their max slot in Summer 19. Then sign Ingram to a decent sized extension. Then before 2020 trade deadline when Davis is preparing to be a free agent, package Ingram for AD. New Orleans bites because they don’t want to lose AD for nothing, and Ingram will have established himself as a legitimate asset by then playing alongside Lebron.  Lonzo Ball, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Kyle Kuzma, Anthony Davis. Positionless basketball. All feasible within the salary cap."

LeBron James wins Finals MVP and now has a 3-3 record in the NBA Finals. Is he the Greatest NBA Player of All-Time? In 2016, the Thunder face the Warriors again, but this time in the Western Conference Finals. This is the Thunder's 7th consecutive playoff appearance.

"That's a very fair point that a lot have made. In fact not only do some people don't think there shouldn't be a such specific criteria for making more money (I mean AD deserved in 2015 to be the highest paid player in the league), and that it shouldn't be in the hands of the media. Some other people like [Lebron  back when Steph signed his mega deal in 2017,](https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/881228913350815744)also don't think there should be a cap at all.  Recently this past year both Lebron and Cristiano Ronaldo were free agents, both 33 years old and at the top of their game, it's an interesting comparison to see what Lebron might get on a truly open market. Soccer has no cap and basketball does so CR7 will be paid roughly 100m more than Lebron over the next 4 years.

"With KD winning the last two championships, no way LeBron James takes the max to play for the Lakers when teams like GSW can offer him more rings. "
Isn't that LeBron James Jr's draft?
That Heat team had so many good shooters. You could literally field a good 3 point competition with them alone.  \-Ray Allen  \-Mike Miller  \-James Jones  \-Shane Battier  \-Rashard Lewis  Hell even Lebron shot 40% from 3.
How does he talk like he’s a big shot? Did you just compare LeBron fucking James to Isaiah Thomas? Lebron isn’t some cocky player in over his head. HE IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD. As for hate? Are you fucking kidding? He literally gets hate for doing anything at all. 
"&gt; It also annoys me that you think people assuming/thinking LeBron James being better than Simmons (who had a year of prep) is far fetched or something lol  When did I say that? I said that people assume LeBron is better simply because he is LeBron and this sub thinks he's a literal god or something stupid and that he must have been better than everybody else at every single stage of his basketball career. That's the prevailing mindset here.       *No player could have had an equally impressive rookie season as LeBron, no way can that be true so I must downvote this craziness!!* - r/nba"
"yeah after year after year the statistical evidence showed that Kobe Bryant was one of the least clutch stars in the NBA.   He took a ton of shots in clutch situations and his hit ratio was exceptionally poor.  Of course, he inevitably hit a couple so he had this illusion of being a clutch player when he really wasn't.  The stats end up showing several players, including Carmelo Anthony, performed far better in clutch scenarios.  Plenty has been written about how terrible Kobe was in clutch situations.  Every attempt to look at the stats just come up showing he was average at best.  &gt; While Kobe has made a ton of clutch shots over his career, he has missed significantly more. Between 2000 and 2012, Kobe shot by far the highest number of attempts (230) in the final minute of games with a margin of five points or fewer for regular season games. Of those 230 attempts, he only made 80 of them. 80/230 puts him at a mediocre 34.8%, only slightly above the atrocious league average of 33.7%. This means that for every clutch basket that Kobe makes, he has 1.87 clutch misses. If those numbers are considered worthy of being considered one of the clutchest players of all time, Amar'e Stoudemire should be up there, as well.  &gt; Regular season games are great and all, but the playoffs are the games that really matter. If you think Kobe's clutch numbers are better there, boy are you wrong. In the final minute of playoff games where the margin is within five points, Kobe has gone 10/31. That's 32.3%, which means that for every one amazing make Kobe has he has 2.09 bricks.   From 2012-2015:   &gt; ""Kobe Bryant has not made a single clutch shot in the final five seconds of a game in almost three years. Thirteen straight misses, which if you like sound effects goes something like BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG. BONG.""

NBA Rumors: LeBron James 'nudged' the Raptors into 'Downward-Dog Position'
"If this is what lights a fire under Wiggins, I'd be disappointed. Wiggins was hyped in high school like no other basketball player except LeBron James and has yet to show anything for it. They brought in a tough, hard-work, defensive mindset veteran to teach him and that still somehow failed. Maybe KAT will use this as motivation, but Wiggins has failed to show much motivation throughout the past 4 years."
"Lol says the guy whose team had Lebron Fuckin James.    Seriously though, we are fortunate to see such incredible talents in our lifetimes. "
Wait till OPs next post about lebron james being underrated in the current generation 
It’s not assumed the Spurs will make all of their free throws. You can quickly advance the ball full court with a well placed outlet pass that positions the receiver within the half court. Love and LeBron have done this before. Rondo and Ball are fully capable of doing this. Eight seconds is plenty of time for a LeBron James led team to score from full court.
Not many folks in the nba world are gonna turn down magic Johnson and lebron James asking for the same thing so Lol all you want lmao
"Have you never watched Lebron James play basketball?  Look at the 2010 Cavs too, when Lebron left for the Heat. They went from I think the conference semis the year before to like 20 wins with a 20 game losing streak."
Kemba Walker  Giannis  Lebron James  John Wall  Dirk        
"Aren't these the head coaches that constantly underrate coaches like Brad Stevens? Well Lebron James is gone and Lue is getting blown out by the Brooklyn Nets and the fucking Atlanta Hawks, if they were 6-0 we would be talking all about how Lebron held back Lue and how he hasn't gotten any credit.   Thanks for the information though, i didn't realize coaches held Lue in such high value but there's a reason front offices don't "
Most incompetent franchise in sports history. Their relevance rises and falls with LeBron James.
Disappointed in the Cavs decision to let go of Lue. I think it will be clear after this MISERABLE season The LLLLakers are going to have that LUE was the reason the Cavs won the 2016 finals. Lebron James very overrated! 
I think Skip just called him George Paul then realized he slipped up. His names James Lebron cause he’s not alpha! Doesn’t make much sense lmao.
"Along with Damon Jones and James Posey, Tyronn Lue would never have been in the Cavs coaching staff, much less become the head coach had it not been for LeBron. All 3 of them were no more than LeBron's lackeys.   The aforementioned 3, among with Tristan Thompson and JR Smith should thank their lucky stars everyday that LeBron got them paid. The leverage he had over the team was something else. "
"George Hill is not a solid player anymore. I've loved the dude since he came into the league with the Spurs, enjoyed watching him in Indiana and Utah, and was thrilled when the Cavs got him last year. But he doesn't have it anymore. His defense ain't great these days, and he can't score or move with quickness. He's cooked.  This roster is not good. They're solid role players who can succeed in the right situation, but the right situation is not ""Roster Established and Built Around Lebron James And/Or Another Superstar Who Excels with the Ball in His Hands At All Times."" They have nobody outside of Love who can capably create their own shot. They don't have anyone who is a great passer (even positionally) outside of Love. And he's a power forward who is slow. They lack a genuine leader and someone who can will them to where they need to be. So they might be solid players, but they sure as hell are not in this dysfunctional, broken roster.  Sexton ought to be playing more - with the starters, especially - so they can see what they have in him. They need to be playing him big minutes with Cedi and Nance, two guys who figure to solid hands on the team for years to come."

"As a cavaliers fan I’ve seen this before, you guys just need more LeBron James to win. If he thought his job was going to get easier he should’ve gone to the spurs."
Fun fact: Russell Westbrook won the same # of games against Lebron James in the 2018 playoffs as the Toronto Raptors
These days even LeBron James has to work 2 jobs to make ends meet. 
"What I don't get about these early season firings is why they don't happen over the summer. A firing six games in means you were prepared to fire this dude already. Why not get it over with and find your next coach. Larry Drew ain't your next coach. I don't know what the expectations were for this team internally.   What if, maybe, the defense wasn't actually all LeBron's fault. There was a lot of internet chatter about Cleveland trying harder on defense once James left because the players would actually try and not follow his lazy example. But what if these dudes just aren't good. What if Kevin Love wasn't underutilized because LeBron is a jerk and Lue is stupid, but because his skills have lapsed since he was in Minnesota?  I just don't understand how Gilbert makes decisions. Has any team really truly excelled when firing a coach this early in the season? Lue may be bad, but without a real plan in place for what you want the team to be why pay more money to get equally bad results?"
https://www.google.com/amp/s/fansided.com/2014/04/03/pat-riley-recruited-lebron-james-dumping-bag-championship-rings-table/amp/  Article is trash but the info is there. He literally just dumped a bag of rings on the table when he met both Bron and Bosh. Supposedly Bosh still had one of his rings until a few years ago. 
"&gt;According to Chris Haynes of cleveland.com, Blatt tried too hard ""to get in the good graces of his top talent."" He held back from criticizing members of his Big Three — James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving — and whistled players for ticky-tack fouls on his stars during practice.   &gt;Blatt alienated players trying to kiss up to LeBron and never won over his biggest star, who was dissatisfied with many of Blatt’s coaching moves and his European pedigree. In the end, though, it appears it wasn’t Blatt’s failure to win over LeBron as much as it was his failure to win the locker room. That created a disconnect between the players and coach, which GM David Griffin referred to at his news conference, and led to a ""lack of spirit"" that manifested not only in embarrassing losses to San Antonio and Golden State, but also after wins.  &gt;""Sometimes you can win games in this league in the regular season and get worse,"" Griffin said. ""I think we were regressing over a period of time.""  &gt;Assistant coach Tyronn Lue won over the players, Haynes writes, because he’s not afraid to criticize the stars and hold them accountable. Now Lue takes over the head-coaching job he was considered for before Blatt was hired. ""He has the pulse of our team,"" Griffin said of Lue.   It's not just about who the better coach is. It's about who the better fit is. Lue was the better fit in that locker room. Also, this cites that it wasn't just LeBron's decision. I'm sure he played a huge role in it but it was the general locker room feeling that led to Blatt's firing.  But many of us will just LeMeme."
"Ehhhh kinda, he did have love, kyrie and Lebron fucking James to help tho."
"Dan Gilbert yelled, “There you go!” Kevin Love gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We don't got a fucking coach now.” And before Ty Lue hit the locker room door, ex-Cavs star LeBron James hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"But LeBron didn't ask for people who could shoot/score and nothing else, if anything it's the opposite because I remember people on here making fun of him for wanting extra playmakers on the roster in 2017.   That's when the Cavs went half a year without another ball handler behind James and Irving because they wanted one for free (Deron Williams) during buyouts.  As if that wasn't smart enough last year Cleveland traded away Kyrie for nothing (again, in terms having players who could run the offense that year), and at the deadline they got two more inefficient scorers in Hood and Clarkson.  Just because LeBron's biggest talent is collapsing the defense and dishing it to the open man it doesn't mean everything else doesn't matter when building a roster, it's a terrible way of putting a team together and it showed.

"Actually I think the initial hiring of lue as associate HC and eventual promotion was all about Lebron  &gt;Lue played 11 years in the NBA, won two titles with the Los Angeles Lakers and has spent the past five seasons learning under highly respected coach Doc Rivers with Boston and the L.A. Clippers.  &gt;Yet there is an under-reported key to this transaction.  &gt;Lue is very good friends with LeBron James. And it’s no secret that the Cavs are dying to re-recruit the Miami Heat star back to Cleveland someday, which Lue could help facilitate.  &gt;Clearly, he can’t go into direct talks with James about changing teams. Tampering rules exist. But seeing Lue installed as the Cavs’ No. 2 man is sure to catch James’ attention.  &gt;How close are Lue and James?  &gt;In June 2007, Nebraska organized a basketball fund-raising golf tournament and invited prominent alumni to return. Those on the organizing committee targeted Lue — then playing with the Atlanta Hawks — but worried about fitting into his schedule.  &gt;Enter James.  &gt;He arranged private aircraft for Lue to fly to game three of the NBA Finals to watch James and the Cavaliers face San Antonio; then another jet to Lincoln for Lue to play in the Husker golf event; then another jet back to Cleveland for game four.  https://www.omaha.com/huskers/barfknecht-cavaliers-addition-of-lue-may-catch-lebron-s-eye/article_05b05434-e8cf-540d-8abc-697dc0dc1c0a.html "
"LeBron James is amazing, don’t get me wrong, but Michael Jordan has THE greatest BBQIQ of all time. No question about it."
"As a more casual NBA viewer who only watches games here and there:  + Is it just me, or was Lebron on the bench for longer than he should have been down the stretch? Considering how rookie a lot of the other players are, I would think they'd have him manage more of the close.  + Unless I'm just underestimating the Spurs, this game should be sending up alarm bells for the Lakers staff. If the Lakers are actual playoff contenders, I was expecting a comfortable win on Lebron James' back alone.  + There's such an overwhelming disparity between Lebron and the next best player in the Lakers lineup that their coaching staff has no idea what to do with him. He can basically score at will on his own, especially against less superstar teams such as the Spurs, but the rest of the squad is so inexperienced that the path to integrate him into any cohesive strategy will be a long and painful one."
odds that tristan Thompson has finally realized LeBron james is no longer on the squad?
"The sole reason why the Cleveland Cavaliers are tanking right now is to make LeBron James look like the best player of all time. Not because they aren't good enough to win games, not because they would maybe get a good lottery pick. No. Fuck that. They just want to make LeBron look good. Man you are a fucking genius. Props for figuring that out."
"Cavs are going to win 3 out of the next 4 lottery picks, culminating in them drafting LeBron James Jr. The NBA script got leaked"
"sick man 2016 lebron james vs a post from 2013 of kobe doing it several times, with some when he still had the number 8 jersey."
idk if i’d say that....it is LEBRON JAMES after all 
"It’s just one facet of their game. And again I said greatest slasher as well, that’s what led him to a FMVP and also he was very arguably the best player on a team with LeBron James on it in 2011.   DWades 2006 ring holds more water than any of Curry’s super team championships IMO.   When you factor in defense as well, Dwade looks pretty good. "
"&gt; Timing matters. Wade was unlucky to peak at the same time that LeBron began to peak and Kobe was at his. Of course he wasnt going to win an MVP.  To be fair, Harden won an MVP award during the ""peak"" of Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James.  This doesn't mean I think that Harden is better than Wade, just that saying Wade was ""unlucky"" because he peaked alongside some fantastic players doesn't seem all that compelling because Harden is in the same boat with different stars, he actually won the award instead though."
Which of these players is he better than  Michael Jordan  LeBron James  Bill Russell  Kareem-Abdul Jabbar  Wilt Chamberlain  Magic Johnson  Tim Duncan  Larry Bird  Shaquille O'Neal  Hakeem Olajuwon  Kobe Bryant  At the absolute bare minimum he needs to be better than 2 of them to make the top 10. 
Greatness recognizes greatness. No mention of Lebron I’m not suprised.   Frankly LeBron James is a Tier 2 player at this point in his career.
Lot of stupid plays by everyone not named lebron James in that 4th quarter 
"Lebron James will be almost 37 when Lillard can sign there, but ok."
LLLLakers playing really BAD! Get the LeBron James guy off the court! 
"And if we didn't give CP3 the contract and he walked... do we just waste a year of Harden's prime anyway to hopefully rebuild/sign a 2019 star while teams like LA, NY, etc. will be doing the same thing? Of course any fan would like their star player to take the vet min to help the team win, but by the time that fiasco would have been resolved every free agent would have been gone anyways.  Also the Capela point is completely inaccurate because he was a RFA. We had no reason to raise his value since we're tight on cap regardless(if  we had given him the max he wanted that would also make it hard to sign a complementary star) so we waited to match which no one did...  Also most stars take the max, even the beloved Lebron James. If he took the minimum,I'm sure they could work something out. Could the same argument be made about him? Did CP3 publicly ask for his teammates to take discounts? Maybe he could have taken a little less, but it's absurd to ask him to take pennies and he's really only doing it for ""flexiblity in the future"" where he himself is in ""win-now mode""."

"It was only a matter time before the Lakers were going to do this, this is the best decision for Lonzo and the team. Lonzo will have time to develop as a starting point guard and having LeBron James as your teammate helps a lot."
"Fuck the pistons.  May they rot in hell.  Lately in the East, a main rival has always been whatever team Lebron James was on.  Knicks/Bulls in the 90s  Pistons in the 2000s  Heat/Cavaliers in the 2010s"
"That MJ had more help than Lebron. His argument is the Bulls still made It deep in the playoffs when Jordan was not there. And the Cavs became trash after James left, and the heat were pretty dead too. "
"Curry peaked higher than KD but KD has been a top 2 player in the world for like 7 fucking years. If Lebron James didn't exist we'd be talking about KD as a top 10 player ever and he'd have 3 or 4 MVPs of his own. KD now and all time is both better than Steph   &gt; Durant never got passed prime Curry, so just stop it.   KD almost entirely missed the season Curry won his first MVP, and when Curry was at his peak in his unanimous MVP season KD had a 3-1 lead over him until it all went to shit.   Saying ""Durant never got passed prime Curry"" when he faced prime Curry ONCE in a playoff series that went 7 games is supremely dumb "

That's the main thing: the media loves LeBron so anyone who gives him a black eye (like Kyrie demanding a trade and, in their minds, sinking LeBron's chances at winning another title in Cleveland) is going to be the target of some underlying resentment.  The flat-earth shit didn't help either, but athletes have said and done worse and still been embraced by the media. Just look at Tyreke Hill or Joe Mixon in the NFL."
"I don’t get why these are still convos to have. KD and Steph are superstars, Steph had a bad game in the game 3 of the finals and Durant picked up the slack and helped win that game. Especially with the other two all stars they already have. They swept Lebron James after he had a historical game 1. They can do whatever the fuck they want, the last two finals I think cemented the statement. "

Kawhi is the most dangerous player in the league for real. Pop does not want him in the same conference. He was gonna be sent east for pennies anyways. Lebron is great and all but has nothing to prove anymore. He has already proven and was considered the best player in the league for too long. That's why he doesn't play defense anymore. Pop wouldn't trade kawhi even for lebron james himself. The only way he would have traded kawhi to the east would be for kevin durant.
Javale just needed a better coach to fully take advantage of his potential  LeBron James for 2019 Coach of the Year
Oh the one that just tore the ACL?   Hmm. Let me see:  Very good front office  Lebron James  Very good young core   Good set of bench players     Or    Porzingis? 
"Yeah, most top players were just like this at Towns' age. Lebron was doing his childish celebratory dances on the sideline and referring to himself in the 3rd person in interviews -- he came off as smug and immature. Durant played minimal defense for the first 5 or so years of his career. Anthony Davis, who we all knew had DPOY potential, chased blocks and was constantly out of position defensively for the first 3 or 4 years of his career. It was really only last year that he emerged as a dominating defensive player. Hell, James Harden just won the MVP and still plays no defense.  You need to treat these players like hte kids that they are. The trashy ""scream at them"" and tell them they are lazy approach to parenting generally doesn't have a good outcome. You have to connect with them and support them. Put them in a position to succeed and show a willingness to be patient as long as they are making an effort to improve themselves."
"He got literally everything he wanted for Lonzo. What’s left to say?   Even all the trade rumors / players that Lakers are targeting aren’t PGs except mayyybe Dame Lillard but even Dame would play fine with Lonzo in the back court.  If the Lakers were trying for Conley as a way to cash in early on Bron... mayyyybe LaVar would pipe up.   But Butler, Klay, Kawhi those guys all play on the wing where Ingram and Kuzma have the most minutes.  Ball looks like he’ll play at least his early prime with LeBron James.   Magic and LeBron are like the household heroes for the Ball family.   The only thing that LaVar didn’t get was Gelo on the Lakers and tbh, he knew it was a long shot. He wasn’t wrong he went pro. Lmao dude just had to create his own league to make it happen.   I know he’s had shitty moments but that is a dad going the extra fuckin mile. "

"Their offense is so much more fluid right now. Plus Giannis is not forcing it and can just be an all-around beast.   The only thing hurting his game early in the season is the three-point shooting. He has to slow down a bit cause he has been terrible from distance.   He really doesn't need a three to be the best. He just needs to be able to hit it when he has time and space. Doesn't have to force the issue.   He is not a wing player. The dude has the size, length and play-style of a power-forward. And in this modern era, he can def play as a 5 from time to time.   A legit 4 with the handles, passing and athleticism he possesses just makes him a terror and makes his potential more scary than if he tries to play like a Ben Simmons or Lebron James. "

Players averaging 22/5.8/3.8 or higher are: this list plus Damian Lillard, and minus Vucevic and Embiid "
"Watch your tongue! You're speaking to LeBron James, the true High King"
"Same as a bunch of people have said, that there's an asterisk next to his rings:  &gt;""Durant, I mean, as great a player as he is, I would still hold back because, man, he joined a team that really didn't need him. You know what I mean?"" said Frazier, a television analyst for Knicks games on MSG Network. ""He's right there with LeBron [James], probably will surpass LeBron as the best player in the game soon. But for him doing that, I still don't give him the full credit that he probably would have deserved if he stayed with [the Oklahoma City Thunder] and won a title with that team.   He's going to be down the list for me because of that. There will be an asterisk by his name"""
"How much did the Cavs pay the past 3 years? I mean, it just depends on what you're making on TV deals, merchandising, sponsorship deals, etc. 2 billion is a shit ton of money, true.. but if you had the ability to ask Jeanie Buss or James Dolan if they would pay that for a championship contender for the next 4 years + sold out seats and crazy ticket prices.. I guarantee they both are gonna think about that long and hard. My money is on Jeanie saying yes to that too.  They've got Lebron for this season plus 3 more. Plus if you get Kawhi next year.. yeah. Laker ticket prices are already absurd. Imagine next year with this team + Kawhi.. nosebleeds are gonna start at 300.  Just doing some math on that.. I don't know what the real seating number is for Staples, but lets say 18000 seats on an average of 400 per seat. Over an 82 game season, that's 600 million PER SEASON, not including playoffs. So yeah.. I don't think it's that crazy. Just depends, are you gonna be a contender? Cause you get to raise prices.. and up there in San Francisco, they're gonna sell those games out, every night. I understand not all of that goes to the team, but yeah.. that's definitely a realistic consideration imo"
Breaking: LeBron James suffers career ending back injury after falling down the stairs in his home.
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/top-100-nba-players-for-2018-19-lebron-james-headlines-rankings-front-loaded-with-west-superstars/  i wouldn't put him top 100 in the league but this list kinda helps 
"He’s 21 years old man. He has an enormous ceiling.  If the Lakers weren’t willing to offer Ingram for Kawhi, than they clearly see something in him. LeBron James has spoken highly of him as well. Are you claiming to know more then them? "
"&gt; But defensively LeBron is just about the worst player in the league to be playing PF next to him   You sound like one of those dumb kids who has been trying super hard to believe that LeBron is declining for the past few years, but everytime y'all bums get slapped in the face when playoffs arrive.   &gt;   The exaggeration of LeBron's defense has been getting way out of hand. There's a HUGE difference in being a bad defender, and just not wasting energy on defense intentionally. This is LeBron fucking James fool. Dude's super big, super strong, super fast and with unreal IQ.. So he can always be a defensive powerhouse still, but only for a short burst of time when he wants to..   &gt;  He's 34 and in his 16th season. Defense is not his priority right now like it was when he was young. He's not playing in a stacked GSW team, who has countless super elite offensive players and shooters. If that was the case, then LeBron would have focused more on defense than on offense. But he couldn't do that with the Cavs, and he can't do that with the Lakers   &gt;   LeBron has to dictate the whole offense, that's why his team picks other teams apart.. Him running the point is always super deadly. So on the defensive end, he just can't give that much effort anymore. And the man always coasts in the regular season anyways. Playoff LeBron is a whole different type of beast. I think you should know that by now fool. So just stop hating, it ain't even that deep. Chill out"

Lebron  James
I know you're really jealous he didn't join Philly but you have to do some pretty strong mental gymnastics to think Lebron James has a loser mentality. He's the only reason Cleveland made the finals you moron. They're 0-5 right now and the only player missing is Lebron. What a joke. So because he joins a young team with cap space and potential he has a loser mentality? Delete this absolute bullcrap  So he wouldn't have a loser's mentality if he stayed in Cleveland to get swept for the rest of his career? Or are you one of those idiots that actually thinks LA doesn't have a bright future? 
"It's amazing to me that people even talk about free agency as a solution to *any* team's serious problems.   Shaq's Orlando rookie contract expired before restricted free agency existed, so Orlando had no opportunity to match the contract Shaq signed with LA. This was also before max contracts existed. The cap in summer 1996 was $24.3m. If the max salary rules existed as they are today, that would have qualified Shaq for a max starting at $6.1m/year. His contract with the Lakers started at $10.7m. No way Orlando lets him go if they have the right to match and the most a team could offer was a deal starting at $6.1m.  As far as other stars who have switched teams as FAs goes, I'm pretty sure this is the full list of true all-star caliber players post-1999 CBA who switched teams as free agents or in sign and trades where the receiving team gave up negligible assets relative to the player's value:  1. Lebron -&gt; Miami (2010) -&gt; Cleveland (2014) -&gt; Lakers (2018) 2. Durant -&gt; Warriors (2016) 3. Chris Bosh -&gt; Miami  (2010) 4. Dwight Howard -&gt; Houston (2013) 5. Lamarcus Aldridge -&gt; San Antonio (2015) 6. Chris Paul -&gt; Houston (2017)  Other players you might think of such as Joe Johnson going to Atlanta, T-Mac going to Orlando and Harden going to Houston... none of these guys were All-Stars until after they were traded. Same goes to a lesser extent with Steve Nash going to Phoenix. He was a fringe All-Star type before going to Phoenix (2x All-Star pre-trade in 6 total seasons).  Then you have players like Iguodala, Paul Millsap, David Lee, Carlos Boozer, Al Horford and Gordon Hayward... very good players who had made 1+ ASGs before signing as free agents but not guys who you jump for joy about paying huge money to. Similarly, players like Baron Davis and Elton Brand were later into their careers and had injury concerns that brought down their value.  And as far as the list goes, I'd break it into three categories:  1. Lebron is his own brand and makes a ton of money outside of his NBA salary, which put him in a distinct category. Bosh likely looked to leverage Lebron's brand when he chose Miami. 2. Durant was only able to leave and go to a better team without sacrificing serious money because of the 1-off huge cap jump. 3. Dwight, Aldridge and Paul were all later into their careers and had already made enormous amounts of money. Dwight's age showed almost immediately, making his contract only okay. Aldridge and Paul have had anomalously long primes.   A second observation: all the players on the list went to great teams or in the case of Dwight, a team that seemed on the brink of greatness due to youth and cap flexibility. So if a team wins like 45 games or fewer, the odds that a superstar joins you who isn't Lebron James seem basically nil."

More alpha than alpha: using LeBron James as your back protecting cushion thing.
"LOL anybody who ignores what other Coaches say about Ty Lue are idiots. LeBron James is the greatest player in the World, but he can't win a championship without a coach. If you ignore what Ty Lue did in 2016, you're a fool.  Coaching is not easy, it's actually a job even harder than the one LeBron James excels at. You get none of the credit when things go well, and you get all of the blame when things fall short. And I think something people realized but didn't admit was the fact the Cavs may have a fundamentally broken team. They're full of young talent but they don't have any bit of a cohesive unit. People complain about the defenders, but outside of David Nwaba they really have no one.  I may be biased, but if you think Ty Lue is a bad coach, you don't understand the situation the Cavs are in (and have been since Kyrie left). The roster is broken. NOT TO SAY LUE IS A GREAT COACH! I like him, but ya there are better coaches out there. But, please, internet dweebs, don't act like you know more than a coach who won an NBA championship. Chill.  If you want to debate me on specifics, I'd be happy to do so. This notion of ""No halftime adjustments"" and whatnot is just not true. A lot of decisions he's made were actually the best case scenario given the circumstances in game and their roster.  "
"The Warriors have been for, what, like four years? Lakers have been getting their hands on top players pretty much ever since there's been an NBA. Just looking at all-time greats, we've had Miken, Baylor, West, Wilt, Kareem, Magic, Shaq, Kobe and Lebron. That's not even getting into regular superstars like James Worthy and Pau Gasol. Some of those guys the Lakers drafted, but they all wanted to be in LA, but the ones we drafted chose to spend their entire careers in LA. Obviously the ones that came through trades or FA also wanted to be here. "

breaking news lebron james is a highly streaky shooter
"The Los Angeles Lakers are off to a slow start this season (1-3) and it will take time for the team to develop their offensive identities. Slow starts are not uncommon in LeBron James’ first year with a new team, as we saw with his first year with the Miami Heat and in his second stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  Yet both those teams followed a similar blueprint for success.  The Heat featured two running mates for James, and, most importantly, an array of shooters that will help spread the floor. In his four years with Miami the Heat never finished lower than 12th in three-point percentage and rose as high as second, leading to a Finals appearance every year for four years and two championships.  [Here’s what’s behind the NBA’s scoring explosion]  The Cavs followed the same plan when James returned home. They already had Kyrie Irving, traded for Kevin Love and continued to add shooters during his four-year run. Again reaching the finals in all four seasons and winning one. In addition, the Cavs never finished below 7th in three-point percentage.  Lakers President of Basketball Operations Magic Johnson and General Manager Rob Pelinka have decided to a go a different route. After signing James, they signed Rajon Rondo, a career 31 percent shooter from three-point range, Lance Stephenson, a career 30 percent shooter from deep, and Michael Beasley, a reserve who averages four minutes a game and connects at a 35 percent rate from behind the arc. The result: the Lakers rank 29th in three-point percentage after four games showing spreading out around the arc will not work for this team, even with a gifted passer like James dishing the ball.  In Cleveland’s first four games last season, James has created 45 threes and his teammates made 17 of them (38 percent). After the first four games with his new team, James created 37 three-point attempts and they have only made 12 (28 percent).    FGA for the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2018-19 Regular Season In addition to scrapping a proven blueprint, the Lakers are asking James to play at light speed, a pace that has never suited him. The Lakers are second in pace (107.3 possessions per game) after finishing third last season. Last season was the fastest James has ever played at 99.7, years before that he was at 97.7, 95.0, and 94.6.  The NBA has been trending toward a faster pace over the past few years and the Lakers are following that trend. The issue though is, in James’ 16th season at the ripe age of 34; can he keep up this up and remain effective? For this team, he will have to carry a large load to keep the Lakers competitive in the West because management could not attract a second star to join him this summer.  After four games, James leads all players 33 years old or older in usage rate and is behind LaMarcus Aldridge in minutes per game. Chris Paul leads this group in pace but is averaging seven fewer minutes than LeBron. Currently no one in this group is carrying the load that James is for his team.  We’ve seen this before. In 1996-97, at age 33, Michael Jordan averaged 38 minutes and a usage rate of 33 percent and did it again the following year. The big difference is Jordan’s pace (90.0) wasn’t close to the pace that James is playing at now. In fact, there hasn’t been an NBA player that has been James’ age, playing at this pace, usage and amount of minutes to even compare this to. He is actually walking through uncharted waters.  James has been one of the most durable players in the league, never missing more than 12 games in a season. The amount of care that he puts into his body is legendary. However, at some point all the minutes James has played over his career will eventually catch up to him. To hold off Father Time, the Lakers should use James’s gravitational pull and the cutting game to create opportunities for everyone else.  According to Synergy Sports, the Lakers are averaging 1.7 points per possession off cuts to the basket, second-highest in the NBA this year, but only run that play six percent of the time, seventh-fewest. Head coach Luke Walton has to run more actions that will allow them to take advantage of James’s gravity and create easy baskets.  The Lakers lack shooters but have several players that can be great cutters from Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a highflying center in JaVale McGee. Besides James, Los Angeles has Lonzo Ball and Rondo who are great passers in their own right who can also find these cutters. Cutting will open up other opportunities for the Lakers if defense take away the initial cuts. Increasing the frequency of cutting will make the Lakers a more dynamic offensive team and would be the best use of the players currently on their roster.  The young Lakers have to be more aware of those cutting opportunities, too. Here is a missed one from their game against the Spurs. As soon as James gets the ball, Bryn Forbes slides away from Ball to the nail (middle of the free throw line) to discourage any drive to the hoop. This is a great opportunity for Ball to cut right behind Forbes but he doesn’t and the Spurs force a turnover.   If the Lakers are going to make the playoffs with this roster this year it is going to require some changing of trends. James is going to have to continue to change and play at a pace above and beyond what he has ever played, the offense will need to be more focused on cutting and off ball movement. Most importantly, the Lakers are going to need to make these adjustments fast. The trend of James’s teams starting slow could prove more in the stacked West than the wide-open East, and the difference between making and missing the playoffs will probably come down to just a handful of games."

yeah thats why we all fucking hate lebron james right?
"&gt; Also, why is that as soon as 4th quarter starts we forget everything offensively and settle for LeBron James iso'ing with 5 on the clock. Is Luke really that bad not to understand that playing like that sucks and its unsustainable in the long run? How can you be so dense with understanding that?  Except it's not. Isoing one of the best iso players ever is a great fucking strategy."
"Lebron ""Literally Steph Curry"" James"
"It's so devastating to see that LeBron James is suffocating Brandon Ingram so much in his game. The moment he steps off the court the guy turns into a killer. I have no idea how they'll solve that, but this is a big problem for the Lakers as Ingram should be clear no#2 option for this team.   Meanwhile, Lonzo playing great tonight. Passed the ball, scored a bit, great defense. All around very strong performance.  Also, why is that as soon as 4th quarter starts we forget everything offensively and settle for LeBron James iso'ing with 5 on the clock. Is Luke really that bad not to understand that playing like that sucks and its unsustainable in the long run? How can you be so dense with understanding that?   Besides this, good win. We hustled back. These type of games are the ones that team should not be losing if we're after a good playoff spot."
Nice to have the LeFuckYou3 on our end. Wow LeBron James is a Laker. I think it's finally sitting in.

All you Lonzo haters should know that he leads the league in screens set for LeBron James
LeBron James 
"[Wojnarowski] LeBron James waited outside Mavs locker room after the game, says getting a signed Doncic jersey was 'depressing'."
Then I’m OK missing out on a couple of these young assets in exchange for Lebron James.

Simple  1. Outperform LeBron James in the playoffs 
Michael Jordan  Dwyane Wade  Larry Bird  LeBron James  Kobe Bryant  Magic Johnson  Hakeem Olajuwon  Alex English  Carmelo Anthony  Bill Laimbeer  Muggsy Bogues  Isiah Thomas  Isaiah Thomas  Allen Iverson  Giannis  Russell Westbrook  Dominique Wilkins  Shawn Kemp  Gary Payton  Kawhi Leonard  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Elvin Hayes  Wes Unseld  James Harden  John Stockton  Karl Malone  Scottie Pippen  And MANY MANY MAAANY MORE...  Let’s hope I live to 69! So I can brag about being able to see the next generational talent.
"Drafting talent over fit has become such dogma on this sub that no one considers there might be some room for nuance. Yes of course if the talent is LeBron James, you draft that guy. But rarely is the talent discussed a once-in-a-generation player. And if he is not, it's foolish and reckless to not consider how he'll fit (and what opportunities he'll have to develop) on your team.  Consider the Orlando Magic. In 2013 they trade for Tobias Harris and draft Oladipo. In 2014 they draft Aaron Gordon and (essentially cuz he was a draft-day trade) Elfrid Payton. All talented players. But none of them could consistently shoot, so offensively they were terrible leading the team to trade Harris, Oladipo, and Payton for peanuts. Now that those young players fit on their teams 1 has become an All-Star, 1 will likely be an All-Star this year, and even Payton looked decent with the Pelicans before he got injured.   While talent is priority #1, you need also to consider how your team can nurture and develop that talent."
"Drake isn't a fan, Drake is the brand ambassador to the Raptors. His job is to be the face of the Raptors to the mainstream and make it so that his name is synonymous with the Raptors. If you think of Drake, the only basketball team you should be thinking of is the Raptors.  Hanging out with the Warriors dilutes his role as brand ambassador. People will associate Drake as ""the basketball guy"" instead of ""the Raptors guy"" which is what a brand ambassador should do. Players can be buddy buddy with opponents because it's not their job to represent the franchise, they just play for it. Imagine if Lebron James showed up to an Adidas event."
Those are the people that didn't want LeBron Fucking James on their team.
Born in 98 1.Lebron James 2. Kobe Bryant  3. Kevin Durant  4. Dirk Nowitzky  5. Dwayne Wade  
Ya hey hey! I was born in 1970 and was listening/watching/living and breathing basketball since I was 6-7.   1. Michael Jordan  2. LeBron James  3. Kareem Abdul Jabber  4. Hakeem Olajuwon  5. Kobe Bryant    Feel free to ask any questions!
1.LeBron James 2.Kobe Bryant 3.Kevin Durant 4.Stephen Curry 5.Tim Duncan (saw him post prime starting at 07-08ish )
Ill make this list in the eyes of myself watching basketball in the late 90s early 2000s  1. Vince Carter  2. Kobe Bryant 3. Shaq 4. LeBron 5. Allen Iverson  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  realistically for me it's probably  1. LeBron James 2. Kobe Bryant 3. Shaq 4. Tim Duncan 5. Steph Curry
"1v1 I think LeBron falls off. KD, Harden, and Kyrie all have drop off moves or super shooting.      LeBron has strength. I think there are gonna be way less times that James can defend these other players than the other way around, and his shooting doesn't make up for it.      KD is, ***in my opinion***, the most Versatile Scorer of all time, meaning a threat from literally every single position with every single play style. Kobe is the best scorer. Curry is the best shooter. Harden is not number one of these 3 categories, but he's in the top end. Kyrie was literally made to 1v1.      LeBron has dominating force. But I don't think he is 1v1 material."
"Really? Equally efficient? You want to stick to that claim? Here’s the facts Leonard 48.2 FG% Harden 43.7 FG% Does that seem “equal” to you? Similar rebounding? Kawhi per 36 min rebounds: 9.0 Harden per 36 min rebounds: 5.4 That doesn’t seem to similar to me.  Kawhi has one good play off run? How many does harden have? 0.  We can go back to the time he disappeared in game 6. Let’s go back even further. What about that time the rockets made that legendary comeback down 3-1 against the clippers. Remember that elimination game 5, when the rockets made that unbelievable comeback to avoid elimination? Surely harden had a lot to do with that, right? Of course he didn’t. Not only was he not the driving force of that comeback, he was BENCHED. Because he was playing so unbelievably poorly. Josh Smith of all people bailed them out, because Harden is too much of a choker to do it, so he had to have Josh Freaking Smith bail him out. Do you know how embarrassing that is? I could go and find defensive stats to prove my point, but do I even have too? If you want me to continue educating you I can, but I think you get the point now. If not, just ask and I’ll go get some more stats for you. James Harden is a great player. He’s an MVP. He beat out Westbrook for an MVP after Westbrook averaged a triple double last season. That’s an amazing accomplishment. Very few players win an MVP. He’s just not as good as Kawhi or people like that. That’s fine. He doesn’t have to be. He’s great in his own right. He’s just not THAT guy. He could never be the best player on a championship team. I hope he teams up with a better player one day so he can win a championship. He’s just proven time and time again he can’t handle the pressure when push comes to shove. That’s why he always performs so well in regular season. No pressure. But post season is another story. Too much pressure. What happens when Kawhi faces a top 2 player in NBA history in Lebron, who has Dwayne wade and Chris Bosh at his side. Not only does he win, he wills his team to the worst beating in finals history at the time. It was the largest point spread of any finals at the time. Why was that the case? Because Kawhi played the best defense that has ever been played on LeBron. I’ve never seen someone control Lebron like he did. It was unreal. Could you ever imagaine Harden doing that? Me either. "
"We have Lebron fucking James and you want to die? Lol calm down.  Let's say we don't sign him and let the young guys develop. There's already a slim chance they become good enough to get us to the next level. Then what? We're left close to rebuild again anyway.  We have LBJ, tradeable assets, and enough money for a max next summer. There are far worse positions to be in."

"Okay, so according to Shaq last night:  * Kawhi Leonard is the second-best player in the league * Giannis Antetokounmpo is the best player in the east * The best player in the league is either Giannis, LeBron James or Kevin Durant * He’s talking apples and you’re asking orange questions"

"&gt; Yup, he did choke that Kentucky game. Fox went off on that game and dropped 41 - that's why he always ducks him in the NBA right? But are you aware what he was going through in his personal life with his mom having a stroke around that time?    Lots of college players come from a much less privileged upbringing than Lonzo. Many of them struggle to make ends meet for their poor family and that's not something Lonzo ever had to worry about. They all deal with that financial and family stress on a nightly basis.  &gt; His defense is nothing special - do you watch the games?    Yeah I watch him get blown past by many opposing guards, since they don't have to spend much energy guarding him on the offensive end. And like I said before, his defensive rating is nothing special.   &gt; Finally, hoping for 15, 5 &amp; 5 on good effiency as a MINIMUM is not mediocre for a second year player who is NOT a scorer in a team with LEBRON JAMES and other players that need the ball to be effective because they can't impact in other ways   Yeah it is pretty mediocre for the second draft pick and he's not even managing that. And you're right, he's not a scorer, because he doesn't have the ability to score. He can't create his own shot, can't drive well, can't finish and his shooting ability is terrible.  &gt; Understandably his assist numbers would be down in team with Rondo and LeBron. Last time I checked Draymond Green was averaging 10-7-7 going to All Star games.    Draymond Green has helped his team win multiple championships and has been to the playoffs many times. Lonzo hasn't done any of that. He's also a better shooter than Lonzo, a point guard.  &gt; You can say he's been a disappointment for a 2nd overall pick (but what about the 1st - who's value is virtually non-existent right now)    Yeah and the #1 pick has been a huge disappointment so far too."

"If they can get one more big name to come to LA, then I feel they can do it. The team already got a talented roster and one of the best players in the world in LeBron James they just need one more big free agent to complete the Championship Puzzle."
"Yup, he did choke that Kentucky game. Fox went off on that game and dropped 41 - that's why he always ducks him in the NBA right? But are you aware what he was going through in his personal life with his mom having a stroke around that time?   I meant he change the culture and feeling around the place. The fans started to believe in the program again, but that seemed to be short lived as they are back to being mediocre since he left.   As I said he has a lot to work on offensively. He may never find it, I hope he does. I do see great  passing ability in transition. But he can tend to stand in the corner and do nothing in the half court. Also, with LeBron in the team he doesn't have as many opportunities to show his passing range as if he wasn't. His defense is nothing special - do you watch the games? Many have said he is an All Defensive team caliber player, it was actually one of the things that surprised me once he got to the NBA (I did not expect him to be that good on defense). He has a lot to prove because if he doesn't he'll be traded at the blink of an eye.  Finally, hoping for 15, 5 &amp; 5 on good effiency as a MINIMUM is not mediocre for a second year player who is NOT a scorer in a team with LEBRON JAMES and other players that need the ball to be effective because they can't impact in other ways. He's not even in there top 5 scoring  options on the team. If I were to bump it up to 15-7-7, would that change anything (can most PG can do that?). There's dudes that could average those numbers but can they do it while playing good defense and creating+making their teammates better. Don't understand how that's a bad statline to want given the circumstances. The bad thing is that he's nowhere near that and putting up garbage numbers that Chuck and others rightly make fun of.  Understandably his assist numbers would be down in team with Rondo and LeBron. Last time I checked Draymond Green was averaging 10-7-7 going to All Star games. Stats aren't everything, geniune impact on games matter too. But people that don't watch games don't see those things because they only look at box scores.   You can say he's been a disappointment for a 2nd overall pick (but what about the 1st - who's value is virtually non-existent right now) and that is a fair+honest assessment but some players take a bit of time to develop in the NBA. By the end of Year 3 we will have a good idea of what he is or is going to be in this league.    "
"Hey Klay, you're one of my favorite players to watch when you get hot.  I have 3 questions for you.  A bit of a generic question but did you ever envision GSW being the dynasty it is now and what has the last 4 years of GSW dominance has meant to you personally? You always seem like one of the chillest dudes on the team and so laid back yet can come across as quite passionate. To me, the contrast is pretty stark making you stick out more (to me) than Draymond Green and Steph Curry.  And my 2nd question would be how did the loss against Cleveland in 2016 affect you as a professional player and your mindset towards competition? Particularly in the Finals where you made a jab towards Lebron James. To many spectators, this came across as rude and might have given a less than flattering impression of yourself as a person.  And my last question is: Are you satisfied with the success that you have had? Again, another generic question but again you don't seem like the type to care as much for the hype and the glory (?).  Thanks for having the AMA."

"Because he's not even a better scorer than Lebron. Kd has a lower career ppg in the regular and in the playoffs than Lebron. Just last year old man Lebron averaged more points than Kd in the regular season and in the playoffs.  Lebron has more 30, 40, 50, and 60 points games than Kd in the regular season *and* in the playoffs. Kd has never even cracked 60 points before in his whole career James Harden has a higher career high ffs."
"Hi Klay! Hope you are doing well!  1. What is it like playing against Lebron James and the Cavs for four straight finals?  2. Who is the better player, Steph or KD?  3. What are some advices that your father gave you throughout your nba career?  Good luck for the rest of your season!"
"&gt; Lastly, Giannis is a better scorer. He pretty much can score at will in the paint. Hes the greatest finisher in the league and possibly one of the best of all time.  ... You think Giannis is a better finisher than LeBron James? We'll see how Giannis holds up in the playoffs without a Three Point shot AGAIN. It's not rocket science my friend, and this isn't the 90s where your superstar doesn't need to know how to shoot. There is no planet where Giannis is better than Kawhi, you can support your guy all you want, but Kawhi is a tier above Giannis. No sense in continuing this when you're saying Giannis is a better finisher than LeBron and comparing him to fucking SHAQ."

"Thought I would have some fun writing this up, Bill was an amazing athlete and that's before you begin to talk about the huge cultural impact that he had on the sport and the US in general.    * The only season during his entire tenure that they dropped below 0.610 was in his final season at 34 years old (they went 0.585 and won a chip).   * He actually wasn't that inefficient. He was just playing in an inefficient era. He was top 5 for FG% 4/11 seasons. He also had a couple of seasons in the top 5 for assists and he helped run one of the most famous the fast-break offences in NBA history.    * Much like the Lebron-led Cavs, the Celtics struggled to show any signs of dominance without their main man. [Boston was a 35-win team \(-1.9 SRS\) in 28 games he missed from 1958-69, and for the other 915 games of his career they played at a 59-win pace \(6.4 SRS\).](http://www.backpicks.com/2018/04/02/backpicks-goat-3-bill-russell/)    * [He leads the league in DWS by a huge margin](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dws_career.html). The difference between him (1st at 133.64) and Tim Duncan (2nd at 106.34) is greater than the difference between Tim Duncan and David Robinson (10th at 80.4) which is greater than the difference between David Robinson and Charles Barkley (34th at 53.91).  * [When you look at DWS by season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dws_season.html), Bill Russell is 1st-6th, then 9th, 12th, 15th and 19th. He didn't have a single season that ranked outside the top 20 (all time) for DWS. He towered over guys who towered over guys who towered over the league.  * While people can make the old *he played against Milkmen* argument, the reality is that he was an athletic freak that was impressive by today's standards ([Bill](https://youtu.be/JWelUNrJUMM) vs [Giannis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okFx2IJImuo)).   * Bill talking about his own accomplishments in response to Lebron leaving him off his Mt Rushmore:  &gt;“Hey, thank you for leaving me off your Mount Rushmore. I’m glad you did. Basketball is a team game, it’s not for individual honors. I won back-to-back state championships in high school, back-to-back NCAA championships in college. I won an NBA championship my first year in the league, an NBA championship in my last year, and nine in between. That, Mr. James, is etched in stone.”  * When you talk about clutch players:    &gt;*[Over his basketball career, including college, Olympics and the NBA, Bill Russell participated in 21 games which, for lack of a better term, can be called “winner take all” games.

At which time he joins a team with a coach who had 16 years of never winning and a group of players who had never been to the finals. They won it all. Then lost in 7 with him injured the next finals.

"Bullshit. KD didn't create the first superteam. That happened in the 1980s. We should _want_ players to have agency to go wherever they choose. Too often young players are stuck in five year deals where the organization holds the keys to their fate (either by keeping them, cutting them, or tendering them in the fifth year option). KD did nothing wrong.   And if KD ""ruined the league"" then by modern standards so did -- Chris Paul (for forcing a trade), LeBron James (twice), Chris Bosh, LaMarcus Aldridge, and the list goes on and on. "

Let's dispell the fiction that LEBRON JAMES doesn't know what he's doing. 
"That reminds me of Steve Kerr calling the Cavs - Pistons Game 5 ECF game in 2007. Lebron of course famously scored 29 of Cleveland's final 30 points on route to a win and Kerr called a 22 year-old Lebron James ""Jordan-esque."" "
"&gt;Even with the boost of playing with LeBron James      [Fun Fact ; BI is significantly worse playing with LeBron](https://twitter.com/LakerFilmRoom/status/1067153275793793024)      -- Although, one could claim sample size as he has played with LeBron more than double (triple?) the amount of time without LeBron.      This is just the current trend.      Tonight, he didn't play well. That doesn't mean he always plays bad. However, I think this puts the Lakers in position to feel like trading BI won't be the worst Idea [regardless if it will make me sad]. I think the Lakers see that BI and LeBron aren't really meshing together and may decide to trade him because his value isn't really showing for the Lakers with this roster ; and if it keeps trending this way, why would you keep him when you have LeBron and he doesn't mesh with LeBron ?      That being said, I don't think they pull the trigger this year on any trade with BI unless it's in some sort of package for AD.          Lastly : BI isn't even CLOSE to a bust. C'mon man. The Lakers did not ""Whiff"" on the pick. The only ***obvious*** player that was better than BI in the draft was Ben Simmons ... who was chosen above him.  "

"LeBron James, yet another Lakers superstar forced to carry a bunch of corpses."
"The top 8 has been the same as people reckoned it was a year ago.  Lebron James is the best player in the world.   Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are #2 and #3, order undefined.  Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook are #4 through 8 in undefined order.  So asking if any of those last 5 players are in the ""top 5"" overall is a tricky question, every one of them over the past year has been at a point where most people would put them in the top 5.   Right now, I would guess for most people it looks something like: Lebron, Curry, KD, then 2 of Kawhi, Giannis, and Davis, with Harden and Westbrook at #7 and #8 right now."

"I expected this season to be LeBron heavy.... next year (when the bring in recuitment and their current players are hitting the full stride) LBJ can back off a bit.    But it's not like 'Cleveland' was playing badly the last four years: they made 4-straight finals while the Lakers were in the cellar.   I think Magic just wants LeBron to sell ticket and cruise into his Kareem/Showtime phase where he lets others guys to the heavy lifting and plays off the ball to preserve James for longer, since he's in his 30s and Magic wants him as a cornerstone for as long as possible.   I mean... they are just starting to build around LeBron and he's already two years past the age when Kobe won his last title, and it was futile to try to build around Kobe by that point.  "

"Low IQ as fck. The link shows you his point differentials over large samples of on court vs off court impact. Look at how they play when he is off the court, they can't even break 45 wins.   &gt; I like how you didn’t rebuttal any of the reasons how Steph is not as impactful as Durant or Leonard in as many areas.  Because it's nephew logic, anyone who knows the game know how moronic it is to view the game from a 2 way standpoint. James Harden is a more impactful player than Kawhi despite being a mediocre defender, every advanced statistics point to this. LeBron plays nearly 0 defense but he carries his team based on offensive impact alone. Point differentials take defense into account. Morons  "
"&gt;And Lebron James is not a point guard.  He's also not 7 feet and still the best player, but let's take one person and ignore the actual point of bringing up point guards.   &gt;If height was not the most important thing most stars would be 5 footers  So either it is the most important thing or it isn't. I'm confused, wasn't being tall all that mattered? Isn't skill a distant second? Then shouldn't all the best players automatically be the tallest ones? How come some of the shortest players in the league won MVPs and more importantly are considered some of the top players in the game (Curry and Westbrook, both 6'3"" which is way shorter than 7 feet)? Height is important; but it clearly it's not the only thing involved otherwise people like Curry and Westbrook wouldn't even be in the NBA, let alone be considered elite players. Based on your understanding of the game, literally everyone should be 7 feet soccer rejects, anyone under that height would basically be unable to compete. "
"Michael JEFFREY Nordan will never, EVER denounce let alone renounce his title as GOAT to anyone! not even to LeBron James!  ~Skip"
"&gt;Steph Curry is 6'3'' tall and you call him a midget?  Reading is really hard for you huh? This is what I said: ***""and he's a midget by your ""extremely"" tall standards""*** Apparently you think being in the NBA means you're automatically 7 feet, because that's all you mention every post.  &gt;there's only 1 point guard in the top 5 (he is third) of the MVP tracker  The more you post, the more you show how little you know about basketball. MVP isn't the ""best player"" award, because otherwise Lebron James would be winning it every year.

"Takeaways:  Atlanta - Baze continuing to look nice through RPM. Surprised to see Len/Dedmon look like an average big rotation through RPM. On the inverse, surprised to see the wing as low as it is with Prince but I guess their depth sucks and pg non existent even with Trae's passing at least keeping him afloat and JLin playing like a 6man candidate  BKN - Nothing too surprising. Allen has been good, guards have been good (Get back soon Caris) &amp; Dlo/Dinwiddie nice, Joe Harris is a splash daddy  Boston - Kyrie is an okay pg I think, and they good and deep everywhere else minus Brown's abysmal play killing their SG RPM it looks like  CHA - Has always been sorta well rounded and decent but just never had a 2nd star or facilitator to play with Kemba. Same ole story. Kemba playing like an All Star surrounded by decent role players. Like I like Zeller, Marvin, Lamb etc but in today's NBA you just need more firepower than a 1 man show and good role players/decent starters.  CHI - TIL RPM hates RoLo and WCJ....Also fucking no way thats Cam Payne, right?! Thats gotta be LaVine listed at pg...Also shouout to Justin Holiday having a good year   CLE - Who cares rn srs. Year 1 of a rebuild evident  DAL - SO WELL ROUNDED...LUKA!!!  DEN - Paul Millsap still an RPM god I see...Jokic and Harris obvious with their impact  DET - Roster is just a mediocre mess. They really need depth and wings. Where they get that from is gonna be the biggest unsolved question of the Blake/Drummond era with their draft positions and cap space  GS - Kevin Durant is good at basketball TIL  HOU - Per RPM Houston definitely needs to upgrade at SG or SF. That James Harden guy just not getting it done...Not sure if they have him as a SG or SF also if SG Eric Gordon is probably anchoring that RPM towards negative 0 if I had to guess for this season. Also thought Center would be higher bc I thought Capela and Tucker were RPM golden boys  IND - Predictable and well rounded. Spikes from Dipo and Sabonis prolly  LAC - Tobias is a rich man's Kevin Durant obviously, finally making the leap we saw the potential he could hit. DANILLO GALLINARI *heavy Italian voice*  Lakers - Lebron James is decent  Memphis - Gasol and Conely = Playoffs. They are symbolically the Spurs if the Spurs were only 2 players.  Miami - Boring team til those contracts expire. Great guard/wing depth evident.   MIL - Giannis. Khris. And Bledsoe??! just so well rounded   Min - RoCo and Drose the best players on this team obviously. It is known  NOP - AD/Niko front court killing it. Shoutout to Jrue &amp; 3Twuan, truly a top position group. Sucks they decided to play 3 v 5 this year tho with no wings or pgs  Knicks - Best Zo in the league   OKC - Does RPM hate Westbrook? I thought Shroeder + WB would be one of the top PG RPM's. Oh ya, PG is kinda good. SG and PF unsurprisingly bad. And Adams gotta be carrying that center position hard, 0 depth   ORL - Vuc  PHI - This is JJ Redick's team  Phx - :/  POR - Unsurprisingly deep and good   SAC - Ima a Big Buddy and Boggie fan. Good thing they are at least average in Center RPM. After drafting like their 11th lotto big man you'd hope so lol.    SAS - LaMarcus Aldridge, Pau Gasol, Davis Bertans - RPM HATES THEM! - Pg 34 5 reasons why...   DEEBO  TOR - Deeper and gooder than everybody. Sounds like Serge is still listed as a PF for some reason. Him and Siakam have been playing like border line All Stars which is why that position group is listed so elite.  UTA - Well rounded but avg and playing in the west with no elite shot creators  WAS - You could probably go to Dwight Howard orgy and pick out a more valuable center asset than Ian Mahimni. Especially if u paying him or her league min"

"OK, except that in this case what is being reported is that Walton and LeBron are now on the same page after a short adjustment period (which should be expected anytime a coach has a new star on his team). This is how that article finished:  &gt;Walton has adjusted, and now when James is running the show, Walton will typically just let him call the game. This probably shouldn't be considered a slight -- it's just James being James.  &gt; In fact, Walton has done a good job of limiting James' minutes and using the depth he has in the backcourt to attempt to ease the burden so James can be a bit fresher. He's averaging a career-low 35 minutes.  &gt; Even if it took a bit for Walton to figure out exactly how James was comfortable in the rotation. There was a game in Minnesota early in the season when Walton removed James just five minutes into the game in an effort to set the rotation so James could finish each quarter. James was, to put it mildly, mystified.  &gt; **Bottom line, things are trending more positively for the Lakers.** James getting back into his comfort zone, whether it was in the original game plan or not, is helping.  So there's no story here, but that hasn't stopped people like the OP from trying to invent drama where there is none. LeBron has had issues with coaches in the past, but he doesn't appear to be having any problems with Luke Walton, so there's no story here."

No. There are objective ways to measure basketball impact. LeBron James is objectively better at basketball that Cody Zeller.
"The OP either didn't pay very much attention [to what Windhorst wrote on this](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25384727/lebron-james-takes-control-lakers) (which is the source of this nonsense), or is just trying to twist it into drama for karma here. Windhorst said LeBron was running the offense and wasn't looking at the bench to get play calls. He said there had been times scouts thought LeBron *did* see plays called and ignored them, but he said Walton was just adjusting to having LeBron on the team and now just trusts him to run the offense when he's got the ball. So whatever ""drama"" there was between Walton and LeBron seems to have been minimal and is over with, but by all means, let's blow it up into ""LeBron wants Walton fired!"" and get some karma. "

Having LeBron James and Stephen Curry as the face of the NBA is about the best representation you will get  Pure class acts 
"Lol yes.  Two top three players on the same team especially when one is named Lebron James is a guaranteed title. Hence, look at the Warriors after getting KD. The only reason this duo wouldn't win a ring is if the rest of the roster consisted of middle school kids who've never touched a basketball for the first time in their life and even then I'd imagine Lebron would somehow make them into a gang of reliable catch and shoot-ers."
"Here's what I've got.  1st team: Kemba Walker, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James  2nd team: James Harden, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard  3rd team: Russell Westbrook, DeMar Derozan, Nikola Jokic, Blake Griffin, Paul George"
"All the advance stats you listed are heavily influence by a team's success, so I believe they don't tell the whole story. I personally value individual performance above team performance and his personal stats are not that outstanding that is why I am counting him out. As for the MVP tracker, they place Kyle Lowry at number three, ahead of Joel Embiid and Lebron James, which is a very questionable decision. I have no idea how they get/calculate the result, but from the looks of it, team success play a very big role as well.  On a side note. VORP and RPM are both slight variations of BPM. While WS and WS/48 are almost the same thing. You can't just use them as if they are all different stats :)"

You know who else can't guard LeBron James? 95% of the league."

Also, why Spurs have no chance at the title for the next 10 years.  4) Fultz could be the worst shooter in the history.  5) Why the Cavs should never trade Lebron James to the Chicago Bulls.  6) Why Harden will be the MVP this year."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.

"Right now I would rank them:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Lebron James 3. James Harden 4. Giannis Antekoumpo 5. Kevin Durant  I think that's the clear Top 5.  Then for the next 5, you have probably Westbrook, Butler, DeRozan, Davis, Kyrie, and Towns as the next group, and it's hard to sort out those players. Kawhi would probably be #5, ahead of Durant if he were healthy this year. "
"For the opposing players question, one nominee for the modern era would be LeBron James and Al Jefferson in 2014. LeBron scored 61 but Al Jefferson had something like 39/22 in that game. Pretty sure they combined for 100/30/10 or something like that. Could've been much higher if it wasn't a blowout. Those Heat teams straight up couldn't guard Professor Albus"
"Honestly by now I probably would have tried to strong arm James to commit or quit by threatening to trade Love and other supporting pieces. Teams need to have a long term plan.   If he states he wants to leave, I work with him to find a trade destination so I can get something (like the CP3 trade) and trade the other pieces like Love.   If he remains quiet then I trade Love and the other pieces and change my marketing plan to selling the last run of the Lebron-Wade show. I doubt he refuses to play since it would hurt his legacy to much.   If he explicitly says he wants to stay I get him to sign a two year contract extension and give him input over what trades he wants to make. Long term I don’t think this roster is built to allow an againg Lebron compete for rings. I feel it needs a legit young star to take a bigger role (this was supposed to be Kyrie) and you trade Love + BKN pick for him.   Side Notes: Do I want to trade one of the greatest players ever? No, but you also have to think about the best interests of your team and by now you’ve probably made enough money on Lebron multiple times over. He’s left once and the fact that he hasn’t committed is likely a sign that he’s gone. If your GF is going to dump you and you know it, plan accordingly. "

If we discount the injury bullshit of 2015, and the Warrioirs+KD overkill of 2017, that’s still 3 losses, two of which were lopsided beatdowns, whereas the 3rd was a total chokejob.  On the bighest stage, under the brightest lights, against the best opponents, Jordan never lost. That’s something worth rating as highly as it is.  That being said, Lebron James is a consensus top-3 player (imo top-2) of all time and the “Jordon never lost, but James did” argument, in mainstream media, is butchered heavily and deserves a bit more nuance"
"""*""Look to my coming, at first light, on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.*"" - Lebron James to Kyrie Irving, circa 2017 NBA offseason"
You don't get to call a team with Lebron James on it spooky. That's at least misdemeanor meme abuse. 
"In the '15-16 season Marcus Morris held LeBron to league low of 20.5 pts per 100 possessions among 43 defenders with over 50 matchups. Kawhi led league in '16-17 . Morris didn't do as well that year or even this (still 9th in 55 matchups over just 2 games this regular season) but today showed he studied Kawhi's defensea of LeBron and tried to emulate Kawhi's strategic hand use. Is he the Kingslayer? Doubtful. Still Kawhi's record has been the best, Jimmy Butler closest at 2nd.. but Morris as he showed is no slouch. [From this Hardwood Houdini article which is hindsight seems almost prophetic talking about the ECF and comparing Morris with Kawhi:](https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2017/09/26/marcus-morris-bostons-lebron-stopper/)  &gt;Marcus Morris might be a potential solution to the LeBron problem. Morris was acquired from the Detroit Pistons earlier this summer. He’s a versatile combo forward and a potentially perfect foil to LeBron.     &gt;Morris has had some success containing LeBron in one-on-one matchups over the previous two seasons. In fact, certain advanced statistics seem to indicate that Morris has been one of the best players in the league at defending LeBron.  &gt;In the 2015-2016 season, Morris held LeBron to just 20.5 points per 100 possessions, according to Nik DeCosta-Klipa. In that same season, LeBron averaged 36.5 points per 100 possessions. Based strictly on this metric, Morris was the best player in the league at defending King James.  &gt;Unfortunately, Morris didn’t have as much luck against LeBron in the 2016-2017 season, letting LeBron get 35.5 points per 100 possessions. Even so, this number was still on par with the rest of the league’s purported LeBron stoppers. Morris kept up with Kawhi Leonard, Jae Crowder, and actually did better than PJ Tucker and Andre Iguodala. How has Marcus Morris had such success defending LeBron?  &gt;**Length, Strength, and Quickness**  &gt;At 6'9 and almost 240 pounds, Morris has the requisite length and strength to bother LeBron. This, combined with stellar lateral quickness, means that Morris is long enough to contest shots, just strong enough to hold ground, and fast enough to cut LBJ off.  &gt;**The Intangibles** &gt;Spatial awareness has been absolutely crucial in making the most of Morris on the defensive side of the floor, especially against LeBron in one-on-one matchups.  &gt;Based on the above video, Morris found some success defending LeBron through the use of his arms, using them as a way to maintain spacing. He doesn’t get too close to LeBron, nor does he play off of him extensively. Rather, Morris mostly kept LeBron just a hair further than his arm’s length away, affording him extra space (read, time) to react to LeBron’s moves while also enabling him to contest a shot if LeBron decided to pull up.  &gt;The benefit of having a nearly seven-foot wingspan is apparent here. Besides having allowed Morris to more easily block passing lanes or contest shots, the misrepresentation of space appears to entice LeBron into taking long perimeter jump shots, which Morris would then contest.  &gt;Clearly, a general sense of defensive awareness has also helped Morris defend LeBron. In the above video, Morris mostly ducks under screens as opposed to chasing LeBron over. Morris seemingly recognized that LeBron was less dangerous shooting from the perimeter than moving downhill towards the rim. The catch, Morris is long enough and fast enough to contest LeBron’s shot anyway, despite typically going under screens.  &gt;**Tips from the Claw**  &gt;In order for Morris to reattain the level of success he had defending LeBron in previous years, he could take a few tips from the Claw.  &gt;Kawhi Leonard is probably the best perimeter defender in the NBA. He’s won the Defensive Player of the Year award on two occasions and has been in contention nearly his entire career.  &gt;He’s won the respect of nearly every player in the league, including LeBron, who has actually voiced his displeasure at having to go against Kawhi. According to Marcel Mutoni, LeBron has actually said that Kawhi defends him best.  &gt;The metrics from recent years back this up as well.  &gt;In the 2016-2017 season, Kawhi held LeBron to one of the lowest points per 100 possession totals in the league. He’s done a good job at contesting LeBron’s shots and has also forced plenty of turnovers.  &gt;So, what could Marcus Morris learn by watching Kawhi defend LeBron?  &gt;In addition to having done everything that Morris did, and having done it well, Kawhi very deliberately used his hands, not just to maintain spacing, but to put pressure on the ball.  &gt;Kawhi appears to like keeping LeBron within an arm’s length away, allowing him plenty of opportunities to lunge at the ball right before LeBron would make his move. Doing this afforded Kawhi two advantages in his matchups with LeBron. First, he was able to force the odd turnover. And second, Kawhi was able to force LeBron to readjust his dribble, which put LeBron slightly off balance and disrupted his rhythm.  &gt;In theory, this is the most effective form of defence. In reality, it boasts several obvious benefits as well. When Kawhi tried to deny LeBron on the perimeter or in the post, it essentially disrupted the flow of the offence and put LeBron’s teammates in a situation where they’re more likely to make a mistake. Having to constantly battle for position is also exhausting and could realistically hinder a player’s offensive performance.  &gt;Marcus Morris has all the tools needed to contain LeBron, and taking tips from Kawhi might actually help him guard LeBron more effectively. If Morris learns to use his hands in a more active manner and attempts to deny LeBron the ball on occasion, he could be Boston’s answer to the LeBron problem come the 2017-2018 Eastern Conference Finals."
"LeBron is single handily carrying this team. Love was a no show until what, game two or three against Toronto? He didn't shit against Indy. It's the same thing with both teams; they are winning but only because of James. I mean, look at the minutes he's playing..."
Just trade Kyrie for LeBron James. You have enough guards. Lol
Well since no human being has ever won alone I figured that nobody would be dumb enough to assume I meant LeBron James and only LeBron James won the 2012 and 2013 championships 
I think the LeBron James hype has been a little bit overblown....i still think he is a silent ownership partner in BSPN
Brad Stevens vs Lebron James UFC 225? Book it Dana!
He's also not going to go west to a big town just to scrape into the playoffs   If he was worried about not being marketable he wouldn't still be in Cleveland. He's LeBron James it doesn't matter where he plays
"Orlando needs to let Gordon go then commit to yet another fire sale to restart the team.  Cleveland will be fine if LeBron leaves but if he does they need to find suitors for everyone on the team ASAP outside of the potential 8th pick. Pick should be used on high upside player. If the Cavs finish in the bottom 10, they'll be able to claim their pick from Atlanta.  Bucks need to get rid of Snell/Dellavedova in a package with Maker. Team needs to be building to win now. I'd go so far as to try and get Aldridge from the Spurs if that team trades Leonard away. Aldridge will give them a low post threat on top of the marksman like shooting Bledsoe brings to the team. Maker, Snell, first rounder and Henson for Aldridge. They'd have to re-sign Parker unfortunately just to maintain a strong starting 5. The bench will have to be composed of a bunch of league minimum deals. Jennings re-signed, Brogdon, Zeller is a decent start. Trading Delly is important if Jennings stays. They need some combo forward to come off the pine for flexibility.   Knicks will be embracing that tank. Mudiay and Burke were good pickups during the later stages of last year. They've got a few overpaid vets who they could look to trade out come the deadline. Maybe not Kanter but Lee and Hardaway could be moved at a certain point, especially Hardaway as it'll be likely he become ""the guy"" for them and could easily hoist 15-20 shots a night next season.  Nets will yield a competitive roster again. I don't think they've got the means to look for more trades to garner picks. This is their last draft without their own pick. It'll of course be a season where all eyes are on Russell and not a whole lot else.  Grizzlies and Mavs I believe are both capable of looking to get back into the playoff race next year. Mavs will have some space to go for someone and along with the #3 pick they could have the chance to surprise people. Grizzlies are in the same boat. No one is taking that Parsons deal but if Conley can stay healthy for a majority of a season, the team can still play .500 ball. They've found some decent pickups this last season that can help them. Both teams are capable of just accepting a reset for their teams.   There are a lot of players expiring from the Spurs this offseason. Their entire frontcourt bench is set to leave and Manu and Tony are off the books as well. Aldridge, Leonard and Gasol are all attractive for several teams.  I think Kings are on the right path. Bogdanovic, Fox, Mason II, Cauley-Stein, Hield, Jackson, Giles and Labissiere are 8 guys that are all likely to be on the team for the next few years likely. I think they very well could end up getting Porter, Bamba or Carter. Best fit for me has to be Porter. But if not then Bamba is probably the best way to go.  They'll like be bottom 10 again next year and that final player should push them over the hump a little bit but they might not be looking for playoffs until 2020-2021.  And the Northwest just yeah.    I'm super pumped for a few teams next year.  I've got the feeling the West playoff teams are gonna fall in terms of wins.  I've got Houston, New Orleans making playoffs from Southwest.  Golden State, both LA teams making it from Pacific.  Utah, Portland, and Denver, too from Northwest.  Memphis and Dallas should win around 35. San Antonio post Leonard trade should win half.  Phoenix and Sacramento will still be sub 30 win teams.  Minny and OKC should win 35-half their games.  I'm entirely convinced Minny bench is going to hold them back too much. OKC cannot upgrade the roster at all.   For that east i've got every single team that made playoffs this season going into playoffs again next year. In fact I think the standings at the bottom don't change much.  Detroit and Charlotte will win the same amount of games if not a little less. Chicago and Brooklyn will win a little more. Atlanta, Orlando and New York will all win 20-25.  For the playoff seedings all 3 Atlantic teams claim the top 3 slots.  Washington and Miami will claim the bottom slots.  The Central teams claim the middle slots.  If Cleveland loses James I still see them making it. They'll probably claim the 8th."
That's precisely what Lebron James did when he went to Miami. He basically avoided competition from Wade and Bosh. You automatically improve if you can dismantle another team.
LeBron. James.

"you got LeBron James here, who's gonna have a 20 year career with at least 3 rings. And then you got Brad Stevens here, who's gonna coach for 30 something years and you have no idea how many rings he'll win. Oh, not to mention, LeBron brings in millions in extra revenue. "
"Lol 'handful'. You don't have to agree with an opinion to understand it's popular dude, you're actually delusional if you think only a small minority of people think Lebron is the one of the GOAT.   I'll even give you examples because I have free time.  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/ranking-the-25-greatest-players-in-nba-history-100716  Fox Sports put Lebron as #2, and I'm willing to bet a few people got to input their opinions into that poll.  https://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/the-top-nba-players-of-all-time  This one was ranked by random people and has Lebron #3.  https://www.statista.com/statistics/612623/greatest-nba-player-of-all-time/  This poll, also by random people, has Lebron as #3 of all time.   https://www.si.com/nba/2016/02/09/michael-jordan-lebron-james-stephen-curry-nba-greatest  Sports Illustrated has him at #5. I would consider top 5 as arguably the greatest of all time.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cbs-sports-50-greatest-nba-players-of-all-time-where-do-lebron-curry-rank/  CBS Sports has him at #2  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankalltime/greatest-players-ever  ESPN has Lebron at #3.   https://www.britannica.com/list/the-10-greatest-basketball-players-of-all-time  Hey would you look at fuckin that, this list has Lebron at #1 all time. It's almost like it's an opinion and they're both in the same conversations for a reason!  So yeah, once again, you can believe what you want, but if you think that the *overwhelming* majority of people who watch basketball don't think LeBron James is one of the best players of all time, you are fucking incorrect.  "
"Literally though. There was an article recently talking about how he is one of the slowest players in the league this year in average speed. It’s intentional. He is “actively resting” by choosing when to run back to conserve energy so he can play more total minutes because the Cavs get killed when he’s off the floor. Ill try to dig up the article.  Edit: [ Cavaliers are surviving in the playoffs despite the dilemma of LeBron James' rest](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23384071/lebron-james-plays-rests-keep-cleveland-cavaliers-hopes-alive)  &gt;James has perfected the art of resting while playing.  &gt;It's a concept high-energy athletes such as boxers and swimmers have used for years: looking for moments in competition in which they can ease their load and allow for little scraps of rest they hope will add up. For James, this means finding times within games when he can catch his breath even when play is going on.  &gt;He has been slowly learning how to do it for years.  &gt;""It's just about growing, maturing and understanding that you play smarter,"" James said. ""It's not like you're out there and you say, 'OK, I'm not going to get back on defense here. Not going to do this here.' It's just about picking your spots."""
James harden and lebron* sorry forgot to mention the beard 
I see you're new to basketball. May I introduce you to James Harden. The fact that you think LeBron gets even half the help that man gets shows you aren't really up to basketball debate levels of knowledge
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
"Edit: **24 teams are interested in trading for Kawhi Leonard, signing Lebron James.**"
"You know how ridiculous you sound, right? Lebron and Jordan are super close, depending on exactly what you value. I'd take James over Jordan, but acting like it's not even close is silly. And it's silly to denigrate Lebron over a game one performance, especially in light of how incredible he has been this postseason."
"Not as sad as the people who are waiting to see Lebron James fail one time so they can feel justified in hating him. Famous last words of people who win game 1 of a 7-game series: ""It's over"""
And yet another game to prove why Jordan was and will always be light years ahead of Lebron James. Before anyone comments let me point you out to his finals record. Thank you. 
"I'm amazed at how many people still don't understand how to evaluate a basketball game. Everyone on Twitter was like *Kevin Love! Dayum!  But LeBron though, wtf?!?"".       Peep this folks, we can be extremely empirical about this. In terms of overall Cav points vs. Celtics points (not ridiculous plus/minus because that's not necessarily tied to your effort). Love had 17 pts. James had 15. Love had one more rebound. Since a rebound is a new possession, and because 90% of possessions end in a shot attempt, and because 80% of all shots are two pointers which fall 45% of the time, and 20% are 3 pointers that fall 23% of the time (which are long term NBA averages). Then a new possession is worth .9x((.8x(.45x2))+(.2x(.23x3)))=.7722 points. So after one rebound Love has contributed (17 Love pts - 15 LBJ pts) + (.7722 pts off his rebound). Or 2.772 pts more than James. James also had six more turnovers (which are also new possessions for BOS so they are called at the same 0.7722 pts). So with turnovers and the rebound Love is ahead of James 7.4 ""team"" points. But LeBron had six more assists. And assists net a team about 2.2 points on average. And 6 means LeBron contributed 13.2 more points through assists than Love did. That's 3.8 team points more than Love contributed. And it's not even including the fact love had more fouls, and less blocks. Don't get me wrong Lebron sucked vs. his normal caliber of play, but even in this game LeBron ACTUALLY did more (overall) to help his team win. LeBron didn't have a great game, but let's be honest here the cavs didn't lose because LeBron sucked. They sucked because app of them collectively (including LeBron and Love) sucked. "

Who’s LeBron James?
"Better than LeBron fucking James? How can you believe this? I'm a Pacers fan, I watched the fucker for years. He's a drama queen who can ball but can also become cancerous real fast when his game isn't on point and/or he doesn't get his way. He isn't clutch and has a very bad habit of disappearing when teams need him most. He has no loyalty and I don't see him as a great mentor to the younger, blooming players on the 76ers. PG wants to be the headline. "
"Fun is not something one considers after getting swept by Lebron James, But this does put a smile on my face "

Looks like LeBron James just Dad dicked you and the entire cavs fan base lmao 
Ben Simmons was just a warm up for Lebron James
"Hell no lmao. This entire series is a “prove it” session for the Celtics. You are disrespecting Lebron’s greatness OP.   First for you Lebron haters that are dickriding he Celtics after game 1,  y’all motherfuckers have disappeared for the last 7 Years this man keeps dad dicking the whole conference and y’all are in fucking denial.   Second for the Celtics fans and people who want to genuinely see them succeed, this was one Game. Don’t for a second think you’ve got an edge over Lebron James, he has a track record of greatness and your Celtics are simply in the way. For us to take your team seriously you need to Prove you can step up and beat Lebron in a series, not before. Showboating and frontrunning after winning game 1 is rookie mistake. Ask GSW, ask the Pacers all those years, ask the Spurs, etc. they won game 1 before and got ended by greatness. So keep your hopes in check. "
"Certain players cause lebron to struggle individually, Marcus Morris is one of them. James Johnson you can add to that list. The Celtics as a whole are so disciplined defensively, you can a couple more players from that team alone."
I mean this is Lebron James we’re talking about.

The Boston Celtics have more postseason wins against Lebron James (14) than any other team in NBA history. They are also tied for most playoff series wins against Lebron James with the Warriors and Spurs at 2. 
LeBron James -32 that's crazy. I don't pay attention to those numbers that often but I don't think I've seen that stat be so low for anyone before 
"Holy fucking shit I did not think this sub could blow Kawhi harder than it already does but once again it continues to top itself.  Can we stop overrating Kawhi? Yes he is a great player, probably top 5 or top 10 in the league; he has HoF/pyramid potential (and I mean real HoFer not this Mitch Richmond horseshit) and is already well on his way there. But to even ENTERTAIN this idea is fucking ludicrous. LeBron James is at least a top 5 player all time, probably top 3 or top 2, arguably the best ever. I don’t give a fuck about his age when the gap in ability is that wide.   Also, who knows when Kawhi is going to decide he wants to get the fuck outta Cleveland and start ghosting the team. At least with LeBron you have a guarantee that the guy will fucking show up.  FOH with this nonsense."
"&gt; I like how you can't read or comprehend what LIKELY means.  Lol I get what LIKELY means. I'm arguing it's UNLIKELY and ^^ are the reasons why.   &gt; Also for how great Simmons is he is not a great pairing with Lebron  1) [Lebron might want to play offball more](https://247sports.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/Bolt/Report-LeBron-James-wants-to-play-off-ball-wherever-he-plays-next-season--118059152)  2) Simmons is most effective after the ball has left his hands. The cool thing about Simmons is that instead of ""clogging the mididle"" when teams sags, he [makes/finds interior passing lanes]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT4TWMCMLE0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m50s) in motion for guys like Saric. If Saric was 10% the finisher that James is, he would've put up 25 a game. Basketball is more complicated than ""if he has ball, I can't have""  3) [Lebron thinks highly of Simmons](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2762278-lebron-james-touts-young-king-ben-simmons-on-instagram-after-76ers-beat-cavs). I'd trust LBJ's opinion more than hot-takes and internet trolls"
Furthers my point exactly. Kawhi wasn’t even in his prime and was a finals mvp while beating LeBron James. I’ll take 14ppg Kawhi over Prime Melo and I’m a Melo fan y’all severely underestimating how good Kawhi is

"No, because every time he plays in Boston he is reminded that former Celtics draft pick and combo guard legend Delonte West had carnal relations with his mom Gloria. To make matters worse it was pretty clear over the course of Delonte's career that he had the herp, so there is an outside chance that Delonte West gave Lebron James' mom herpes. "
"Ill entertain your idea  LeBron in Boston would negate whatever Stevens brings to the table. Jaylen and Jayson would turn into spot up shooters, and Horford would enter the same Twilight Zone that Kevin Love has been in.   If Ainge makes some big move it will be for AD. Not James or PG13"

"OMG HOLY SHIT WTF MY GOD LEBRON JAMES CAN REMEMBER A BASKETBALL GAME THAT HE JUST FINISHED 20 MINUTES AFTERWARDS. Lol, who cares. "
I don't think LeBron James is going to have a bad series and he really hasn't against the Celtics and Brad Stevens in the past at all.   The way the Celtics game-planned Simmons was honestly completely different from LeBron.   They literally just left Ben and camped in the paint and they'd meet him when he drove at them.    That's the kind of thing that's going to be usable by any team in the league.  If anything Brad Stevens showed that teams are respecting his range way too much.  Just put a big on him and camp in the paint.   If he does have a bad series though it will be more because of Marcus Morris and his LeBron stopper thing somehow coming true though lol.

"&gt;  If Lebron agrees to sign it will LIKELY be with the assumption you're also bringing in another Superstar  Why? Where else can he go that has better superstar talent than Embiid/Simmons? Houston's about it. Maybe New Orleans. LBJ signing is not contingent on Kawhi signing.  Also given [Simmons' and Lebron's closeness](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/27/16706084/lebron-james-ben-simmons-friends-basketball-76ers-cavaliers), I would guess Simmons would be contingency for Lebron joining."
what the fuck does that mean Lebron James
"I said this before the game, but not here, so it's not a Johnny-come-lately thing.  But, it seems like people might be overrating the Cavs based on sweeping Toronto.  Lebron's the best in the league, hands-down, and they're still the favorites, but they're really not a great team.  K Love is good, but he seems to disappear every other game, and doesn't seem capable of carrying them if James isn't playing well.  The rest of the team is pretty average.    They'll go as far as Lebron takes them.  But, the reality is when you have a team like that, strategizing to make everyone else beat you is the way to go.  If there's one thing that can get you there, it's good coaching, because they can scheme it up.    I dunno, the sweep in Toronto doesn't mean much more than taking 7 to beat the Pacers.  They're vulnerable, in my opinion."

It’s probably no surprise when looking at this season and career numbers, the latter with a minimum 100 technical free attempts since 1999-00, that LeBron James has recorded the worst technical free throw percentage:  "
"The reason that Boston is dominating them is because they are a better team, with better players.  Kevin Love is good. Tristan Thompson is also good, if limited to doing a few things. The rest of the Cavs are, to put it bluntly, garbage.  Korver, Smith, Hill, Hood, Green, Clarkson. That isn't a good group of players. Lebron was never going to overcome that this season.   As for a solid strategy for how Lebron James, one of the top 3 players of all time, will co-exist with another great player, I can't believe what I'm hearing. How did he co-exist with D Wade, a guy who also didn't shoot 3s.  Just put Lebron in the same position and role as Dario Saric, alongside Simmons, Redick, Covington and Embiid. Or, Saric instead of RoCo. Plenty of shooting, absurd rim attackers in Lebron and Simmons, Embiid as the focal point in the middle.  It would be a top 3 offense in the league right away. No problem at all.  Teams already know Simmons can't shoot. He was effective all the same. If you add Lebron James to his team, HE WILL BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE. "
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?   edit: wtf I got gold for a fucking copypasta "

"to people saying ""everyone does this"" or ""everyone in the history of the nba does this"":  you're liars. blatantly, and over the dumbest shit imaginable. almost NO players in the league RIGHT NOW commit lane violations on free throws. almost NO ONE in league history commits lane violations on free throws. stop making up fake shit.  i don't care if it's lebron james or arron baynes or michael jordan or anyone else. a lane violation is a lane violation. it's a rule. and saying everyone does it is a lie. what the fuck is wrong with y'all.  EDIT: only editing to specify ""no SHOOTERS commit lane violations on free throws."" you'd think that would go without saying that that's what i meant considering that's what the original post is about, and yet my replies are full of people operating at a 1st grade reading level."
Lmfao me saying Lebron James shouldn’t have a bad performance like this means I’m cancer? Holy fuck you bronsexuals are so emotional and pathetic.

"LeBron James yelled, “There we blow!” LeBron James gave a look of intense disgust. LeBron James belted, “We got a fucking problem now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Cav LeBron James hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so shitty now”."
"Forget the blowout, I just witnessed Marcus Morris outscore Lebron James in a playoff game. What the hell."
"That's because Simmons' lack of shooting is the main problem. And you don't seem to understand the difference between what Simmons brings vs. what Irving and Wade brought to compliment James. Kyrie was an elite shooter that perfectly complimented James, and Wade was a threat on and off the ball as well. He was an elite shooter from midrange who forced 3s when necessary. he was also one of the league's best cutters. He ALSO was a ball handler who could get to the basket off isolation play and pick and rolls. Simmons refuses to shoot. Using him as a cutter negates his passing. Putting him on the ball means Lebron is a spot up shooter, which isn't his specialty, or a screener, which could be an interesting role but again, teams will just back off simmons. I've yet to hear a detailed explanation of how a Simmons-Lebron pairing will work on the court."
You honestly believe that if LeBron goes to the Lakers he is going to even attempt to put up with the Lavar Ball nonsense? Zero chance. So Lonzo leaving would be a contingency of LeBron coming. You think Magic would choose Lonzo Ball over LeBron fucking James?

"33 teams have faced a 3 to 1 deficit in the NBA finals. Only one team has ever overcome this deficit and they did so against the winningest team in NBA history. You can argue other achievements are comparable or better but to say ""it's definitely not"" is fucking retarded to put simply.   Also the only All-star on the Cavaliers in 2016 was Lebron James."

"&gt; LeBron James was asked about his thoughts on the huge trade that went down on Monday involving Blake Griffin going to the Detroit Pistons. As you may have heard, the Clippers told Griffin they wanted him to be a “Clipper for life” this past summer before eventually trading him.  &gt; By now you’ve probably heard the saying “Sports Are A Business” so much that it shouldn’t be news to anyone. Team courts player, player buys in knowing full well the possibilities of said buying in, team flips player for the future. And unless you’re a child, you know the score by now.  &gt; But James, being the most well-known player in the league and a pioneer in flexing his autonomy discussed the perception that teams do “the right thing for the franchise” when they trade someone like Griffin but when a player decides to move on, the narrative isn’t so forgiving.  &gt; “When a player gets traded, they were doing what’s best for the franchise,” James told reporters at shootaround. “Then when a player decides to leave he’s not loyal, he’s a snake, he’s not committed. That’s the narrative of how it goes. I know that first hand.”  &gt; The dysfunction around the Cavaliers is at new levels. Dan Gilbert is reportedly calling the shots in the basketball ops department and it appears that general manager Koby Altman is nothing more than a figurehead.  &gt; James brings his own drama with him but the current Cavs dysfunction goes way beyond the way James’ presence magnifies every little thing that goes on in the Cavs locker room.  &gt; Could be he setting the stage for another July exit from Northeast Ohio? With a non-basketball mind in Gilbert taking control of things, players being uninformed of the absence of an All-Star and communication lacking all over the place, it would be hard to blame him if that’s the conclusion he reaches. Again.  Full text for those on mobile/too lazy to click."
"He did try, but *LeBron James*, one of the best defensive forwards in 2012/2013, should be able to play elite defense in the finals. He's either not trying hard enough, or his defense has declined due to age."
"......... This is why Bron stans are one of the worst on this sub.  You are absolutely joking right?   You don't think Lebron was underwhelming when he shot 47.5% TS with 27 points? Look efficiency isn't everything, but come on LOL.  You cannot give me plus/minus when Lebron James had the second lowest plus minus out of Cavs starter... Come on homie LOL.  Finally, to put this stupidity to rest, Lebron was horrific defensively that game, outside that one block; Before you try to argue your ass outta this one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZYyvMsdZic  Green scored 32, while Lebron looked LOST defensively; Yes, Green was Lebron's assignment.   Oh, Curry played very poorly. But can I ask you a question? If Steph was remotely healthy in 2016, how come he couldn't blow by Thompson or Love in 2016, but could consistently do it in 2017? Curry looked noticeably slow man... Are you perhaps arguing this as well?  I cannot believe someone on this sub is claiming Bron wasn't underwhelming in game 7:  He was actually a NEGATIVE net rating that game, and he was the ONLY starter to be that way:  https://stats.nba.com/players/advanced/?sort=OFF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;DateFrom=06%2F18%2F2016&amp;DateTo=01%2F04%2F2018&amp;PORound=4&amp;TeamID=1610612739  I do hope you are just trolling me tho."

"If you go by playstyle, rookie Blake Griffin was a lot more exciting than rookie LeBron James. They were both good, but Blake was a threat to jam on somebody any time he had a bit of steam. LeBron was kinda small and made a lot more agile moves. If you like Dunks, Blake was more entertaining."
"I think it's fair to say Blake Griffin was, as, or more exciting as a rookie than LeBron James. I certainly would not call someone delusional for having that opinion.  LeBron's greatness coming into the league was an expectation. Blake Griffin, although a #1 pick, was not expected to come into the league as explosive as he did. His rookie year was incredible."
"You can play elite defense on guys like Steph, LeBron, etc... and they will still make shots or get the ball to someone who will. You can make an argument for elite team defense being more important than being an elite offensive team, but there's a reason why James Harden gets paid the big bucks and Tony Allen does not. "

Blake Griffin is not Lebron James 
"Blake Griffin was the most exciting rookie of the last 20 years.  He had flash and energy of young Vince Carter and filled up the stat sheet more than a rookie LeBron James.  Even though he never lived up to some of the gigantic expectations placed onto him after that season, I'll always be grateful for being able to watch him play for the Clippers.  He was one of the most ferocious animal monsters I have ever seen attack a basket, and you those don't come around very often.  You're right about most important Clipper, and I hope the fans all respect what he did for the franchise.  "
LeBron James and rattling ~~rims~~ in clutch moments oops
Homeless man's Lebron James
Did you not read the bit where he said mediocrity was ok? Especially for a team like Detroit that will never attract a LeBron James or Kevin Durant. For teams like this it's ok. The Grit and Grind era for the Grizzlies hasn't been a failure because we didn't win a chip or even make it to the finals. We won a lot of games had packed playoff crowd and most importantly had some damn good basketball to watch just because it wasn't in the finals doesn't make some of those games any less exciting to watch.
Will LeBron James go to OKC next season to help them in a championship just like how Kevin Durant went to GSW?
"So the Front Office built this team?  That being said, regarding your point about Green.  Mark did a FANTASTIC job with Green. He actually started and provided minutes for Green despite putting up horrific offensive numbers and was the first to start the traction for his current career.  To put this in perspective, he gave Green 22 minutes per game in 2014 (Despite being absolute trash offensively) and he was given minutes even before that, (When he was HUGELY negative offensively). So I have no fucking clue why you are saying:  ""He had draymond glued to the bench.""  Look, I know revisionist history is rampant on this sub, but my god. Mark Jackson did a great job with Green; Green was one of the worst offensive players on that roster and Mark trusted him to get minutes. What else did you want? He made Andre Roberson look like an offensive all-star... that's how bad he was on that end.  Green was given minutes that MOST coaches wouldn't give him;  I mean, under 50% TS as a 3rd/4th option from the Bench?  Come on homie.

"Draft grades are hilarious:   - Bill Simmons Draft Diary (RIP Grantland): Our no. 1 pick? Yup … Kyrie Irving. You know, because any time you can grab a freshman point guard who missed two-thirds of the season when you have $20 million of point guards on your roster, you have to do it. We’ll see how this goes: I see him settling somewhere between an extremely poor man’s Chris Paul and a rich man’s Mike Conley. Will he ever make an All-Star team? It’s possible … maybe one or two. One thing I don’t understand: Why does everyone keep saying this month that you “need” a good point guard to win? Didn’t anyone watch Jason Kidd and Mario Chalmers just battle in the Finals? You need good players to win. I believe Derrick Williams will be a more effective professional basketball player than Kyrie Irving. We will see.    - Bleacher Report: Grade: B. Kyrie Irving may end up being a solid NBA point guard, but Derrick Williams has more talent and would have been a better fit for the team.    - SI: Grade: B-: It's tough to blame the Cavs for not landing more star-caliber talent in a draft that was historically low on it, but they still fell short. Kyrie Irving was the safe pick at No. 1, but taking dynamic forward Derrick Williams might have been the better play. Add in the facts that Cleveland has a glaring need at the position and a fan base that needs its own young star to help them forget about LeBron James, and it seems all the more likely that we might look at this pick sideways down the road. What's more, we now know that the Cavs could have had Kentucky's Brandon Knight to fill the point guard need with a high-level player there. Only time will tell if they missed out on a star in Jonas Valanciunas as well. They were expected to take the Lithuanian center but concerns over his contract and when he will actually play in the NBA scared them off. "

CP3 was going to leave anyway so a parting gift was the best we could hope for and Montrezl Harrell, Lou Williams (who we may trade if we actually commit to tanking to get our own lottery pick), Pat Beverly, and Sam Dekker are bonafide assets. Don't forget, we got a first round pick out of that as well.   Blake's trade may be a little more difficult to understand right now but it was something I was hoping for. My friend is good friends with one of the trainers on the Clippers staff and he basically said that Blake is done in terms of explosiveness. Any Clipper fan who regularly watches games can probably tell by now that he doesn't elevate the way he used to. His game is now built on strength, skill, and anticipation; and it's worked out for him thus far. But with the already diminishing athleticism he has left, people on the staff really believed he had probably 2 years of this level of productivity left. I knew we needed to trade him while we could get something worthwhile in return.   So what does West do? The unthinkable if you're Doc Rivers or, to be fair, almost any other front office executive in the NBA. A comment below mentions West is playing 4D Chess and as much as I despise that phrase for its political connotations, I can't think of a better phrase to describe what the Logo is doing. Here's what basically happened this summer: Pleased with himself for getting some nice pieces back for CP3, West gets to work making sure the same thing doesn't happen with Blake. West sells Blake on re-signing (again, so he doesn't lose him for nothing) amidst talk about Clipper legacy and building around him while being well aware that if the right deal were to come along, he would be trade bait for picks, pieces, and offloading of valuable cap space FOR THE SUMMER OF 2018 (I'll get back to this later)  Bear in mind, this is a man who is only concerned with championships. Moral victories and playoff runs have no place in the history books. He cares about his legacy and to be brutally frank-if not a little morbid-he doesn't have long on this earth left so it's time to make moves. This isn't Heinke level tanking though. If you look at his teams, historically, West has never spent more than one season to re-build.   So he goes full Frank Underwood and gets adequate to maximum ROI for the players he knew he wasn't going to win championships with anyway instead of getting nothing in return for them, which was a frighteningly likely scenario before he came along. If anyone disagrees that he could have built a championship with Blake or CP3, I can't argue with that right now as it may still be possible. However, I would point to the fact that there's probably never been a better judge of basketball talent in NBA history than Jerry H. West. This is the man who drafted Nick Van Exel with the 37th pick, drafted Eddie Jones the next year in the lottery, traded fan favorite Vlade Divacs for the 13th pick so he could take a high school player named Kobe, had the balls to trade fan fave Monta Ellis and break up the ""We Believe"" Dubs before picking up Klay and Draymond (35th pick) in subsequent years, and then got on the phone with Durant to say something that resonated in a way that no other GM could emulate and ultimately convince him to join what was already one of the best teams in history. The list of stuff like this goes on forever. He is a basketball nostradamus and the GOAT at building championship-caliber teams. I may be wrong and Blake and CP3 may win a chip at some point along the line with the right teammates but for now, I believe West has proven himself more than enough times for people not to question what he's doing, especially when it looks like he's executing a well thought out plan to near perfection.   Now how will all this turn into a championship for the worst franchise in sports (not just basketball) history? We return once again to the subject of the Summer of 2018. The obvious big name is LeBron James but let's be real here: LeBron has privately stated he will never play for the Clippers (can't really blame him) and I'm not sure what incentive he has to play for them. If he were to come to LA, he'd be better off joining the Lakers in terms of his legacy and marketability. I'm not counting him out because West convinced Shaq and Durant to join his teams but it just seems unlikely. The far more likely scenario is a guy who has publicly stated that the Clippers were his favorite team growing up: Paul George, a bonafide superstar in the right situation. You take George and a couple other re-building projects that only West seems to know are worth investing in (i.e., Shaun Livingston) like Jabari Parker, Isaiah Thomas, Zach Lavine, or Demarcus Cousins, and you may have a squad that can win a chip. I believe this is in fact the most likely and fairly reasonable scenario. There's still the possibility that he entices the likes of Durant or Lebron simply because he's Jerry West. For a guy who's accomplished everything as an NBA executive, this is probably what drives him. Pulling off the impossible: making the Clippers legitimate not only to firmly establish his legacy as the greatest exec but also so he can hand over the keys to his son in a situation that will help him be successful as well.   TL;DR: Don't panic. Be excited! West is a genius. This is all part of the proce... short-term plan to re-build. Blake's trainers know his knees are basically done. In West we trust. "
"Yeah su- ""[WOJ] LEBRON JAMES REQUESTED A TRADE IN A MEETING WITH DAN GILBERT THIS WEEK"""
"And that's going to beat the Warriors how? OKC as currently constructed have a better shot at toppling the Warriors then whatever team you can make with the Lakers.   If LeBron James decides to join the Lakers then he doesn't care about winning championships anymore, simple as that. I don't believe he's ready to give up on that yet, which is why I'm a huge believer that he's going to the Rockets. "
"It's clearly a divided locker room. By culture guy, I meant someone that LeBron James can play with. There are some rumors of them getting RJ back too. At this point, the Cavs need to just coast into a top 4 seed for the East. RJ and Frye don't need to dress in the playoffs."
"I think we can agree on one thing: ""Fuck Lebron James"""
2019 Clippers:  Lou Williams - Austin Rivers - Wallace or Teodosic Avery Bradley - Patrick Beverley - Sindarius Thornwell Paul George - Tobias Harris - Sam Dekker LeBron James - Danillo Gallinari - Montrezl Harrell DeAndre Jordan - Boban Marjonovic  That’s a good fucking team.

Why? Did Lebron James retire?
The Cavs trade Lebron James!
"My dude was a beast. Probably not even the prime example of his game but just go watch Mavs- Heat 2011 finals and how he alone beat Wade James and Bosh ( Wade was a top 3 player, LeBron arguably the best player, and Bosh top 10) "
"Take last years Celtics and add Lebron James, Kevin Love, and Dwayne Wade. You would expect that team to win not 1, not 2, not 3 ..."
"I know people might think this is a troll post, one of those hyperbole media news shit, also Skip Bayless is there, but if anyone knows the history of Shannon Sharpe, they know he's the realest dude on television, and unlike others, he's a retired professional athlete himself with 3 Super Bowl rings.   &gt;  Also, for all the people who don't know, Shannon Sharpe and LeBron James are extremely close, they go way back. These two talk IRL behind the camera every day, and i know there's a 98% chance of these shit just being nothing but trolls, but since it's Shannon Sharpe confidently saying this, it means Lebron assured him of what's going to happen.   &gt;   I'm just saying, ya'll might be right and it could be nothing, but don't be surprised when something BIG actually happens in Cleveland, soon.     &gt;   **Edit**: LOL people really think i'm trolling and Shannon ain't in the LeBron's inner circle. It's hilarious how much kids on r/nba think they know. Anyways, don't act surprised later on, that's all i'm gon say. Cheers"
Isn't half of the Cleveland economy based on Lebron James? 
"&gt;LeBron James and the Cavs again turns on the switch and rapes the Eastern Conference in the playoffs, once again    Delusional and GOAT LeBron haters: *""Ehh, that was an easy playoff schedule""*  &gt;  **LOL FFS**"
"Yeah other coaches, like LeBron James, recognize the value of pure shooters as well."
"Will do right after you send the clip of lebron asking for dray to be suspended.  &gt; ""I don't know what should happen. It's not my call. That's the league office. They'll take a look at it,"" James said. ""We all saw it in the locker room.”  What lebron said, everything else is wild conspiracy theories that he ‘begged silver to suspend dray’ like you insane warriors fans like to believe. As if it even happened or as if punching nuts isn’t a flagrant no matter if you’re baited or not."
"Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, OG Anunoby, LeBron James, Serge Ibaka"
Lebron and four James Jones
"People knew he was one of the best shooters since day 1.  No one really makes GOAT predictions in someone's rookie year unless that rookie is Lebron James so I don't think that's fair to say.  His accolades have been mainly due to staying healthy on top of proper utilization/coaching, I wouldn't say it's as much to do with skill improvement."
"because if you look at the roster construction it requires Giannis to become Lebron James level to even sniff the finals atm, it's just not good. Bledsoe isn't a star level talent, just a good player. look at the young teams in the East that you guys will be up against in the future.   I mean unless you think jabari comes back with a force of a superstar and isn't traded in a few years because you don't wanna sign an injury prone dude to a max."
&gt;Id be all in for a paul george or a lebron james.  Giannis is 23. 
"James Harden, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Trevor Ariza, Clint Capela"
"Of course you have to account for age. LeBron James went from an infant who couldn't dribble to one of the best all time.... Kobe had hype and he had potential, obviously he seized every ounce of that potential if not more... but it was there the whole time."
the lakers are much in play for lebron james jr?
I don’t get teams like new orleans and bucks. You have literally a top 3 talent player and your wasting his years not trying to maximize their opportunities. Id gut the whole team to put legit talent around those 2.  Id be all in for a paul george or a lebron james. 
me:  1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Kyle Kuzma  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. Kristaps Porzingis  5. James Harden  6. Devin Booker  7. Anthony Davis  8. Kevin Durant  9. Joel Embiid  10. Stephen Curry  11. Kawhi Leonard  12. Ben Simmons  13. Robert Covington  14. Andrew Wiggins  15. Karl-Anthony Towns  16. Bradley Beal  17. Damian Lillard  18. Kyrie Irving   19. John Wolf  20. Steven Adams  21.

Bleacher Report publishes article “Isaiah Thomas Benched for 4th Quarter to Keep Separate from Lebron James” to keep separate from legitimate news sources 
&gt;in an effort to stagger his minutes with those of LeBron James
"Gary Payton   Michael Jordan Scottie Pippen LeBron James Hakeem Olajuwon  That team could defend any combination of players at an elite level, and you only need so many scorers. Air Jordan and Olajuwon are enough, with some good options on the rest of the team. No, I don't think I'm overrating Pippen."
"A team comprised of LeBron James, Kevin Love, Isaiah thomas coming off a 28 ppg season, Derrick rose, and Dwayne Wade are not even close to the favorites in the NBA finals this year."
By your definition of MVP there’s only one man that fits.  #LEBRON JAMES
"Maybe because Russell Westbrook is leading in rebounds, assists and steals over LeBron James. LeBron is averaging 26.8 points per game over Westbrook 25.7 points per game which isn’t too far from each other. It seems as if Westbrook has the momentum to pass LeBron since Westbrook just passed LeBron in total points but that shouldn’t count since OKC played 2 more games than CLE this season so far. RW (1286) LJ (1285). "

You talking about Miami Heat legend LeBron James?
"&gt;  but mentally no, youre right he shrunk, he was scared to take shots and let Bosh and Wade both take more shots and be more aggressive    People forgets Bron took a Cleveland team to the Finals where the second best player on that team was Anderson Varejao. LeBron was fucking 22 years old at that time.   &gt;  He was always unreal, always there mentally and obviously physically he always was a genetical freak, but what happened in 2011 was super unexpected,  because LeBron James was a God before he joined the Heat, and he has been literally a God since then, so idk how in the middle, out of fucking nowhere, in 2011, THAT happens.    Dude looked like he drunk on the henny, no joke. People can make jokes all they want about 2011, but when you put everything in pieces and think logically, it doesn't even make sense.   &gt;  My cousin believes  LeBron threw the game away, he loves conspiracy theories, and he thinks Bron was involved in some heavy shit, like most super rich people usually gets involved in, and he had to throw the biggest game of the year away, to repay a debt or some shit.    &gt;   Anyways, it's funny. Whatever it is, 2011 doesn't make sense, it'll never make sense"
"No athleticism? You’ve clearly never watched basketball. LeBron James, probably the most notable name in basketball for awhile, is an athletic monster and built his career on it. Plus that’s what makes the game. Some use their shooting accuracy to win while others rely on stone cold athleticism. Fuck off"
"What the fuck does he think he's in? Thunderdome, where everything stays inside the dome so he can just do whatever he want without harming the fans? This is the second most retarded thing he did.   The first? Continuing the farce Lebron James started by taking his talents to the west coast, which is why the NBA is fucked ATM. "
Not really an explanation... he was just rocking a stache and wearing a doo rag sometimes. https://www.gq.com/story/lebron-james-new-teammate-mustache 
"1.	Lebron James 2.	Stephen Curry 3.	Kevin Durant 4.	James Harden 5.	Giannis Antetokounpo  6.	Anthony Davis 7.	Kawhi Leonard  I get it, Russ fills the stat sheet every night... But so do all of these guys. I'd understand putting him ahead of Kawhi because Kawhi has been out the whole year, so that puts him at 7th.  Westbrook fills the stat sheet just like the other guys, except he isn't nearly as efficient as any of them.  Russ also hasn't proven himself able to be a leader of a team. Even this year, Melo and PG joined him and before this recent win streak, the Thunder were hardly .500. Even then, if you actually look at who they have played over this win streak, it's all been straight trash teams! Last year he had a decent team and still the Thunder were only the 6th seed and didn't even make it out of the first round.  Look, I get it it! He scores lots of points, grabs lots of boards, and gets lots of assists. But he doesn't do it efficiently and he doesn't lead his team's to success. You put any of those other 7 guys in his same situations either this year or last and both years the Thunder would have a better record, and that's why Russ isn't a top 5 player."
Lebron “Deion Sanders” James
"It may be too much content for a single 30 for 30 but I think an interesting one would be interviewing coaches and execs for insight into having lebron James on your team. He's totally revolutionized the role of the player in the NBA and I feel like there would be some good stuff about influencing trades, FA decisions, etc "
People have been saying since the summer it was gonna be hard for him to come back from this injury and to gel in the cavs system/ with lebron.  Now that it hasn’t come together in a week people are losing their mind. Look how the heat played when lebron first joined. Look at how the cavs played when lebron first came back from Miami. There’s an adjustment period and on top of that IT still looks clearly hurt to me.  It’s not surprising at all this is happening. People need to chill but this sub does shit like this all the time. Anyone remember LeTato James when he was trying to adjust to playing with kyrie?  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2lcazv/why_is_lebron_playing_like_a_potato/
What the fuck were people expecting? He’s clearly still recovering and is physically hampered. Did people think he’d be in all star form weeks after coming back from this injury and learning a new system and how to play with lebron? It’s not easy at all. People want instant gratification and it could take weeks or months to see how he really gels with the team.  Friggin lebron was getting called LeTato James when he first came back to the cavs when it took them a bit to get going. IT needing to get his feet wet is the least surprising thing ever. People need to chill.
"Yep agree with that.  He's gonna be amazing if he works hard and be smarter just like what LBJ did. IMO, he can be a LeBron james caliber offensive guy if he works really really really really hard like really hard and if not and take things half assed he could be a toned down Barkley. All best wish for this kid."
"""It was a business decision"" -Lebron ""Cam Newton"" James"
LEBRON JAMES!!! DEEP IN THE Q!!!!
Yeah I think if a team is going to put a rookie on LeBron James they have no chance..
Lebron James
"LeBron ""not a triple double"" James strikes again."
Everyone tried to tell people. It happens every year. The eastern conference is LeBron James' bitch. 
"LeBron ""ouch oof owie my head"" James."
" &gt;Yeah sure, I don't think that I was hostile in any way, I justed pointed out that what you are saying is ridiculous.   Great perception   &gt;I think it would work, both are capable playmakers and we've certainly seen backcourts with less combined playmaking ability do well. I mean just think of Curry/Thompson, those two seem to be doing just fine and Thompson is nowhere the passer that Harden or Kyrie is while Steph is on a similar level in that regard.  Thompson is way more than a scorer/passer, but okay    &gt;  &gt;Similar to you, when you started a discussion on whether you can say that one player is superior to the other under my comment about how players are remembered as time passes.  &gt;&gt;LeBron, WHICH I ACCIDENTALLY PUT INSTEAD OF KYRIE &gt; &gt;So you meant to put Kyrie twice? Right now it reads ""Rodman would not be able to slot into any team into the NBA and automatically make them better. Same thing with Kyrie and LeBron"". I don't really buy that you wanted it to say ""Same thing with Kyrie and Kyrie"".   I meant to say CP3 and Kyrie. It's not that hard to figure out that I DIDN'T mean LeBron or Kyrie twice   &gt;  &gt;What about Westbrook? He averaged a 30 point triple double, does he not add just as many, if not even more, points/rebounds/assists?  How many shots does he take, how many times does he pass to the right man and not force a ball  If you think assists are the defining factor of a a good passer, you're doing yourself a disservice    &gt; &gt;Are you really serious about that last bit? James Harden averages 9.1 assists this year and he is pretty much the best isolation scorer in the NBA. To me that doesn't seem like he focuses ""soley [sic] on shooting"".  Holy shit. Focusing more on shooting doesn't mean he stops passing. You seriously think Harden is doing more passing as a Rocket with CP3 than without?    &gt;Well, that was when he played with LeBron. In Boston, Kyrie doesn't have LeBron setting him up and he and his team seem to be doing just fine.  But even in Cleavand, he scored off of ISO drives and shots all the time. He wasn't part of the offensive structure too much. LeBron ran the offense,  not Kyrie    &gt; &gt;Why? I'm fully confident in saying that Stephen Curry is a better player and a better point guard than MCW. That's just the way it is. By the way, MCW won rookie of the year in 2014, tells a lot about how much you know about the NBA that you don't even know who he is.  I'm not saying Curry vs MCW, I'm talking about Curry vs any NBA player. The comparison falls short for any player VS curry unless you are saying they're as good as passing/defense/rebounding    &gt; &gt;Here's an example: CP3 is a better defender than Kyrie. What happens, now that we discovered that basketball is about more than just scoring and passing? Seriously, you can bring in a lot more factors into a discussion like that and it's not that hard to get to a conclusion about who is better.  Yeah I know all the factors? I literally commented on why LeBron is LeBron.  It's not just assists and points. It's his defense, rebounds,  overall ball movement, etc?     &gt;I agree, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible to say who is better between the two. Let me make an analogy. You have a beat up and very old Volkswagen Beetle and you have a brand new BMW 3 series. The Beetle is certainly the better choice when you want to go mud racing, but that doesn't change that the BMW is the better overall car.  But that analogy isn't fair   You need to compare two equals   Are you saying that CP3 is the mud car and the BMW is Kyrie?  I feel it would be more fair to compare a $250,000 SUV that sits a whole family to a $250,000 BMW/Audi/Porsche "
"Neither CP3 or Harden have achieved fucking shit in their careers, they are perennial chokers. They choke harder than your favorite swallowing compilation   Kyrie is a fucking killer. LeBron James gave this dude the ball in the finals ""go do it"".   Curry is the best PG in the league, then Kyrie. And then everyone else."
"&gt;Honestly, you need to learn how to how have a conversation without being hostile and condescending   Yeah sure, I don't think that I was hostile in any way, I justed pointed out that what you are saying is ridiculous.  &gt;Kyrie and Harden would never work without a ball passing player like CP3  I think it would work, both are capable playmakers and we've certainly seen backcourts with less combined playmaking ability do well. I mean just think of Curry/Thompson, those two seem to be doing just fine and Thompson is nowhere the passer that Harden or Kyrie is while Steph is on a similar level in that regard.  &gt;CP3 wouldn't work on a team without scorers around him to make shots   Kyrie wouldn't either, no one can score 100 PPG.  &gt;You completely missed my point   Similar to you, when you started a discussion on whether you can say that one player is superior to the other under my comment about how players are remembered as time passes.  &gt;LeBron, WHICH I ACCIDENTALLY PUT INSTEAD OF KYRIE  So you meant to put Kyrie twice? Right now it reads ""Rodman would not be able to slot into any team into the NBA and automatically make them better. Same thing with Kyrie and LeBron"". I don't really buy that you wanted it to say ""Same thing with Kyrie and Kyrie"".  &gt;There's quite a few, but there is no player with the rebounds, points and assists LeBron adds in the modern era   What about Westbrook? He averaged a 30 point triple double, does he not add just as many, if not even more, points/rebounds/assists?  &gt;Now going back to CP3, he fits perfectly into Houston. He shares the ball, plays great ball defense, and allows Harden to focus soley on shooting   Are you really serious about that last bit? James Harden averages 9.1 assists this year and he is pretty much the best isolation scorer in the NBA. To me that doesn't seem like he focuses ""soley [sic] on shooting"".  &gt;Kyrie works as the primary scorer. In the finals they won after being down 3-1, Kyrie was the PG, but the offense ran through LeBron and Kyrie's job wasn't to conduct the offense, but to put the ball in the net. Watch the highlights from that final. Kyrie scored off of ISO shots, drives, or LeBron finding him with a wide open shot  Well, that was when he played with LeBron. In Boston, Kyrie doesn't have LeBron setting him up and he and his team seem to be doing just fine.  &gt;As for your Steph Curry compared to whoever, it only works if you're saying that they're as good as passing, or whatever as Curry is shooting and scoring   Why? I'm fully confident in saying that Stephen Curry is a better player and a better point guard than MCW. That's just the way it is. By the way, MCW won rookie of the year in 2014, tells a lot about how much you know about the NBA that you don't even know who he is.  &gt;CP3 is as good of a passer as Kyrie is a scorer So who's better?   Here's an example: CP3 is a better defender than Kyrie. What happens, now that we discovered that basketball is about more than just scoring and passing? Seriously, you can bring in a lot more factors into a discussion like that and it's not that hard to get to a conclusion about who is better.  &gt;They're better in different scenarios for different teams   I agree, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible to say who is better between the two. Let me make an analogy. You have a beat up and very old Volkswagen Beetle and you have a brand new BMW 3 series. The Beetle is certainly the better choice when you want to go mud racing, but that doesn't change that the BMW is the better overall car."

"Danny Granger was a better leader for the Pacers than Paul George ever was.  James Jones was a nothing player, but referred to as one of the main leaders of the team.  Derek Fisher was not shit compared to Kobe, but they were both leaders for the team.   Lebron James was not the leader of the Miami Heat in 2011, it was Wade, and it showed. He took over that role in 2012, but he was deferring to Wade in that leadership spot and it actually did show in his play as we saw in the finals. That doesn't mean Wade was a better player than Lebron, he just wasn't the leader of someone else's team out of the gates when he joined that team. Difference is KD has no interest at ever taking over that role.  And when Durant came over it was Curry, not Durant, that was playing second fiddle. It was even a talked about discussion since Curry was playing poorly to start off the year last year and even spent much of the season shooting under 40% from 3(which is just absurd for a guy that has never shot under 41% over a whole season).   In the finals Durant was the first option, not the second. If we're talking about actions then you're lying about what you saw last year because it definitely was not Durant taking a back seat to Curry, it was vice versa, until Curry went back to being himself and that still have KD stepping back as much Curry just looking for his shot more again."
Imagine not having Chris Paul and James Harden and thinking LeBron is coming to your team next year.
"Here is a comment by /u/wjbc that details the illegal defense rule far better than I can (spoiler or TLDR: it’s not illegal defense anymore but was during Jordan’s era)   &gt; There are two illegal defense rules. The old one prohibited zone defense. The new one limits the ability of a zone defender to remain in the paint guarding no one.  &gt;For decades the NBA required teams to play man-to-man defense, which meant everyone on the court had to guard someone. You could double team one player and then recover to your man, but you could not be caught between players, guarding no one. That would be an illegal defense. That also meant you couldn't just stand in the paint all day guarding no one.  &gt;To take advantage of this rule, lousy teams with one great player like Michael Jordan would put MJ on one side of the floor and everyone else on the other side. This was the isolation play, or iso, for short. It would turn into a game of one-on-one which MJ would win. (This is before Jordan found some worthy teammates and Phil Jackson incorporated them into the offense with the triangle.)  &gt;Various tweaks to the rules tried to limit isos, but never eliminated them. When zone defenses became legal, though, it made isos much harder. The two man game, the pick and roll or pick and pop, has become much more popular than isos, simply because the defense can easily flood the side of the floor where the iso is taking place, forcing the star player to go one on three or pass the ball.  &gt;The NBA tried to give something to iso players when it eliminate the old illegal defense rule and made the zone legal. In order to prevent rim protectors from standing in the paint all day, when the NBA eliminated one kind of illegal defense they created another, the 3 second rule. A defender cannot stand in the paint guarding no one for 3 seconds or longer. Every 2.9 seconds he has to step out of the paint. That's the modern illegal defense rule.  &gt;However, despite the new illegal defense rule, legalizing the zone defense led to Tim Thibodeau's ICE strong-side overload defense, popularized when Thibodeau was the assistant coach in charge of defense during the Celtics' championship season in 2007-08. The zone had been legal for a while, but Thibodeau figured out how to flood the strong side of the floor, the side with the ball, with an extra defender, often forcing a long cross-court pass that would allow time for the defense to recover. The object of the defense was to force the ball out of the best player's hands.  &gt;Thibodeau dealt with the new illegal defense rule by training Kevin Garnett (and later Joakim Noah) to remain in the paint for 2.9 seconds, step out, then step back in. As long as he steps out every 2.9 seconds, he could be in the paint all day, guarding no one.  &gt;Thibodeau's ICE strong-side overload defense, or variations thereof, have been widely adopted in the NBA. The iso has fallen out of favor. The two man game is very popular, but passing to the other side of the floor must remain an option if the two men on the strong side find themselves outnumbered. One of LeBron James' remarkable abilities, for example, is making bullet passes all the way across the floor with precision to a spot up shooter standing at the three point line, so that the defense doesn't have time to recover. This is a vital skill under present rules."
Ben Simmons is the best rookie since Lebron James. Period. No arguing
"Terry ""LeBron James"" Rozier."
No but James Michael McAdoo won both a D League and NBA championship in the same year. LeBron is just playing catch up.
"Me too. Not that I don’t love watching history, but I could use a 1-year break from the LeBron James vs Warriors narrative."
I mean LeBron James is a great fit on literally every team in the league. 
Terry Rozier  Scary Terry  Terrifying Terrance  Terryfying Rozier  LeBron James 
"A funny moment for those who won't read the article:  The team had lost four of five games at that point, dropping its record to 9-8, and held a long, private meeting following the game. Riley revealed in the book that the day after the Heat's loss to Dallas, he asked James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to meet him in his office for 10 minutes to check on how the team leaders felt the young season was progressing.  ""They just said, 'We're not feeling it,' or something like that,"" Riley said. ""We talked about the typical things that we have to do, have patience and all of that stuff.  ""And I remember LeBron looking at me, and he said, 'Don't you ever get the itch?' I said, 'The itch for what?' He said, 'The itch to coach again?' I said, 'No, I don't have the itch.' He didn't ask any more questions, and I didn't offer any more answers. But I know what it meant, and I always go back and wonder about what he was thinking at that time. He walked out scratching his leg like it was itching.""    Fucking hilarious. I can't wait until all the HOF trash talk about LeBron comes out. Like all the Jordan, Pippen, Larry Bird, and Kobe behind the scenes trash talk that arose through the end of their careers and retirement. "
Stephen Curry  Kobe Bryant  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Dwight Howard  
"Did you read the article?  ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  He's talking all-time, historical greatness.  I don't think it has to be considered a slam on Mitchell, Believe me, as a diehard Mitchell fan I'd defend the shit outta that if I sensed any shade. I just think his comment is a byproduct of thinking big picture/long term/historical greatness. And good for him.  I honestly think anyone interpreting Ben as having any sort of beef with Mitchell is just looking for a fight."
"i'm not saying that, but what Lebron has done this year, without a single defensive scheme played by his squad all year long, it's pretty amazing carrying this team to 50 wins. Because he is called lbj, he must reach 1st seed and 60 wins? How u can do that with no Love for half year, an atrocious IT and garbage players paid by you who has decide to not compete in certain games. Also add a shit coach. Really, this Cavs would have met the Magic in a tanking race, if not for James. they really suck without him"
"Maybe, that Lebron James guy was solid when we played each other at the YMCA"
"**When the 6-foot-10 point guard was told the Rookie of the Year race appears to be a two-man show, he buried his head down and proceeded to chuckle. Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words.  ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""**  Nobody asked him what other rookies he likes or thinks are good.  They asked him which rookies ""caught his attention"" and he responded saying none because he follows the greats, since that's where he wants to be someday.  That's a perfectly acceptable answer and isn't dogging DM or any other rookies.  Ppl will play that narrative, but it's a stretch. "
"LeBron James  also, how the fuck you gonna guard 2 steph curry’s? "
"i remember grant talking about how his kids were in awe of lebron james but they had no idea that their dad was ""lebron"" before lebron.  what could've been with the Hill / TMac duo without injuries..."
"Lebron ""this entire damn franchise"" James"
Can we stop using the term “James” when we refer to either of them? LOL they literally have the same name. Just say LeBron or Harden.
"Sorry, should've clarified in the Finals. Which Finals opponent do you think MJ faced that was worse than the 2011 Mavs?  Or should I clarify further: MJ never had such a terrible Finals series as LeBron had against the 2011 Mavs. The Heat lost that series because of LeBron James, that's not even in dispute."
Everyone also forgets he has the most minutes played of any player over 30 besides LeBron James.
"&gt; In street clothes, his build is surprisingly dense; if Doncic had been born in Birmingham, Alabama, instead of Ljubljana, Slovenia, he might've played football.  Didn't know this about him. If true, he might be more ready than people think he is.  &gt; LA is amazing for me. I especially like the amazing cars  Awwww sheeet Luka the Laker...   In 2030 lol  &gt; Doncic was born in Ljubljana, where his father, Sasa, played for a top basketball club. As a young boy, he used to mop the floor at Sasa's games, occasionally taking shots during timeouts. His parents split up when Doncic was 8 years old, and from then on, Mirjam, a former model who opened a beauty shop, was his primary caretaker. Today, Sasa coaches a club in Slovenia. When asked to elaborate on their relationship, Luka declines.  Literally the white LeBron James  &gt; For Mirjam, the decision to send him away was agonizing. ""I said, 'Maybe you can wait a little bit,'"" she says. ""He said, 'Mom, I wanna go.'"" On her first flight back to Slovenia without him, she wept so violently that the flight attendants had to comfort her.  Awww :("
"""LeBron James DEEP in the..."" *tries to remember what arena he's in* ""...Staples Center!"""
"How is this getting upvotes? Lol Austin Carr is one of the most biased, homer announcers in the league. If you're a fan of Lebron and the Cavs I can see why you would like them but I've watched a few Cavs games and an opposing player could do a 360 off the backboard reverse dunk and they will act as if nothing happened or that it was a normal shot, then Lebron gets an open layup on the next possession and they're like ""OH LEBRON JAMES FROM THE Q! THE KING OF AKRON STRIKES AGAIN!""  Again, if you're rooting for the Cavs and Lebron they are amazing since they get pumped up like crazy and have some good hype quotes during Cavs highlights. But objectively they are not good announcers."
" &gt;fun to watch    LOL i get this from the delusional underage Rocket fans, but a Spurs fan? You are talking like a kid who doesn't even watch him, other than some highlights on Youtube. Harden is talented, and is fun to watch like 30-40% of the time, but majority of his play style depends on the Refs, LITERALLY.. That's boring as fuck, and quite disgusting.  It's disrespectful to the game, and it's definitely a mockery to whoever defends him. Locking arms with yours intentionally, just to get a foul, and the refs actually calling it, idk who's more of a scum, harden or the refs, but either ways, it's pure trash  &gt;   LeBron gets hammered every time he drives, but often gets no foul calls, refs give him the ""Shaq treatment"". Even Durant, AD or Curry don't get much foul calls on their favor, instead they get sent off. But someone farts around Harden, they send his bum ass to the line. That's hilarious   &gt;   And no, Harden won't score like that without the free throws, especially won't lead the league in scoring, LeBron or Durant would.  Constant trash free throws like he gets, it totally slows the game down, allows him to rest a bit, and also gets his defender in horrible foul trouble, for no reason. That's brilliant on his part, because he's abusing the blind ass refs and the system, but it's also extremely scummy.    &gt;   James Harden, when he doesn't get everything from the refs, is basically Playoff James Harden. That's why he's trash in the post season ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ "

"2018 NBA mock draft - Teams for Deandre Ayton, Luka Doncic, Marvin Bagley and Trae Young  by Jonathan Givony on 2018-04-26 23:06:00 UTC (original: http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/23084216/2018-nba-mock-draft-teams-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic-marvin-bagley-trae-young)  Which teams will land the best prospects in the 2018 NBA draft?  Let's look at where the top players -- including Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Deandre Ayton, Mohamed Bamba, Jaren Jackson Jr, and Marvin Bagley III -- might end up.  Our mock draft differs in two crucial ways from our recently updated top 100 prospect rankings. It uses ESPN's BPI to project the draft order, and it's adjusted for NBA team needs accordingly. It also attempts to project which players will end up declaring and keeping their names in the draft.  Track who's in and who's testing the waters in the 2018 draft here.  1 Phoenix Suns  Deandre Ayton Arizona Age: 19.7 C  Height: 7-foot | Weight: 243  Ayton was beginning to answer some of the questions scouts have had about him since high school with a string of dominant performances down the stretch before he finished the season on a poor note in an early NCAA tournament exit. Physically, he's one of the most gifted prospects we've seen in the draft in the past few years, and he has impressive skill level to boot.  Phoenix, the worst defensive team in the NBA, will be right to question Ayton's impact on that end of the floor, but his sheer productivity and overall talent level make it difficult to not slot him at the top of this class.  Starting salary: $8,095,680  2 Memphis Grizzlies  Luka Doncic Real Madrid Age: 19.1 PG  Height: 6-foot-8 | Weight: 228  Doncic hit a wall in early March after playing 17 straight months without a break for Real Madrid and the Slovenian national team. A two-and-a-half-week break might help rejuvenate him as Real Madrid approaches the final three months of the season and Doncic attempts to re-establish his candidacy as the potential No. 1 pick in the draft.  Considering their aging core, financial woes and precarious ownership situation, the Grizzlies will likely be looking to return to playoff contention as quickly as possible. Doncic would be a dream selection for the Grizzlies because he has the size, skill and versatility to fit in well alongside all their existing talent while possessing star potential in his own right.  Starting salary: $7,243,440  3 Atlanta Hawks  Jaren Jackson Jr. Michigan State Age: 18.5 PF/C  Height: 6-foot-11 | Weight: 240  The Hawks will be in best-player-available mode, but it helps to be able to complement their existing roster with a building block that fits with the surrounding talent. Jackson would be the ideal big man to pair with promising rookie John Collins.  The youngest projected first-rounder, Jackson might have the highest ceiling in terms of his ability to affect the game on both ends of the floor. He has enviable physical tools, including a 7-foot-4 wingspan and tremendous mobility. Jackson's ability to space the floor (40 percent from 3 and 80 percent from the line), block shots (5.7 per 40 minutes), switch on every screen and, increasingly, put the ball on the floor from the perimeter makes him an ideal fit for the modern NBA.  Starting salary: $6,504,600  4 Orlando Magic  Marvin Bagley III Duke Age: 19.0 PF/C  Height: 6-foot-11 | Weight: 234  Although there are some positional concerns regarding Bagley and his fit in the modern NBA, at some point, his talent and sheer production are likely too great to pass on.  Although the Magic could very well be in the market for a point guard, there are questions about whether any guard is worthy of being picked this high. Bagley is likely best suited for the center spot, and his scoring instincts, rebounding prowess and athleticism would make for an interesting fit alongside Aaron Gordon and Jonathan Isaac.  Starting salary: $5,864,640  5 Dallas Mavericks  Mohamed Bamba Texas Age: 19.9 C  Height: 7-foot | Weight: 207  With Nerlens Noel unlikely to be in Dallas' long-term plans and Dirk Nowitzki turning 40 in June, the Mavs will definitely be looking for a frontcourt player to build around.  Bamba's rare combination of length, shot-blocking instincts and offensive promise gives him one of highest ceilings of any prospect in this draft. Every team in the NBA is looking for a big man who can anchor a defense.  Starting salary: $5,310,720  6 Sacramento Kings  Wendell Carter Jr. Duke Age: 18.9 C  Height: 6-foot-10 | Weight: 259  None of the Kings' big men has emerged as a franchise cornerstone at this stage, meaning it would be foolish to pass on a top-tier talent due to positional concerns.  Carter's basketball IQ and versatility are promising in a number of ways. He is a physically mature big man with a 259-pound frame and a 7-foot-3 wingspan, which will allow him to play the center position in the NBA with ease.  He is a polished player with excellent hands and touch around the basket, and he has demonstrated a nice blend of passing, shot-blocking and perimeter shooting, despite being overshadowed at times by fellow big man Marvin Bagley III.  Starting salary: $4,823,520  7 Chicago Bulls  Trae Young Oklahoma Age: 19.5 PG  Height: 6-foot-2 | Weight: 176  Kris Dunn has had a breakout season for the Bulls, but he could certainly use some backcourt help due to his inconsistent jump shot and shaky decision-making.  Young looks like a nice backcourt pairing, with his ability to navigate pick-and-rolls, make shots off the dribble and find the open man with impressive creativity. Having the luxury of hiding him defensively will be a key to his early success, and Dunn can defend either guard spot.  Starting salary: $4,403,280  8 Cleveland Cavaliers (via Nets)  Michael Porter Jr. Missouri Age: 19.7 SF/PF  Height: 6-foot-10 | Weight: 214  With an uncertain future on the horizon due to LeBron James' free agency, the Cavs will need to stockpile as much talent as they can, regardless of their hopes of keeping the King at home.  Porter came into the season with hope of making a run at being the No. 1 pick in the draft. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to build his case because of a back injury. Porter's size, shot-creation skill and scoring instincts will nevertheless make him a coveted prospect next June. He is a playmaker on both ends of the floor and is just starting to figure out how to put his talent to full use.  Starting salary: $4,033,800  Cleveland will receive Brooklyn's first-round pick unprotected.  9 New York Knicks  Collin Sexton Alabama Age: 19.2 PG  Height: 6-foot-2 | Weight: 183  Frank Ntilikina has had some nice rookie moments, but the Knicks are finding out that the long-armed, 6-foot-5 guard seems better suited playing alongside a more dominant ball handler and shot creator who can take some of the scoring responsibilities off his shoulders.  Enter Sexton, with his tremendous aggressiveness driving the lane, taking off-the-dribble jumpers and putting defensive pressure on opposing guards. NBA teams have some concerns about Sexton's decision-making and reckless style of play. Fiercely competitive, Sexton has shown enough flashes in the right areas to be comfortably projected as a starting-caliber point guard with plenty of upside to grow into.  Starting salary: $3,708,120  10 Philadelphia 76ers (via Lakers)  Mikal Bridges Villanova Age: 21.6 SF  Height: 6-foot-7 | Weight: 200  The 76ers have gotten great production out of J.J. Redick and Marco Belinelli, but with both players approaching free agency and their mid-30s, it makes sense to think about drafting a wing who can complement the building blocks of Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz.  Bridges is an easy player to slot on almost any NBA roster, thanks to his multipositional defensive versatility, 3-point shooting and role player potential. He isn't as gifted a shot creator as you'd like from a top-10 pick, but on this roster, he won't need to be.  Starting salary: $3,522,480  Philadelphia will receive the Lakers' pick if it lands at No. 1 or Nos. 6-30. Otherwise, the pick goes to Boston."
"Technically James Harden is the only current all star on his team.   And when did sympathy become a factor in MVP? Why does LeBron “having” shitty players on his team propel him to MVP? Should harden be punished because he has good players on his team?  And I swear every offseason people rag on the rockets players and claim every other contender he’s a better roster. Yet, here comes harden being the playmaker he is making everyone look better and all these other supposed “good rosters” turn out to be shit and the narrative switches to Harden having excellent teammates.  The “Best Player In The World” is currently sitting at the 4th seed in a weaker conference while Harden is averaging 3 more points than him, 1 less assists, and 2 less rebounds. Not to mention he led his team to the #1 seed in the superior conference and the best record in the NBA.  You can make an argument why he should be considered, and rightfully so as LeBron James is arguably the GOAT. But sorry no, as amazing as LeBron is James Harden is the MVP and earns that award in every which way.  People who think LeBron should be MVP are just blinded by their hatred for Harden."
"""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch."""

Lebron better show Shannon love back considering how much Shannon loves Lebron. Think Shannon even posted on IG a while back of a Lebron James blanket over his bed. 
"You expressed the situation pretty well. LBJ's impact on Cavs ""Kyrieless"" is way more valuable than Harden's. It's tough to admit this year MVP is Lebron, bc Rockets team was so good all year long. A right compromise might be giving COY and 6OY to Houston and 5^ MVP   to James.  However, nothing on Harden. If he won he would deserve it more than anyone else"

"You should've read the article *before* posting lol.    &gt;Harden isn't having an insane season, and it just feels like he should get it now, not that he did anything special.    Well let's show you how ignorant that statement is:   &gt;The 28-year-old guard is having one of the most efficient high-volume scoring seasons in NBA history, averaging 30.6 points with a 62 true shooting percentage and a 54.1 effective field goal percentage. Toss in his 8.7 assists per game and he enters the stratosphere of the greatest offensive seasons in history; Michael Jordan is the only other player to drop 30 and eight with true shooting greater than 60 percent.   &gt;Harden scores 1.22 points per isolation possession, which is the highest recorded by a player with a minimum of 100 logged possessions since Synergy Sports began tracking data in the 2004-05 season. No one has even come close to scoring on isolations with such success at such a high frequency. Of the 35 individual seasons a player logged at least 500 isolation possessions—which includes multiple seasons by LeBron James and Kobe Bryant—the average player besides Harden this year scored 0.95 points per possession. But Harden’s 1.22 is better than any team has scored in transition during the past four seasons, per Synergy. Harden has also scored more total isolation points (868) than any other team this season (the Cavaliers are next closest with 801). That doesn’t seem possible.   &gt;Harden has more makes (79) and takes (176) on step-back 3-pointers than any team in the NBA; the next closest teams are Portland (45 makes) and Denver (122 takes). No team is featuring those shots in its arsenal, while Harden is hitting them at a 44.9 percent clip.   &gt;He’s allowing less than 0.8 points per possession against isolations and post-ups, is snatching 4.9 defensive rebounds per game, and ranks in the top 25 for both deflections and loose balls recovered. Harden isn’t a defensive stopper, but he’s no longer a liability.    &gt;The Rockets are the best team in the NBA and have one of the top offenses in history and an elite defense. Harden is their best player, and he’s having one of the greatest scoring seasons in history. The MVP debate was fun over the course of the season, but it really was never close.   You don't have to average an inefficient triple double on shit shooting splits to have an ""insane season.""    &gt;I know that sounds dumb because he's obviously great...   It even sounded dumb to you but you kept going lol   &gt;... but I think Westbrooks MVP season is exactly what MVP is all about. Narrative, historical season, game winners and heart. This season just falls short of that.   You have to be a troll or just insanely naive. "

There are two more players putting up the same kind of season this year and that's Lebron James and Russel Westbrook. That's pretty damn impressive.

Mitchell has put up an incredible season, but Simmons's is absolutely historic and there's nothing you can do to handwave that. "
“Lebron James...deep in Q!”
he is nice to look at too yes homo.  But really what is his relationship to LeBron James?  They  always spark up good rapport liek they are best friends after games it seems and that gets me irrationally excited.
"Bruh. You do realize that prior to this season a 16/8/8 season has only been done 15 times. 5 were Oscar Robertson, 3 were Magic Johnson, 2 were Lebron, 2 Westbrook, 1 James Harden, 1 Michael Jordan, and 1 Wilt. The kid is in elite company. And only Big O put that up in his rookie season. "
"Even that’s out of context though  &gt;""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  He’s saying he’s not looking at other rookies; he’s looking at the best players in the league as his peers. Probably not worded in the most elegant way possible, but I love the mindset."
Lebron James usually ends up losing games/series where he is doing it all.
"No, since Magic. James is listed at 6'8"", Magic is listed at 6'9"", and Ben is listed at 6'10"". KD is in a weird box of his own, because he has shooting that none of those other guys have.   I think Giannis' better athleticism and ability to score by slashing is a better comparison to LeBron. Ben's incredible passing vision and creative flare with his game is a bit more reminiscent of Magic."
Not before you get through someone named LeBron James
"Perhaps true but the way RFA is set up, it's basically unprecedented for a star player to turn down the max offer and accept a QO.  I highly doubt even a disgruntled KAT, stuck in a rebuild, would accept a one-year, ~$10M qualifying offer rather than have max money from the Wolves for 3-4 additional years.    That's the time frame they would've needed.  It would've pissed off Towns to be in perpetual rebuild and trade for guys like Asik to get two more first rounders, but by the time Towns' 3-4 year matched max extension was up, they would have very good young pieces around him.  The mindset you are describing, while understandable, is eerily similar to what the Cavs did with young Lebron James and the Pelicans did with young Anthony Davis.  ""This guy is good, we don't want to piss him off, we want to be good so he'll want to re-sign with us.""  No!   He's basically stuck there for 8-9 years.  Don't make ""win-now"" moves right away.  Be patient so that you are a title contender when your star is in year 7-8-9, then maybe he'll re-sign.   "
The numbers dismiss them. And the situations. Embiid goes down and simmons promptly averages a triple double. Sixers look to be the 3 seed past LEBRON JAMES. The offensive numbers are similar but the defensive numbers are not even close. The effect isn't really comparable.
How important is Dwyane Wade to LeBron James' legacy?  What if LeBron had only won one championship instead of three?
Tbf one of those was the biggest game of their season and they stepped up and survived an onslaught from lebron james
"I'm positive that I've watched him as much as anyone around here.  I think he'll be a very good, maybe even great player.  But there's always risk with Euro players, and he's not Lebron James.  Ayton is going to slide right into this league comfortably."
"But like, you didn’t think “man that’s weird” and then look into it any further? Like you just thought “Oh yeah amare won ROTY over Lebron James. That doesn’t seem weird at all.”?"
"Windhorst: Though there has been some confusion as to how James' midseason break came about at the time, it has now become clear it was at the insistence of team doctors because he needed to recover from the injection. When he did, he played tremendously for the following six months.  http://www.businessinsider.com/why-lebron-james-took-the-break-2015-10"
"lol I honestly kinda think a solid amount of people just don't like James Harden as a basketball player. He's had two seasons where one could make the argument he deserved the MVP, and now in his best season some folks are looking for any excuse not to give it to him.   That being said, LeBron has been fucking insane this year and many are coming to the slow realization that he's getting the Michael Jordan treatment when it comes to the award, people just got bored voting for them, and maybe want to rectify that.  idk, to me he's still the MVP. But it is funny that some people latch on to stuff like AD's hot streak a month ago just so it doesn't go to Harden."
Bruh you actually thought Stoudemire won roty over Lebron James?
"Aziz Ansari is older than LeBron James.  I wanted to make this it's own shit post but it didn't seem basketball ball related enough. But that blows my mind. It goes to show you how basketball really warps our idea of what ""old"" means. Like decrepit grandpa Dirk Nowitzki is really only 39 years old. Zooey Deschanel is 7 months younger than him! Marco Rubio is 46! If a 39 year old man tried to run for public office we'd call him a baby!"
LEBRON JAMES! THROWS THA HAMMER DOWNNNN!!  Kyle Korver with a DEEP three....THE BOTTOM!!!
"Yeah, I saw that in the post, but I thought it was remarkably asinine. I mean, why not start a post that says ""Four time MVP LeBron James shoots free throws at a worse % than rookie Donovan Mitchell"" while OP is at it? "
"I mean Lebron has won more games, and he has been pretty clutch throughout the season. So I guess he has an argument, but I wouldn't vote for him. James Harden has had a top 2 season in the NBA on the best team in the NBA. If that's not MVP worthy, then what the hell is?"
"Excuses,lmao..In 2006 Lebron averaged 31/7/6 (22 years old), Wade 27/6/7(25 years old) ,Bosh 22/10/2 (22 years old),Howard 18/12(21 years old) , james johnson 25/4/4 (25 years old) and Carmelo 27/5/3 (22 years old)"
"I think it's most likely he stays with the Cavs and they spend some money to bring in another guy... BUT, my dick gets so hard thinking about a Ben Simmons / Lebron James fast break. "
"**All-NBA First Team**  * Guard: James Harden, Houston Rockets * Guard: Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers * Forward: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers * Forward: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors * Center: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans  The five players from my MVP ballot fit nicely here. Stephen Curry and Chris Paul could’ve gotten Lillard’s spot, but both played less than 60 games. Giannis Antetokounmpo missed out on a first team forward spot only because of the brilliance of James and Durant, while Joel Embiid wasn’t good enough this season to outdo Davis for the first team center spot.  **All-NBA Second Team**  * Guard: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors * Guard: Chris Paul, Houston Rockets * Forward: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks * Forward: LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs * Center: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  Curry, Paul, Antetokounmpo and Embiid were all obvious selections for the second team, leaving just one forward spot up for grabs. That went to Aldridge, who has been outstanding for San Antonio, keeping the Spurs in the playoff hunt despite only having Kawhi Leonard for nine games due to his bizarre, season-long quad issues.  **All-NBA Third Team**  * Guard: Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder * Guard: DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors * Forward: Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder * Forward: Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves * Center: Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  Westbrook is close to averaging another triple-double, while DeRozan has been the engine of a Raptors team that could win 60 games. George and Butler were the clear choices as third-team forwards, with the NBA thankfully changing Butler’s eligibility from guard only to guard/forward, alleviating a very difficult task of trying to find a sixth forward worth including.  The final spot came down to Karl-Anthony Towns or Gobert, the league’s best offensive and defensive centers, respectively. By the slimmest of margins, Gobert gets the nod.  **All-Defensive First Team**  * Guard: Jrue Holiday, New Orleans Pelicans * Guard: Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers * Forward: Al Horford, Boston Celtics * Forward: Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder * Center: Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  Gobert, the defensive player of the year, was an easy choice, and sliding Horford over to forward makes for two of those. Holiday and Oladipo make their teams massively better when they are on the court (Indiana is 7.3 points per 100 possessions better with Oladipo out there and New Orleans is a full nine points per 100 possessions better when Holiday plays). George gets the final spot — both because he’s a great defender and as a nod to Andre Roberson, who was on pace to be the league’s best defensive player before suffering a season-ending knee injury.  **All-Defensive Second Team**  * Guard: Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves * Guard: Dejounte Murray, San Antonio Spurs * Forward: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans * Forward: Robert Covington, Philadelphia 76ers * Center: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  Minnesota has struggled on defense all season long, but would be completely lost without Butler (they are 7.4 points per 100 better defensively with him on the court). Murray, on the other hand, made a real impact in his second season, and first as a starter. Covington is the prototypical “3-and-D” player, and Davis is simply a monster. Embiid was the automatic choice as the second-team center.  **All-Rookie First Team**  1. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers 2. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz 3. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics 4. Lauri Markkanen, Chicago Bulls 5. Kyle Kuzma, Los Angeles Lakers  Simmons, Mitchell and Tatum were automatics. Markkanen has exceeded just about everyone’s expectations in Chicago, looking like the foundational piece the team hoped he’d be. Kuzma has predictably cooled off after his hot start, but still has been a gem of a find as a late-first rounder.  **All-Rookie Second Team**  1. John Collins, Atlanta Hawks 2. Lonzo Ball, Los Angeles Lakers 3. Dennis Smith, Jr., Dallas Mavericks 4. Bogdan Bogdanovic, Sacramento Kings 5. Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat  Trying to fill out the all-rookie second team is always a challenge, but this year was easier than most thanks to a deep class. Collins has emerged as a long-term rotation piece in Atlanta. Ball — despite all of the noise surrounding him — has actually contributed to winning as a rookie point guard, which is hard to do. Smith had an encouraging year in Dallas, where he’s been given the reins as the future of the franchise. Bogdanovic has been Sacramento’s best player, while Adebayo has shown the supreme athletic tools that will likely make him Hassan Whiteside’s successor in the middle in Miami.  edit: formatting"
"**Most Valuable Player**  1. James Harden, Houston Rockets 2. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 3. Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans 4. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers 5. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors  Harden goes wire-to-wire in this race, and will be a fully deserving MVP after finishing as a runner-up twice in the past three years. There has been a late push from James and some voters that he should be the pick for what would be a fifth time.  James had his chance to take control of the race when Harden went down with a hamstring injury on Dec. 31. Instead, January wound up one of the worst months of his career, the Cavaliers subsequently imploded and eventually swapped out nearly half their roster at the trade deadline. That simply can’t be ignored, nor should it be considered a positive even though the Cavaliers are better for making the trades.  As for the rest of the ballot, Davis edges out Lillard for third because of his contributions at both ends. Fifth place could go in a few directions — including toward Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo — but Durant gets the nod for helping lead the Warriors to near 60 wins despite the team’s myriad injuries.  **Defensive Player of the Year**  1. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz 2. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers 3. Al Horford, Boston Celtics  Gobert has been the NBA’s best defensive player this season. The only debate is whether he’s played enough games to edge out the league’s second best defender, Embiid. But that was before Embiid’s recent orbital bone fracture, which knocked him out for the final few games of the regular season. The difference thus became negligible, paving the way for Gobert to win. Horford gets the nod in third for being the linchpin of Boston’s defense, the NBA’s best this season.  **Rookie of the Year**  1. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers 2. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz 3. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  One of the year’s most contentious races. Simmons and Mitchell look like future superstars, and both are deserving. But Simmons gets the nod for how he’s played down the stretch — including a triple-double in Friday’s thrilling victory over the Cavaliers — helping the 76ers to what should be the third seed in the East. Tatum gets third place due to his contributions in Boston.  **Sixth Man of the Year**  1. Lou Williams, Los Angeles Clippers 2. Eric Gordon, Houston Rockets 3. Fred Van Vleet, Toronto Raptors  Williams and Gordon are closer to starters than bench players, but since they qualify they are atop this list. Williams gets the nod for his brilliant play with the Clippers, who he helped stay in the West playoff race until a loss to Denver Saturday. Van Vleet gets third place for his role as the leader of Toronto’s brilliant second unit, the NBA’s best this season.  **Coach of the Year**  1. Brad Stevens, Boston Celtics 2. Quin Snyder, Utah Jazz 3. Dwane Casey, Toronto Raptors  This was, by a significant margin, the toughest race to figure out. There are eight legitimate candidates: Stevens, Snyder, Casey, Philadelphia’s Brett Brown, Indiana’s Nate McMillan, Portland’s Terry Stotts, San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich and Houston’s Mike D’Antoni. A case can be made for all of them.  Stevens gets it, though, for the way he’s helped the Celtics to 50-plus wins despite losing Gordon Hayward five minutes into the season, and Kyrie Irving after just 60 games. Snyder is second for turning a rookie (Mitchell) into the focal point of his offense who led the Jazz to a top-four playoff spot in the West, while Casey is third for guiding the Raptors from one style of play to another with largely the same personnel, an extremely difficult task.  **Most Improved Player**  1. Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers 2. Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons 3. Spencer Dinwiddie, Brooklyn Nets  Oladipo will almost certainly be the unanimous winner given that he went from being an awkward-fitting sidekick to Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City to an all-star in Indiana. Drummond gets second for his all-around improvement — including his stunning turnaround at the free throw line — while Dinwiddie is third after transforming from a fringe NBA player entering the season to a surefire rotation player in Brooklyn.

AC is just a bit too slurred with words and just all over the place for me. Also everything he says is some shit any pleb off the street would say if they were an announcer (“Cavs gotta play defense if their gonna win this game” or “If you’re gonna take that shot you have to make it” ). Overall though they aren’t bad. Thank god for Fred McLeod doing most of the talking or it would be one shitty telecast.   **LEBRON JAMES WITH THE SLAM AND NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE.**  I don’t mind this one. 
"Neither Stephen A nor Skip counts, as for Chris Broussard, that is one he got woefully wrong at the time but he was probably looking at LeBron James' meltdown in 2011 as the only reason for not picking the Heat. If at all the experts were picking OKC over the Heat, they all deserved to be fired on the basis of pure stupidity. The Heat had a better starting lineup, better players to throw on from the bench and were just more experienced. You shouldn't change narratives just to suit LeBron's case for GOAT."
He is the only player that outplayed Lebron James in the playoffs.. in the East
"Yeah Harden should win because of the wins. But there is a great case you can make for James.  Harden's team added CP3; Lebron's team lost Kyrie and have the same record as last year. Harden is equal with James in TS and 3pt %, better at FT% (but this is very controversial with the way Harden creates foul calls), while James has better FG% and has better VORP. You can also argue Lebron has been more consistent given he has played every night."
&gt;Now imagine if he can get Lebron or JR into gaming...  [https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/01/lebron\-james\-nintendo\-switch\-mario\-kart\-play\-video\-games\-nba\-cavaliers](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/01/lebron-james-nintendo-switch-mario-kart-play-video-games-nba-cavaliers)
"Harden has been just as good and more consistent. He's equal with James in efficiency while scoring a few more ppg and very near James with apg as well. He's beating LeBron out in PER, WS, WS/48, and BPM.  LeBron has been great as always but Harden has arguably had a better season, and then add in the fact that he's clinched home court and could win 67-68 games, whereas LeBron has the Cavs at the 4th seed and will barely win 50...no brainer."
Post Malone looks like Lebron James
"I was responding to the “never to be done again” statistic in regards to a triple double average. Lebron averaged one since February, but let’s be serious, if he wanted to average a triple double all season he fuckin could...  James Harden could not physically impose his will and talent remotely close to the level Lebron could. How was Houston before CP3 with just Harden? Lebron is the only player in the NBA that can go to any team and get them to the finals.   Call me old school but that sounds pretty fuckin valuable to me "
"&gt;  There was a lot of backlash towards Draymond in the conference finals and towards the league for not reprimanding him, in the finals they just conceded to the fans when they suspended him in Game 5.   we can go into *why* Dray was suspended sure, but that’s not my point. It sounds like you’re agreeing with me that his nut shot in isolation did not deserve to be a flagrant  &gt; This is what they always do. They just did it this year getting blown out in Golden State then blowing out the Warriors from most of Game 3 before collapsing late and then blowing out the Warriors completely in Game 4. They 'suddenly' start playing better like any playoff team does.  Like I said, if you’re going to keep denying that Bogut’s injury and the curry and Dray disqualifications had no impact on the series and the Cavs just suddenly were able to be competitive with the dubs, then you’re living in a fantasy world not back by any facts, and wasting my time  &gt; Everyone knows injuries were huge in both 2015 and 2016 finals. But the way Kyrie Irving and James played in the end to win that series was very convincing.   Again bs. The Warriors’ losses came mostly at the defensive end, losing out on Bogut and Dray. Of course Lebron and Kyrie are gonna play better when Festus Ezeli and Anderson Varejao are in the paint instead of Andrew Bogut and the DPOY.   Meanwhile, the Cavs’ losses in 2015 came at the offensive end. In fact, Delly and Tristan Thompson taking Irving and love’s minutes improved the Cavs’ defense quite a lot actually "

"&gt; LeBron cannot do what Kobe or mj did    Oh you poor fool. You will get away only on reddit saying this illiterate horse shit. In reality, it's the exact opposite. LeBron actually did and can do anything Jordan could, but a LOT MORE, in a far greater genetical freak body..  But i get the argument about Jordan, but Kobe? He doesn't even belong in the same conversation. Kobe was never good at any area of basketball than LeBron, and you can ask anyone in the world, nobody will say otherwise, except some bias Laker fans.   &gt;   LeBron will break Kareem's scoring record by the time he retires, and still will be Top 5 in Assists of all time. That's more points than Kareem and Jordan, and more assists than the GOAT point guard Magic Johnson. All that done by ONE man, LeBron James ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯    &gt;    LeBron's efficiency is a night and day difference compared to someone like Kobe. Kobe never even had a 50% from the field shooting season, ever in his career. Dude always played low IQ basketball, shooting over triple teams and shit. LeBron's whole career FG% is 51% LOL and that's a 15 fucking year sample  &gt;    LeBron never had a Shaq, or a Pippen, but he took a Cavs team of Anderson Varejao and Zydrunas Ilgauskas to the NBA FINALS, at age 22. He also beat a 73-9 win team coming back from 3-1 in the NBA finals, at age 32. When the fuck Jordan ever did anything like that? He always lost in the 1st or 2nd round until Pippen arrived. Bron never lost in a 1st round series ever in his career.   &gt;  Kobe is a Laker legend, but he doesn't even belong in the same stratosphere with the likes of Jordan and LeBron.  Kobe ain't even above Shaq in the All Time list. You remember Shaq? The man who carried Kobe to 3 championships and won 3 finals MVP.    &gt;    *Bottom Line** is, Jordan and ESPECIALLY Kobe, never did what LeBron James did. I won't say LeBron is the GOAT, but he is known as the greatest all around player to ever play the game. That's all.    &gt;   Stop being a blind hater. Jordan is Jordan, but mentioning Kobe of all people in the same sentence as LeBron, is like comparing Westbrook and Durant. It's not even close, and actually quite laughable. Grow the fuck up kid. Stop embarrassing yourself"

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Ben Mclemore.  The first question to ask: why?

That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years . So you never watched Shaqlemore in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Ben's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the  greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Ben Mclemore, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Ben in his prime wouldn't think that.

Uh.... snek?  Vince Carter?  Melo?  LEBRON JAMES??????
"This isn't technically basketball related, it's more football related, but since it centered around Lebron James, I think it counts:  At some point during the 12-13 season, someone argued with me that Lebron could retire from the NBA today, and join the NFL and he'd instantly be ""the best tight end by far"".  I argued that because he hadn't played football in so long, he'd really have no chance against the best of the best because he wouldn't know the subtlties and nuances of the game the way they would. He argued that Lebron was so phyiscally gifted that it didn't matter. I conceded that had Lebron focused on football instead of basketball, he definitely had the physical tools to be one the best players in the NFL. But this dude would not accept that.  Lebron could stop playing basketball, and he'd be the best at anything sport, today, if he wanted to. I get that Lebron is great and all, but I can't get over how ridiculous this argument was."
"your game is underrated af. against bron last match, you make the ball pass around like Spurs!! Brett's system has humiliated bron squad for an half and if not for experience, they would have closed that match earlier. Also Embiidless. Covington developed in a terrific 3&amp;D guy with all tools to play a Finals stage. Dario is a fuxking genius too. Love'em all,hope they will not dismantle no one of this group to take Lebron James or anyone else. TJ hoooold it"

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Yea Lebron was the best player on his team and in the middle of his prime. James was the third best player and came off the bench. The same thing does not apply because the situation is not the same. The loss to the mavs is on Lebron's shoulders. 
I don't understand this man. Completely inexplicable things about players I like  Paul George playing like prime Andrea bargniani for 1/4th of the season  James Harden being completely trash in a large amount of big games  Lowry and his post ASB wind down that apparently happens regardless of rest  LeBron James two times every five years where he completely gives up on a playoff game

"Ok guy.  &gt;  I’ve watched several Cavs game this season and from those games I know they are not a good basketball team  And I've watched about all of them, I think I have a better grasp on this team and their capabilities. I also like how you use hypothetical's to say the Pacers should've won already, but if I were to do the same for the Cavs I'd be wrong right? So if players like Korver and Love were hitting their shots, this series is over in 4, yeah? Then there's this:  &gt; Lebron makes up for their weaknesses and he alone is enough to compete with almost all the eastern conference teams.  So if Lebron is good enough to make the Cavs TEAM compete with the entire conference, how can you say:  &gt; Pacers are a better team without a doubt but Lebron is great.   because if Lebron is that great and can carry this Cavs TEAM to victory, then maybe that TEAM he is on might be considered the better TEAM overall. Definitely no teams in the east that are ""without a doubt"" better than the Cavs. The series standings say:         Cleveland Cavaliers 3 - Indiana Pacers 2 Note it says Cleveland Cavaliers, not Lebron James. You're arguing on semantics to try and prove a stupid point."

Would this be the same series that was decided by an absolutely inhumane block by one LeBron James on what should have been a go ahead layup by Andre Iguodala which led to a Kyrie Irving dagger 3 in Steph Curry's eye?

"What do they say about erections lasting longer then 4 hrs? In all honesty say he does want a super max and GSW can’t afford it much like Lebron James where does he go? You have three teams (Lakers, Knicks, and Sixers) If he is all about titles we bring him the best chance at rings right now. To your other point I hope Fultz gets his shot down this off season and we can play him in a SG/ secondary ball handler with the first squad he is too good to want to be a sixth man "
"what the fuck. Simmons literally wrote a whole article about how Lebron needs to sign with the 76ers to achieve GOAT status.

"I'm not sure anyone will try to emulate what Westbrook is doing in the regular season until he has more success in the playoffs.  Success breeds imitators, but success includes championships, not just regular season stats.    If Steph Curry hadn't won two championships people might be complaining that he shoots too much and should look to pass more.  If LeBron James hadn't won three championships people might still be complaining that he passes too much and should shoot more (that was a real complaint before his first championship).

"Only Michael Jordan and LeBron James are capable of winning playoff series by themselves.    T-Mac was wrong to call out Giannis for that, but T-Mac has absolutely taken over games.  It's unfortunate he didn't manage his team choices better and that's why you can blame him for not winning a playoff series.  Had he stayed in Orlando, he and Dwight would have been a force.   Unfortunately, he went to Houston where he and Yao could never stay healthy."
Were they playing with LeBron James before? 
"Nope didnt say that. But what actually happened is its used as a POSITIVE for his career, and regardless of circumstance lebron james is the only all time great player I cant think of who loses finals and his fans tell us its a positive for his legacy and greatness.

"The only reason he didn't get a vote is people who were choosing Warriors players colluded to keep it from James. Think I remember there being 7 voters and it was set up to be 3, 2, 2 Lebron/Curry/Iggy before they converged.   How they decided on going Iggy over Curry is beyond me though. Watching it was pretty clear their whole avenue to victory was cleared by Curry."
Can someone clarify how Lebron James and Simmons make sense on the same team?
"The fuck you mean ""passion for winning""?  Was Kawhi not passionate when he won 66 games the last time he was healthy, and took the fucking Spurs to one of their best ever seasons? How about when he won Finals MVP and did a solid job guarding LeBron fucking James in the midst of his prime?  You, like everyone else in the sub, on ESPN, or not named Kawhi and the Spurs don't know shit about what's going on, so don't act like Kawhi's character is at question here. Playing through an injury is reckless and is clearly not the best option for any young superstar to trade longevity and long term health for a playoff series.  P.S.: if you were following news on Kawhi at all, you'd realize that this an offshoot of a comment that's been posted several times in the last 24 hours about how he thinks practices shoot be for when he possibly returns from rehab, and has been spun by talking heads from ""Kawhi argues were the Spurs on practices"" to ""Kawhi Leonard has a list of demands before he returns to the team"", both of which are exacerbated bullshit in order to generate clicks.

"Haha except in the post you responded to where **I literally said that the out of bounds should have been called off Thad Young.** I might be salty, but at least I know how to read.   Also, I'm not even that salty about the fucking loss. I'm salty that the reffing sucked. LeBron James is the reason I watch pro ball. This is a literally the first time I've ever rooted against him in the playoffs. If he wins this series by averaging a 40-point triple-double, I won't be upset."

Right a regular dubs fan sticking up for Lebron James. 
Doesn't matter. Refs also got the call wrong when the ball was called out of bounds on James. Refs got em both wrong and there is nothing that will change that. Cavs won and LeBron made an all time clutch shit. Period. 
"That was a 100% fantastic shot, but does anybody have any stats showing that Lebron is now ""clutch""? [This](http://www.espn.com/blog/marc-stein/post/_/id/4396/clutch-shots-are-tough-just-ask-lebron-james) is the last article I could easily find and his stats aren't good.

Thon Maker played with John Naismith and will continue to play until LeBron James the Third.
I think this put the discussion to rest. From the NBA LTMR:  Q4 00:05.1 LATR shows that James (CLE) blocks Oladipo's (IND) shot attempt after it makes contact with the backboard.  INC Violation: Defensive Goaltending LeBron James Victor Oladipo
It's sad we got guys like Al Horford making the same money as guys like James Harden and LeBron. The max contract shit basically fucks over deep but not top heavy teams that have to pay fringe all stars the same as MVP players. 
Nah i would take this one Lebron James  is 32-9 all time in games where his team has a chance to win the series and has won 11 STRAIGHT!!!

"They had room for 2, but could get all 3 if they traded Deng.  Between Noah, Asik, Taj, Rose and James Johnson they had $13.23 million in salary.   Salary cap was $58.044 million. That gave them $44.814 million in cap space (less any roster penalties).  Wade/Bosh/Lebron all started at $14.5 million, or $43.5 million in total salary.   They might have been knocked down to something like $14.3 million or something like that because of the roster penalties, but it wasn’t anything significant and one of the rookies could be traded if the salary was that big of an issue.

James harden could have dragged the rockets to the finals the last two years if they were in the east instead of the cavs. He is a generational offensive talent. And no the sun's wouldn't stand a chance with LeBron. 
"You don't pick a GOAT, someone is universally recognized as the GOAT, doesn't matter you like it or not. It has been Jordan, now soon it might be LeBron. It's that fucking simple  FYI, it's not LeBron's fault that he's a genetical freak of nature with godly durability and insanely high BBIQ. I mean, if that's not GOAT, cool, then he's an Alien. Whatever you say. But LeBron is more talented all around than anyone in NBA history, especially with that physique and athletic freaky-ness.  Bron is already the only player is history to reach 30k career points, 8k career assists and 8k career rebounds. By the time he retires, he'll break Kareem's scoring record as a pass first guy, and be in Top 5 assists of all time as well. That's more points than pure scorers like Kareem, Jordan, Kobe and more assists than the GOAT point guard Magic Johnson. All that done by one man, LeBron James..¯\_(ツ)_/¯  So that's not GOAT? Why? Because people stuck in the past or y'all hate Bron too much? Or Less Rings? Because Jordan has 6 and Bron 3? GOAT is based on Rings? Then guess what, per y'all logic, 11 beats 6 easily, so Bill Russell is the GOAT. End of story, ya headass. Fuck outa here "
"Brian ""The Custodian"" Cardinal's effective field goal % was above 100% in the 2011 playoffs (112.5%), and more than double Lebron James' (50.7%), carrying Cardinal's Mavs to victory over Lebron James' Heat."
"MJ isn't even #2, that spot belongs to future Laker legend Lebron James.  And if it weren't for AIDS he'd be the #2 MJ."
"They were that year. So yes. Griffin was a top 3 mvp candidate...looking back it doesnt seem lile a thing, but Blake and Noah were ballin that year. Also. We live in a world where Lebron James cant be MVP over James Harden because of DEFENSE."
That's also another one. That game ended so many gasbags narratives. Also made a lot of people realize just how much we underappreciated Lebron James.
Lebron James says that Victor Oladipo shouldn’t have played like shit and lost a game that was 5 on 1
"Please make the case for Miami a being a better destination than Philly. Is it the Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Dion Waiters contracts that are going to lure LeBron? Or Hassan Whiteside and Dragic? One last run at it with Wade? Their complete lack of draft picks for the next 4 years?"

"&gt;No matter the era, Jordan and LeBron would be among the top players.  With Lebron James we know for sure he'd be able to scrap in the 90s. It's not anything totally foreign to him. He still tries to bulldoze in the paint. He'd just be running it more often.  But with Jordan, there's the hope that Jordan could increase his efficiency from 3pt but the truth is throughout his entire career he only shot .327 from 3. Now I don't know how much time he spent on that part of his game vs say a Curry, but throughout his entire career, he never improved. So going based off that and current NBA trends, there's no guarantee that if he was plugged in to today's game that he'd dominate.  "

"That's what I thought too.

"Pretty much everyone on the roster in every single season, by giving them lots and lots of free open looks?  Thus making them look a bit better than they actually are, because playing with LeBron means the defense has to bend to accommodate the fact that you are, yknow, *on the court with LeBron James?* And he's more than good enough a passer to make the defense pay for that, provided you actually can nail the open looks?  I get that the dumber sections of Laker fandom are still in the ""I have to tear James down because muh Kobe"" mindset, but even by those standards this is a dumbass post. It's not even *slightly* open to question. And Kobe's legacy is very safe. You can stop being stupid now."

Another user pointed out on the report it says Lebron traveled at 31.3 seconds that wasn't called...

"I mean, he is basically the Lithuanian Lebron James Jr "
"Did you just try to insult Lebron? LeBron James? The guy who makes everyone tremble in fear at night because he'll surpass their beloved Michael Jordan? That LeBron James? That one?  I’ve been involved in numerous statistical organizations, and I have over 300 hours logged in developing specialized integrated systems that track synergical players in a deep-web system. Lebron is the greatest passer in league history and it shows if you take a median derivation of his AST% and VORP, you'll notice he edges every single player that stands in his way, a metric that your 'Jordan"" struggles to touch. Lebron is the top passer and Jordan can't touch how he throws it behind the back, through the loop, through the hoop, and behind the neck.  Jordan is nothing to me but just another Nike magnet that they use to make money. Take away Nike, take away the Wheaties, and what do you get? A talented scorer is all that's left. Advertising conglomerates have turned him into some sort of mythical figure whereas if you look at the integrated passing deviation systems you'll notice that he can't have half the impact that LBJ has on a nightly basis, both on offense and defense (LeBron was snubbed of four DPOYs and counting).  LeBron would wipe him the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit about Lebron over the Internet? Think again. As we speak I am contacting Uninterrupted and Rich Paul's agency across the USA. You are able to receive a cease and desist from Klutch Sports and you're about to realize you should've enjoyed your house more because you also got a eviction notice coming sent to you by associates of Rich himself. You don't understand what makes LeBron great. You might be jealous of his photographic memory or his all-around ability.  Jordan and Kobe were never all-around players because they only cared about themselves. Show me an example of Jordan and Kobe praising a teammate, will you mate? Lebron and his teammates have an unmovable, unshakable, irresistable bond and this is the reason the chemistry between his teams is so amazing. His tantalizing body and 8% body fat make him the prime specimen, a juicy beast of a man who will eviscerate every player that stands in his way, powered by the unconditional love that he shows his teammates, all tying back to the his all-around, teammate first mentality.  People who hate on Lebron are just haters that they are fans of players that can't do anything but score. Lebron, however, elevates his teammates into star status. He turned Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love into superstars and that's just one example. You probably forgot how he whipped Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh into superstar form as well, leading to back to back championships with the Heat. That's what makes Lebron special. He can get his own, he just chooses no to. LeBron can score 70 or 80 on any given night and get the W but how is that going to make Kyrie better? It won't. LeBron knows what he is doing. That's why he's the muthafucking King.  He is the King. He is an all-around player. And he does it all with his teammates in mind. And that's why he'll always be my favorite player.  Don't ever try to talk shit about Lebron again, and learn to appreciate that we have the greatest basketball player not SCORER of all time. "
1) Kevin Durant  2) LeBron James  3) Steph Curry  4) Anthony Davis  5) James Harden  6) Jrue Holiday  7) Paul George  8) Damian Lillard  9) Jimmy Butler  10) Giannis Antkeomnqpoko
but Michael Phelps????  I'd have to argue and say Phelps is the greatest fucking athlete ever  1. Michael Phelps 2. LeBron James
"""In super slow motion, you just see the ball hit the glass, and maybe come off an inch and that's when LeBron got it. Like I said, once the ball touches the basketball, defenders cannot touch it and unfortunately James did."" -NBA Senior Vice President of Replay &amp; Referee Operations Joe Borgia...in that quote he meant ""ball touches the backboard"" it could be a typo or used wrong wording..it's pretty clear"
"You can say he was a better winner since he led the best team of all time and went 6-0 in the Finals (even matching the ring count people will argue Jordan was better/more dominant on a league level).  But he will ALWAYS be more clutch? Because Bron already has more playoff game-winners... It's an argument now IMO, it's not a case-closed nothin' Bron can do situation at ALL.  In the end, I feel like people Jordan/James debate will come down to whether you prefer Michael having dominating the league for most of his shorter career or LeBron having the best resume built over two decades."
Pacers.   They've shown they can win in Cleveland and were a fantastic Lebron James block and an equally fantastic Lebron James 3 pointer away from being up 3-2 themselves. Plus Lebron is going to be more fatigued as the series went on and has arguably the least amount of help relative to the other teams you mentioned.  Buck would be a close second but I have more faith in Brad Stevens than Ty Lue to make adjustments.
"NBA Senior Vice President of Replay &amp; Referee Operations Joe Borgia offered his take in an appearance on NBA TV on Wednesday night:  ""Our rule is once the ball touches the glass, a defender cannot touch it,"" Borgia said. ""... But in order to use replay, you must call goaltending on the court. And no call was made on the court, therefore they could not come over and look at it.  ""In super slow motion, you just see the ball hit the glass, and maybe come off an inch and that's when LeBron got it. Like I said, once the ball touches the basketball, defenders cannot touch it and unfortunately James did.""   WE KNOW"
The only Kobe/LeBron debate is Kobe Vs. LeBron James Jr.
"They would have put all 5 guys on James, had all of them surround him in a warm group bear hug.  James would still have shot it, and still have hit it.  He's LeBron James."
"I actually really like LeBron. He's my second favorite NBA player. I started watching the NBA when he went pro and I hope he wins a dozen more rings. I'm rooting for the Pacers this series because Vic is my favorite player and I live in Indy, but I won't be torn up if we lose. My first reaction to James hitting that 3 to win was ""oh my god i am witness.""  Having said that, the refs botched two game changing calls in the last minute of a tied playoff series. I don't care how fucking close the calls are, I expect them to make the right call. It's frustrating watching people tell Vic to just buck up. It was a shit call, and the refs should be called out for it."
"He should have. If they decided to go to the Bulls, they could have had the Bulls cap dump Luol Deng to fit all three in.  Could have had:  PG - Derrick Rose SG - Dwyane Wade SF - Lebron James PF - Chris Bosh C - Joakim Noah  And then they probably would have added Jimmy Butler to that as he was the 30th pick, assuming they didn’t trade that draft pick.  Legitimately could have been good enough to go 82-0. "
"Then their sons will dig up their Reddit post history and find out father was a LeBron hater and shitposter. Son will disown father for his web of lies and go on to be mentored by LeBron James and become the next LeBron James. Thus the father will have no choice but to continue the cycle of irrational hatred, but this time it will be against his own blood. "
"I'm not actually sure:   Offense|Defense ---|--- Ben Simmons| Jaylen Brown? JJ Redick| Kyrie Irving? Robert Covington| Gordon Hayward Dario Saric| Jason Tatum? Joel Embiid| Al Horford  Does this look right? I think Brown on Simmons might work? Not sure how he has done defending guards but he's pretty damn versatile. Simmons is one of the faster guards in the league though and would be a challenge.   How has tatum been defensively? Depending on the matchup Dario/Ben might be the problem makers for you guys.   But yea, not sure this is a mismatch everywhere type situation.   Edit: LOL forgot to put LeBron into the lineup. Celtics would be fucked.   Offense|Defense ---|--- Ben Simmons| Brown/Tatum? JJ Redick| Kyrie Irving? Robert Covington| Gordon Hayward Lebron James| Brown/Tatum? Joel Embiid| Al Horford  Yo i want lebron now "
"I'm sure he makes a lot of money by being a dick. He loves guys like Brady and Tebow, hates James and Suggs. And loves Kawhi and all Spurs. He apparently makes $5\-9mill/year doing his sports show. His family can thank LeBron for allowing him to generate so much revenue.  It would be kind of funny to see James sign with the Spurs and see SKEEEEUP cry."
"Same thing happens to anybody polarizing. If you're a star, the positive attention you gain will eventually be loud enough to draw loud negative attention too. Read any thread hating on Russell westbrook (""ballhog, statpadder""), james harden (""no defense, not a leader, choker, etc""), lebron (""not jordan lmao, bad leader blah blah""), Kevin Durant (""can't carry, fake, snake, etc""), it's all the same shit, and it's not at ALL new.  Kobe got all of the same hate as westbrook. Jordan got tons of hate for being a shit team mate. Shaq got tons of hate for ""low effort."" KG and Dirk and Paul Pierce and Allen Iverson and Tmac and many other guys got all kinds of criticism for being ""great but not a guy that can carry you over the finish line."" It's funny because every season that applies to somebody lmao. "
"1. The Lakers are the west. You were complaining about the East being trash today, aka saying LeBron's path to the Finals is easy. So was Jordan's by that logic.  2. Two Lakers starters got hurt in the Finals and missed the last game, including HOFer James Worthy  3. That was Magic's last year and Kareem had already retired. They barely made the playoffs the next year. It was the equivalent of the Spurs over the last year or two. Still really good, but not legendary like a few years before.  We can play this game all day. The point is, you can't just trash LeBron's path to championships because it's too easy and then ignore the factors that made Jordan's path easy at times. LeBron didn't get to avoid the 73 win Warriors.  The point is that LeBron and Jordan are two of the greatest athletes of all time and it's dumb to try to knock one down just to prop up the other. Both have beat incredible teams in the playoffs and had incredible individual performances. Discrediting LeBron's runs because they were ""easy"" is dumb. "
LeBron can be your James Worthy
"LeBron James will sign with Philadelphia in July, win a championship in 2019, and promptly retire as a 76er."
"Oh no, if only Lebron James could ever get a call to go his way. "
"I mean, without either he still won a title in Cleveland. I think you have it backwards - Miami's success with the Big 3 was more due to the help of Lebron James being a cheat code than a competent roster, coach, system or front office."
"[Just post the original source](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2018/05/30/houston-rockets-lebron-james-paul-george-free-agency-los-angeles-lakers/), instead of an Amico tweet, that links to an Amico article, that references a Rockets Wire article...."
"Except it was a one time cap spike, I’d love another cap spike this offseason so we could sign Lebron James"
2018 Lebron James
"My message for Kevin Durant is ""He will never be as good as Lebron James""!"
"Shoulda... Woulda...  Being the DPOY while averaging 30 points a game has nothing to do with narratives. Jordan came close to that award several times, while still being the top scorer in the league.  The fact that Lebron can defend 1-5 was probably true 8 years ago, but him having a bigger and stronger body doesn't mean that Jordan couldn't defend on centers or power forwards. The only defensive highlights you see from James now is blocks on smaller players."
Id read the fuck out of this book over a Lebron James basketball book honestly. It would be unique
LeBron James.
"Ohh. The old man complex.  Before I leave you here, I have watched MJ and though I agree MJ is better on some aspects, Lebron have the same advantage on other aspects. As much as it's painful for others to see, unlike in the 90s and 00s, Jordan is no longer the unanimous GOAT for everyone even for those who are in the league. I am not saying he is no longer  GOAT. I still think he is. To be fair though, I am pretty sure someone will dethrone James eventually as well in maybe 10, 20 years or so. That is how evolution works.  And one piece of advice, your argument about how Lebron was never part of a 70 team, that is the most stupid argument I have ever read. We are talking about GOAT here. Not greatest team of all time. Jordan retired and they are still a VERY STRONG team. And if we use your logic, Jordan has never led a 2007 Cavs team to the finals. When he had that level of team, he either gets bounced in the first round or the second round. Speaks more about their individuality which favors Lebron being the best individual player we have ever seen. So just please stop because it's stupid. Give me Pippen who embraced 2nd option, role players who stick with their roles, and Phil Jackson plus Lebron, I'd take Lebron any day."
LeBron James Harden  Chris Paul George   ????
That's a strange way to spell LeBron James
Find a new slant. Lebron James is buying the Cleveland Browns.
In no specific order off the top of my head:  Zach LaVine  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Jordan  Lebron James  Andrew Wiggins  Russell Westbrook  Paul George  Victor Oladipo  Giannis Antetokoumpo   Terrence Ferguson
Player coach LeBron James? I'd take it.  Offer him both positions. Bet he'd be all over that.
"I'm not discrediting his rings, I'm just saying that his 7 rings don't (for instance) carry the weight of, say, MJ's 6 rings. I don't know how this is even controversial - if what I'm saying wasn't true, people would be arguing Horry was a greater player than Jordan, which obviously they aren't. I'm just saying that when you get to a level like LeBron James has, adding a ring by being on a squad that could have won a chip without you is not a meaningful addition to your legacy. If LeBron actually joined the Warriors this offseason people would argue that he was great on the strength of the ring he got against the Warriors, not the ones he got with them. I don't think it discredits Horry to say that, it's just a statement of fact about the role he played vs. the role a guy like MJ or LeBron played."
"it doesnt matter what they think of Colangelo, Embiid and Fultz and the owners are gonna want him gone regardless.  This is the most important free agency cycle of the rebuild, we can't have this guy throwing his guys under the bus and revealing secrets about the organization.  This is a much bigger fuck up than you think imo.  If he stays i will be stunned and i will hate the fucking front office and joshua harris until the day i die because it is free agent suicide and the current players could want out and refuse to play for him.  It is waving the white flag in free agency and you are trying to get LEBRON FUCKING JAMES.  This is HUGE.  I do have this sinking feeling though that he could find a way to maintain his job SOMEHOW to the detriment to literally everyone involved in the organization.  Theyre like the god damned lannisters, they don't go away.  And Silver would probably have something to do with it because he basically placed him there in the first place.  Man, Sixers fans are gonna revolt if he keeps his job."
The Lebron james kid had me dead. [but this is the goat Bron hype video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzVM0Y9qdLs)
Fuck KD and Fuck LeBron James
"There was a thread today comparing James harden recent series vs the warriors,to 2015 lebron vs the warriors. Just stop it. This dude lebron is crazy."
"I think a ring is a ring. Dahntay Jones isn't LeBron James. Jones scored 5 points in that series, I'm not even gonna bother looking up what LeBron James scored, no one is arguing over who contributed more. But Dahntay still gets to slip that ring on same as LeBron and I'll bet it's just as heavy on his finger.   LeBron doesn't need any more rings for people to acknowledge he's one of the GOATs, that's already clear. He wants more rings because that's what he wants, how he goes about getting them is his business."
"Iguodala played the first 4 games fully healthy. We were 3-1 during that stretch. He went out game 5 with back spasms. Have you ever had back spasms before? They're the worst shit ever. Yeah Iguodala played game 6 and 7, but there were times were he literally couldn't run due to the pain and they had to sub him off. It was so obvious that even the commentators called him out on it and said ""I'd go right at Iguodala if I'm James. He can barely move out there"". Iguodala is our best LeBron defender. Once he got hurt, LeBron was able to do whatever he wanted.  Bogut averaged 15 minutes per game. Not a huge amount but enough to make an impact. Let's also remember he had 5 blocks in game 2 (2 against LeBron). He was one of the best interior defenders in the league. When Bogut got hurt, James and Irving were able to get to the basket whenever they wanted. Perhaps more importantly, when Bogut got hurt we were forced to replace him with Varajao, which needless to say was a MASSIVE downgrade.   &gt; Most teams don't even have a second top 20 player if their number one goes down but you guys have THREE  Wow it's interesting you mention that. Maybe that's why we keep winning all these playoff games. Maybe we're just a better basketball team than all the teams we play. Maybe luck has nothing to do with it."
"Because of the British Empire. It's popularity has inarguably faded since it's peak, particularly with the introduction of sporting competitions that have been globalized. TV rights, endorsements, sponsorships, etc? Cricket isn't there.   i.e. The average person has no idea who the worlds best cricket player is, but the average person I'm certain is familiar with LeBron James. "
u are great LEBRON JAMES
lebron james
Different situations. Goodell works for the NFL owners. Those are the only people he answers to and they like the job he's doing. Woj already reported some of the stuff tweeted by these burner accounts have been internal discussions by the Sixers. That effects credibility when it comes to Kawhi Leonard or LeBron James and throws the relationship with the players into disrepair. You can't keep that job if your credibility and relationships are destroyed. 
"So are you saying Dahntay Jones' ring from 2016 carries the same weight as LeBron James' ring from 2016? Not arguing that Robert Horry is at all similar to Dahntay Jones, just trying to prove a point."
LeBron James isn't a role player  It's a disservice to him to have him become a shooter 
How dare they speak about 76ers legend Lebron James that way. 
"When the Cavaliers pull out a miraculous win insha'Allah, everybody gonna be saying LeBron James is the GOAT."
Ok fuck Dirk Nowitzki and fuck LeBron James.   Steve Nash is a bitch and I hope Donovan Mitchell has a fucking trash career   I'll let you guys hate who you want if you let me hate who I want without whining 
LeBron James. James. James Potter. Potter. Harry Potter. 
"&gt; What puts Jayson Tatum into the conversation with the likes of Anthony Davis and LeBron James?  The fact that he's 19.  The idea that 2017-2018 Tatum was in the same tier as this year's version of Davis or James is *laughable*. Tatum wasn't a full blown star this year, let alone a superstar.  But assuming by ""in the conversation with the likes of Davis and James"" you mean something reasonable like ""becoming a top 10 NBA player"" it's not unreasonable to like just-turned-19-y.o. Tatum's chances better than about-to-turn-23-y.o. Porzingis's."
"The 73-9 Warriors team beats the Cavaliers in 2016, with a godly performance by Stephen Curry winning him FMVP (in actuality, Harrison Barnes simply makes two more corner threes).  Kevin Durant announces his intention to sign with the New York Knicks before Joakim Noah's signing. Durant thrives on the cutting and isolation provided by the Triangle and beats the Cavaliers in the ECF in an epic 7 game duel between him and LeBron James.  The Warriors sweep the Knicks for a successful threepeat.  "
 Aka be creative in trying to sign LeBron James 
I heard lebron james likes dark souls..
"- Carmelo Anthony finally signs with the Bulls.   - Durant forces Golden State to not take a pay cut to join them, then they give up assets and trade players for cap space then pretends to an voice agreement until he signs with Sacramento on a 5-year 170 million dollar deal.  - John  Wall is a Wizard for life.  - Philly hangs up on Boston in the previous summer and draft Tatum  - Orlando redo the Nick Anderson free-throws in the finals, to drastically change the series and eventually win the series. Shaq stays with Orlando instead of leaving them, leaving LA with Kobe Bryant and Van Exel by themselves.    - Seattle avoids losing their team and crowdfunds a new arena in 2009.  - Tracy McGrady stays with Toronto.  - NBA rules out taking pay cuts if you are an all-star   - Dennis Smith Jr is the next Shannon Brown  - Lakers become a contender in the next 2 years  .... and LeBron James signs with the Cleveland Browns and leads them to a first round exit in the NFL playoffs."
"Ahh I’m not sure it even makes sense to compare westbrook with Durant or James.  They are all primary options, but they all play pretty different games.  Also Lebron James has said himself that Durant has been right up there with him, and I’m pretty sure he would know how close Durant is to himself, better than anyone. "
also the same Lebron James they forced to leave Cleveland. Lol
he said his tired of coming second to LeBron james...that's saying you want to be better and greater than LeBron james. He has said he wants to be considered one of the best. With the move he made he cant do it. He legit is being handed a ring almost. Like he could have went to the spurs or rockets or something then he would have got a lot more respective its pretty much a known fact that's the weakest move by a superstar of all time. I think he just gave up on it and is trying to get rings. Which is fine and all but he kinda fucked the nba up as a entire whole. Now LeBron will prolly join the spurs or the rockets or something then it will be a two way race again. 
"curry/klay/dray/barnes had no hate prior to the 2014-15 season. so just cut that off.  only those four though.  &gt;2013: traded for igodala, lost to LAC in the first round  Exactly. You know how they got Iggy? Iguodala was the star for the Denver Nuggets and co-led (w/ Lawson) them to 57 wins then they face the lower 6th seed Warriors in that series, the Nuggets lose and then Iggy waddles his way to GSW, basically being a 'snek' and did a KD before KD.  Then in 2015 they face Lebron James, Smith, Delly and struggle with them but still win -- Cleveland was without two star players. Also the fact that the MVP of that year (Curry) was terrible and a lower star Iggy got FMVP and carried that team left a bitter taste in everyones mouth. Then Klay played extremely inconsistent for a star.  prior to those finals they faced injury-riddled teams like Memphis.  In 2016, their 73 win season they basically won 73 GAMES. Then underperform in the playoffs. Unacceptable and then after that they sign KD. Their hate is totally warranted."
"Little did he know, that was the same LeBron James that eliminated him in 2012.  Video source: https://twitter.com/MikeGoldFool/status/1001841486256885760"
"Lebron is the best player. What the Cavaliers need to be is the best team. If they're not, no amount of LeBron James is going to win it for them. "
"So post Jordan there was sort of a lul in the superstar department.  Kobe was there but he was like a high quality knock off of what you use to have the real thing for.  Then Lebron came, was hyped to no end, and has lived up to the hype.  When the Cavs wouldn't surround him with talent he left the first time basically creating the evil empire in miami.  He wins two ships, comes back to the cavs who this time are willing to put talent around him, and he continues the empire.  However at the same time the rebel forces led by steph curry rose and challenged him.  The first two years were insane.  In 2015 the injuries to Love and Irving highlighted just how far James had come since his first finals stint in Cleavland, but the warriors just played great basketball and won.  The following year Lebron and Co. got revenge in another classic series which was highlighted by arguably the best finals performance in history (leading all players in everything).  Then KD joined the Warriors and the tables were turned.  Suddenly they were the evil empire which needs to be dethroned.  As far as what to know for this series.  Take away the top player form both and one team is probably still in the finals, at least the WCF, the other doesn't make the playoffs.  There is a huge imbalance in the talent level of the two teams in the finals.  That leads to the ultimate david vs goliath storyline where somehow superman is david.  "

Why do people assume a LeBron James lead western team wouldn’t be amazing? The 2010s what western team that he would go to wouldn’t become instant? Y’all act like he going to Phoenix or Sacramento. 
"James Harden is considered the Rockets best player by everyone on this sub, everyone on here feels like CP3 was not the guy to lead a team, that he was perfect as a #2 option. He wasn't able to do it as a teams best player, but now he's on the Rockets, where he gets to be the 2nd best player, not to mention, he has always performed against the warriors. You're literally arguing against your own point now, Harden and CP3 do have a perfect supporting cast built around them, with a perfect system for those role players, you said the Cavs should be able to replicate what the Rockets did simply because people think Lebron is better than Harden. Not sure what random point you're trying to make now, are you trying to say Harden is better than Lebron and that is the only reason the Cavs didn't beat them last year and can't beat them this year? Any chance you'd tell me what team you were rooting for 5 years ago? Would give insight as to why almost all of your comment history is trashing Lebron and praising KD."
LeBron James Jr.
the only thing cleveland ownership did right was make sure lebron james was born in ohio
It's not going to be. Either he's fired or he's completely proven innocent. The owners would choose LeBron James over Bryan Colangelo 100% of the time.

"Yes, but he's older than one would have to be in order to be named after LeBron James. "
"He's not wrong. Lebron James, Paul George, Demarcus Cousins, etc. COULD all agree to take 2yr 30 million total deals and go somewhere... like somewhere with Cap Space... and maybe great weather... perhaps the West Coast... with women... and a lot of opportunities for future business investments"
Do not sign Chris Paul.  Trade away Ryan Anderson and 2 future 1st round picks.  Sign Will Barton.  Sign Tyreke Evans.  Sign LeBron James.
Lebron James. Nuff said.

"I'm saying are you dumb for saying it's not close.  Tatum is great don't get me wrong. But KP has a significant offensive and defensive edge over him. KP is still 22, that ACL injury won't be anything that will hamper is career. Westbrook also tore his ACL and plays at a much higher intensity than anyone not named LeBron James, and he's perfectly fine. As for bigs, Al Harrington, Al Jefferson, those are examples of bigs who tore their ACL and came back even stronger. No worries about that"
"Hey, to the victors go the spoils. You win, you go to the Finals, that's the time you talk your shit.   I think it's lame to even go that route, but if anyone's going to say it and ""have the right to say it"", it's someone on the Warriors or LeBron James. "

Does anyone else realize that LeBron James is really good at basketball?
"If a team in a fairly big market which has LeBron, CP3, and James Harden on it, the owner better shell out tons of money."
"Because that's the only way I see the situation playing out.  LeBron isn't going to San Antonio with only Lamarcus Aldridge as his number two.    I'm sure if James wanted to go to the Spurs, that would eliminate any dissent Kawhi would have towards the organization.  Any player would be crazy to refuse to play with LeBron.    "
 Rockets with LeBron James vs Celtics will be a fun finals next year

Lebron James
"This is really the playbook for any team in any sport that can't win on skill - turn the game into a wrestling match.  To use an extreme example, a redditor can't beat LeBron James 1 on 1, but if you allow them to tackle and take out his legs every time he so much as breathes, that significantly evens the odds."
"It's a sunny afternoon in Cleveland and Savannah had unexpectedly finished her charity event a few hours early. She is eager to get home to her basketball GOAT husband, Lebron James. Upon entering the house she notices an unfamiliar jacket on the coat rack and a pair of unusual shoes. To her horror she hears strange noises coming from the upstairs bedroom. With her high heels still on, she flies up the stairs and kicks the bedroom door down. There stood Lebron butt naked with his mistress on their knees still going to work. Savannah cried, ""WHY LEBRON?? WHY????"". Lebron replied, ""I thought you knew. Nick has been sucking me off every weekday at 6:30AM Eastern Time on Fox Sports"""
"prefer MJ over LeBron for GOAT but ELO says LeBron faced tougher competition in the finals.  https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/lebrons-nba-finals-opponents-mjs/story?id=47911521  &gt; Add it all up, and James has faced eight of the 35 best NBA finalists. If you take the average all-time rank of each of his Finals opponents, you end up with a mean rank of 19. Do the same for Jordan, and you land on an average of 35. That basically means the average team Jordan faced in the NBA Finals is the same as the worst team James ever played on the biggest stage."
"Agreed, it’s a common claim that LeBron underplaying was the reason they lost, not understanding that it was a side effect of the adjustments Carlisle made. The Mavs exposed Miami’s weakness and forced James hand to read defenses and make the correct pass, only that our team did not have 1/2 the shooting it did in 2012 or 2013.   Had James been more aggressive with scoring, it would have likely ended up in Miami winning, but at the same time Dallas was daring him to hit the open man with the pass, but that open man would be someone who couldn’t hit the shot or finish the play as Dallas recovered.  It was tough to watch. "
"lol ask Lebron james himself who the better scorer, he'll tell you KD. Yall need to calm down"
Also your full name needs to be two first names.  -Michael Jordan  -Lebron James  
"First name Lebron, last name James."
"It depends on who wins it.  It's more important for the all time great players.  If Jordan doesn't win six finals MVPs, the LeBron/Jordan debate would be much different.

Guys like Iggy, Cedric Maxwell, and James Worthy, it really doesn't affect their all time status all that much"

LeBron James Jr
&gt;The 2018 NBA Finals will feature LeBron James leading in 10 of the 18 traditional counting statistics.
The 2018 NBA Finals will feature LeBron James
I mean I thought people already knew that there was a gap. It's lebron James. He's an arguable goat. 
"If Ainge and LeBron both wanted to do it then it's actually pretty easy to make it happen. It would require some cold-blooded shit though:  LeBron would opt in to his player option on the condition that the Cavs trade him to Boston for matching salary. Boston would also need to include an asset like a first round pick (wouldn't have to be SAC or MEM, could be ours or Clippers lotto protected 2019 first) to get Cleveland to do it.  The question is how to match salary. You could trade Hayward, who plays the same position and would be enough to match salary, but that would be extremely cold-blooded. You could trade Horford and run out Kyrie and 4 wings. You could pull troll lord supremem and trade Kyrie back to Cleveland for LeBron even (you'd need to include another piece like a Morris or something but that's not really an obstacle).   So if both parties wanted to do it LeBron James could become a Boston Celtic without too much trouble. "
"Cavs were historically good on offense last year and lost pretty handily. The narrative was that wow even Lebron with a historically good offense and two all stars on his team lost in 5. KD broke the league.   Rockets took the Warriors to 7, showed they were somewhat vulnerable, had two games to close them out and in both times suffered massive second half collapses leading to a series loss.   In the case of the Rockets, the games were theirs to lose. Bad turnovers, pace of play and shot selection had more to do with their loss. James Harden also shot pretty poorly. In the Finals last year, Lebron put forth an incredible performance, the team played pretty well too but they were just outgunned at every turn and didn't have the pieces to defend the Warriors."
"Dirk has given up nearly $200 million in salary so that we can fail to sign Deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Deron Williams, Carmelo Anthony, and LeBron James, and instead sign Chandler Parsons and Harrison Barnes to max contracts and let Tyson Chandler (the only competent center in our franchise history) walk not once but twice. Dallas doesn't deserve him. "
"If they ended before the Knicks dance routine it would’ve been a decent rom-com that wasn’t overly sappy, I would’ve liked it much better. That being said I now want a John Cena and LeBron James buddy cop movie. "
LeBron James.
"Yeah, social media in general is just an awful landscape. I don't envy anyone trying to navigate it.  But you compare KD to LeBron, who has 10x the pressure and attention on him that Durant does, and he handles it so much better. I'm not a fan of James on the court (the flopping, complaining, it's too much), but off-court he's a great ambassador for the game. He fields constant questions about his successes, his failures, his effort levels, what his legacy will be, and he just rolls with it.  He always owns his mistakes, doesn't pretend to be perfect, and he uses his platform to elevate causes and champion the rights of players to stand up for their beliefs in the face of an industry that wants them to shut up and play ball.  KD on the other hand, mostly spends his media time sulking, refusing to answer tough questions, and any time anything pointed comes up, he attacks the media as if he doesn't understand at all how the world of being a rich celebrity works in the 21st century. Tabloid journalism is rough, but he needs to learn to deal with it better."

IF YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THAT WINNING RINGS WOULD MAKE KD BETTER AT BASKETBALL THAN LEBRON JAMES THAN YOU DON'T WATCH THE SAME SPORT THAT I DO 
"James Harden drove to the basket 144 times over the course of the conference finals.  Next highest in either series was LeBron at 108.  Nobody else did it more than 81 times.  Dude was trying to score the basketball.  People on here are like Trump voters with how they will question anything they see, including video evidence and stats, to fit their narratives"
"&gt;  the Cavs have two of the strongest punches you can throw, Lebron James and 3 point shooting  Lebron is a strong punch, The Cavs 3 point shooting not so much, especially against the Warriors defense."
Toronto is Lebron James alt-account
"I think it would make more sense to trade Gasol, Gay, and let Kyle Anderson walk. Green is an ideal shooting-guard to start next to Lebron James. Either that or trade White and Paul.   Having said that, I think Lebron probably doesn't want to go play for a team that beat him in the finals, then prompting him to leave the Heat and go to Cleveland. He might not want to hear the narrative ""if you couldn't beat them, then join them."" Now, that finals series was 4 years ago, but that Spurs team still has Pop, Parker, Kawhi, Green, Mills, and Ginobili. Granted, Ginobili and Parker are not quite the players they were back then, and Green has declined a bit, but its still some shocking roster.   It is also a huge gamble on his part. Yes, maybe a coach like Pop can put any 8 guys around Lebron and win a ring. But maybe he needs Kawhi to get past the Western Conference. That makes Kawhi's injury concern a big risk.   Then there's the coaching thing: how much does Lebron actually want to play for a genius coach who micro-manages the offense? In theory it should be a match made in heaven, but what if Lebron actually doesn't want to play for a coach who is going to force him to adapt as opposed to adapting for him?   tl;dr Don't trade Green, make up the salary somewhere else. There are pros and cons for Lebron going to the Spurs which he will consider accordingly "
"You can’t prove circumvention or prosecute on it. Without evidence.   And given the issue of rebuilding with Kawhi the hornets would stand fast on Marvin.  Given you have gotten rid of Marvin or Zeller in the Kawhi trade. Even keeping one of them lowers the cap commitments significantly because mkg would opt out I believe. The cap continues to go up, I don’t see why mkg wouldn’t opt out by then when some of the bad contracts on teams vanish.   They do need written proof. That’s the only reason Joe Smith and Minnesota got caught.  Jordan’ and Charlottes position is unique. One that the nba has never addressed and has allowed an opportunity like this.  It’s less obvious than say Gilbert hiring lebron as ceo of Quicken and circumventing with a lessened salary. Or Mickey Arison giving LeBron James a Miami club to own while he takes a paycut.   Kawhi just has to say he wants to win. Nothing prevents his from taking less or a shoe company paying more for his services. You can’t stop it. Discretion or not. Owners may not like it. Try to amend it in the future. Nba doesn’t own these hornets like they did with cp3.  I have no idea what an assistant said to Kawhi. But most contact would could from Pop, fellow players or management. Assistant coaches don’t usually stick their noses in.  The experience Borrego could use to his advantage. He can say he never agreed with how they handled Kawhi and now that he has his own position to change that. He can distance himself. It’s pretty simple to see that. You’re the one making assumptions about Borrego. So I countered with ways he can actually use it to his advantage. Ofcourse he left for a better job. That doesn’t mean he couldn’t sell his perspective knowing more about it than any other coach out there.   This is literally the trade Jordan talked about doing for Kemba. I think it is a darkhorse.   May I ask what team you support? Nvm Sixers. A possible contender for Kawhi.   So where is he going? In your estimation. Because I’m not saying Charlotte is the favourite just they have a shot. Low key city. Jordan connection and extra money."
The 2 lineups I've been hearing about the Lakers building if they get LeBron could be the most lethal or the tallest team I can remember ever being assembled. Maybe the most athletic either way + LaVar blaming LeBron for Lonzo not scoring would be hilarious (at first)  PG-Chris Paul 6' SG-Kawhi Leonard 6'7 SF-Lebron James 6'8 PF- Paul George 6'9 C-Julius Randall 6'9  Or... PG-Lonzo Ball 6'6 SG-Brandon Ingram 6'9 SF-Lebron James 6'8 PF-Paul George 6-9 C-Demarcus Cousins 6'11
“Orlando magic get: Lebron James”   Imma stop you right there chief.
"Embiid plays the most important position for defense but even then he doesn't match up defensively to Kawhi. Kawhi also had a worse supporting cast last year (Aldridge was in a funk). The 9 games this season aren't even fair considering he was just coming back and it turned out he was still injured. On top of all this, Kawhi had an extraordinary and historical playoff run last year that ended with a horrible Zaza closeout, just when it looked like Kawhi was stealing a game from the vaunted Golden State Warriors. Compare that to Embiid who was unable to lead his team past a Celtics squad missing their best 2 players.  You're insane if you're saying Simmons is better than PG. I don't know how this narrative that Simmons is better than some players who have shown they are consistent stars/superstars, but it's definitely wrong, especially in this case. Simmons was great against the Heat in the first round, but its also worth noting the Heat were led by a 36 year old far out of his prime. Against an opponent missing their two best players and another rookie vying for ROTY, Simmons didn't only lose - he let loose a terrible performance. He was the main reason the 76ers lost to the Celtis. PG on the other hand consistently did well against the Heat's Big 3, which included arguably the greatest player ever - LeBron James. To say Simmons is better than PG is foolhardy. It's also worth noting that Simmons couldn't even make it as an All-Star fill-in in the East, while PG was able to do so in the West, a much harder conference. Many people also noted that he should have been an All-Star to begin with, while barely anyone argues that for Simmons."

"imma take gigantic ass career wilt or shaq over big game james. doesn't matter if they can't play at pf, they create so much gravity on offense they will tire out the team's defense and give kobe/lebron/magic so many playmaking opportunities and putbacks."
"Ok, you realise that VORP is a cumulative stat right? You also realise MJ had two Wizards seasons and two contracted seasons (due to injury and a comeback) all affecting his career VORP? That's 177 games. If you take 177 games from LeBron his career VORP becomes very similar to Jordan's, slightly higher yes but certainly not 'way higher' as you suggest. Also, Jordan's includes two seasons where he was older than James is now. If you look at Jordan's career up until the same age, again discounting his contracted years, his average per season VORP becomes 9.6. LeBron's is 8.3. Finally, MJ's best VORP year was 12.0, LeBron's has been 11.6 (which is still below MJ's second best year). So when you look at it in its proper context, your argument has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese...."
"By contrast, Lebron James only has 11 letters, which is not nearly as many letters."
"really it goes by height even if I saw CP3 I would just expect he is a look a like,  williams possibly but there are still a decent number of people his height but Lebron or Dwight would be damn that guy is tall to damn is that lebron james "

"*Really?* Intangibles and Basketball IQ are off the chart. Just look at some of the passes and drives to the rim he did. Players with no prior professional experience don't do that. If he can develop any semblance of a shot, he'll be even more special than he already is.  You don't get compared to Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson, and LeBron James all season without having generational potential/talent."

"Yea, you misunderstood my statement in last sentence. I never mentioned that someone in NBA cant be depressed (I would be stupid to do so as there are proofs that people in NBA were in very weird mental places, most notably Ron Artest who gave a shoutout to his therapist when celebrating a title), I have never even came close to that statement. All I said is that not being in top 0.01% world in particular, highly sought after skill like determination/drive does not indicate someone is depressed. I dont think that way of thinking helps anyone. Thinking that if you are not equivalent of LeBron James or Elon Musk that MAYBE something is wrong with you - will probably have reverse effect. I am not saying that mental health is not a big problem society is facing, it is probably one of biggest problems (mostly because how neglected it has been) - but it is also good to let people just be what they are, and vast majority of us are not (well, by definition) in that 0.01%.   I am saying that as person who was seen as some second coming of Tesla for majority of my schooling - I simply stood out of the crowd. That was when I was a rather young, as time progressed I decided that I love spending time with my family, friends, my dog,... and while I am still excellent student I am not best student there ever was. I do great on some exams and worse on others, and I like it that way. I get to talk to my mother and father daily, full well knowing that they wont be around forever; I get to go on weekend trips with my sister when she catches few days off work;... and I wouldnt give that stuff up for anything. I took me long time realize who I am, and if there were people saying that maybe I am depressed because I decided to cut back on studying in order to spend time with people I love - there is a chance that my life would be different now, and I am guessing I wouldnt be as happy.  Again I am not attributing malice to neither you or person I responded to, but like you said these conversations are important and I think my point of view is defensible one.  Nice talk, cheers"
pathetic  LeBron fanatics are absurd...the guy ruined his legacy going to Miami and now yall want him on a stacked squad again further shitting on his legacy lmaooooo  guy could never be MJ's level not even Kobe. Kobe and MJ are 100000000x better than L3-6ron James.

"LeBron can play and defend all positions, it’s not even in question. What’s more important is what will he tolerate being assigned at this point. I’m guessing PG can play the 2, &amp; 3 most definitely and a little 4 if necessary. Kawhi’s got the potential to be the best defender of all the times.    Ingram is a 6’10-11 forward with guard experience.   In a starting lineup, you definitely slot Ingram depending on LeBron’s position. Him at the one means George and Ingram taking the 2 &amp; 3 interchangeably. James taking the 3 means Ingram taking the one with Leonard taking the four and pretty much the same implies for James taking the 4 with a Leonard 3 slotting.   I know Lonzo has the potential to be a generational talent but Ingram seems to be the more flexible of the two, especially when you get into the deeper units. "

"Maybe 29 year old LeBron could’ve done that.   But, 33 year old LeBron James, with more minutes on his legs than just about anyone else in the history of the game and playing the full season, definitely has to pick his spots and needed to pick his spots this postseason.   He’s still one of the best athletes in the world and the best in the game with a large gap between no. 1 &amp; no. 2.  But remember, LeBron James is no spring chicken.  "

"Idk how much we'd have to worry about free agents after getting Kawhi. We'd be capped out for the foreseeable future so I'm sure many people would forget about it the next time we have a shot at signing free agents. Also ring chasers/ players that want to increase their value with Brad will still fuck with us. And if a free agent held against us that we traded our prior free agent for Lebron James, best player in the world, then I don't want that player signing for the Celtics.  I think you'd have a point if we were talking about any GM not named Ainge. Danny Ainge does not care about optics. He's traded IT, Rondo, Pierce, and KG without a second thought and all of those players meant more to Boston and the Celtics than Hayward did. Ainge does what's best for the team, nothing more or less.   "

"Pop pretends to love guys like Magic Johnson, LeBron James, and Kawhi Leonard, but knifes them in the back when they never expect it, even if it's against his own self interest. "
"I mean not necessarily, the appeal of Pop is still there and the Spurs can still get a shit ton back for Kawhi.   They lose leverage because everybody knows he wants out, sure, but there’s still gonna be teams knocking down the door to get him in the building a year early and convince him to stay long-term.   Who’s to say they couldn’t hit up Boston and ask for Brown, Rozier, and a S/T of Marcus Smart?  Then they’d have Dejounte, Rozier, Smart, Brown,  Green, LMA, and Pau + LeBron.   He could probably sell Wade and Korver on coming as well.   G: Terry Rozier - Dejounte Murray - Marcus Smart G: Danny Green - Dwyane Wade - Manu Ginobli F: LeBron James - Jaylen Brown - Kyle Korver F: Rudy Gay - Kyle Andersen C: LaMarcus Aldridge - Pau Gasol  Not sure if they’d be able to keep Gay in this situation but with or without him it’s a Warriors challenging squad.  Enough scoring to keep up with anybody. Lots of big guards to bother Curry/Klay.  Enough perimeter defenders to try and slow down KD."

It doesn’t matter. The warriors just won two series allowing harden and lebron to be guarded by Steph. So please tell me why in the world they’d be concerned about Ben Simmons   Edit: also kawhi is the only defender I’d be “concerned” about no one is afraid of Ben Simmons or LeBron James on defense in 2018
"I expect a big paycut from redick. Pretty sure that was the arrangement.  I wouldn’t say Simmons is worthless without the ball, backdoor cuts and lobs, posting up his man.. he is basically another wade for LeBron.  Embiid certainly is physical which led to his face getting wrecked but Kyrie is just as injury prone. I think LeBron would make Embiid take less dumb 3s, More open ones and at the end of day having Joel play perimeter makes his a better defender who saves energy and opens the floor and brings a rim protector away from the hoop.   Let’s say the starting lineup is   Simmons   Redick   Covington   James   Embiid    Curry chases Redick, Klay has Simmons  Durant has Covington  Dray has James.. mcgee has Embiid?   Say they go Hampton 5  Curry-JJ, Klay-Simmons, Durant- Roco, Iggy-LeBron, Dray-Embiid   I think Embiid kills Dray. I don’t think Warriors have an answer for him. So they double. The rotation comes to LeBron who has an open 3 or attacks the defense and gets Covington/JJ/Saric open 3s   Anyways let’s see what happens with Kawhi "

"I am actually in the middle of this conversation with him as we speak. Essentially, he just doesn't like him as a player. He thinks he whines too much, throws his weight around behind the scenes, and is a flopper.   He actually respects what James has done off the court for kids and charity. He just hates him so much as a player that he can't get past it and can't root for the guy.   Me re-stating his opinion in no way means I agree with him. I really enjoy watching Lebron play and consider him the best of all time. "
"Go figure, r/NBA hates the Lakers more than it loves Lebron James. I had no idea"
Yeah I asked him if he'd feel the same way if they won it all and he said if they win it all with James he won't celebrate or brag. He said he'd rather struggle like they have been than have any success with Lebron. I don't get the insane amount of hate he has for James but I guess he's at least consistent.   We'll wait and see how steadfast he is on that if it becomes reality. 
I’m not LeBron James and I’m not making a career choice based on the schools in destination cities i might move to. 
"I gotta give my brother in law credit.   He's a lifelong Lakers fan and a longtime Lebron hater. He just told me even if they get Kawhi and James he's done with the team until James is gone. He refuses to root for him.   On the one hand, I think it's fucking stupid. But on the other, I respect the dedication. "

"I mean The Knicks are a decent threat. The would have enough talent to be a playoff team with KP as a CoStar and Nikatila as a compliment. He’s from there and would be able to play the narrative of saving the Knicks. It’s also the biggest market in the NBA and would do wonders for Kyrie’s already impressive brand.  I know most fans just care about winning a title, but the NBA is still a business. NY has to be pretty enticing despite James Dolan.   The Celtics will very likely be the best “basketball situation” for him, but he left LeBron because he want’s to be the face of a franchise.   I’m not saying he won’t resign, I just think it’s foolish to believe he’s a lock to resign. We shouldn’t be shopping him, but we should be listening to offers.

"Yes for that one year. If getting Kawhi convinces Lebron to commit to LA long term then that's a must-do trade but I doubt that's the case.  If getting Kawhi convinves Lebron to commit to LA for 1 season, it's also a great trade... **but's it still only 1 year of Kawhi**  + 1 year of Lebron James. 2019 FA you still have to sign Kawhi and if Lebron is gone your odds aren't improved compared to the no-trade scenario.  PG13 is the more important piece because he's likely to sign long term. My guess that his chances to go to LA are independent of Kawhi being there."
In time for Lebron James Jr. 
I'll delete my account if Lebron James and Damian Lillard are teammates on the 76ers.
"how bout a lakers team with Kevin Love, Demarcus Cousins, Lebron James, Dwyane Wade - you know what, just replace all their players with actually good ones.  would that imaginary lakers team do well?"
"But coming back to my senses, do the Lakers even have a great coaching staff and discipline? If Lebron James goes over there, I know he will be. Kawhi Leonard, I don't know how he will be used since he along with everybody was a role player in San Antonio. I don't know if pure talent and skill can take down the Warriors since Steve Kerr backs them up."

Do you think I'm Lebron James? 1-3 would have made more sense
"Not if the Lakers lack cap space in 2019 after free agency this year.  This can really backfire on Kawhi of the lakers are his true love.  Unless he goes to the Lakers this year in a trade that benefits the Spurs better than any other offer, than the Lakers would essentially have to punt this year on signing marquee free agents to keep that cap space open next year to sign him.  In other words, if the Lakers sign Lebron and Paul George this year...they won't have cap space to sign Leonard next year.    Kinda stupid to let this leak from the Leonard camp.  Because it Orlando offers a better deal than Deng, Ingram, and Kuzma (and they might, for various reasons....the Deng contract is a two year albatross no matter how good Ingram and Kuzma are)...then Leonard to the Lakers may not be possible next year, if James and PG sign this year.  And then James and PG are like ""wtf?!?  We needed a third superstar here, but our contracts tapped out the Lakers salary cap for 2019?!?  We can't win in LA with these young cats!""    No one thinks of the second, third order consequences of these actions.   The Spurs can trade Kawhi to wherever, indifferent to his wants.  The Lakers and Kawhi have less control over this than the Spurs do, because the Spurs can talk to 28 other teams who very well may take a one year chance at Kawhi.  "
Easier to win with Paul George and LeBron James though. 
LeBron James will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies
"if you really want to make a team with those 3 then it'd could be   PG: Lonzo Ball SG: Paul George SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Lebron James C:  Julius Randle/whoever else  LeBron can chill at PF and still run the offense, and then you have 3 amazing wing defenders in your stars"
Trade him to thr Cavs for the 7th pick. This would force Lebron James back to Cleveland and chaos among the league.
There was a [front page story on ESPN.com](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23776431/how-lakers-land-lebron-james-paul-george-kawhi-leonard-nba-free-agency) about two days ago laying out this *exact* scenario.
You forgot to mention the two Raptors legends Chris bosh and Lebron James 
"I'm curious if the Lakers offer Ball and Ingram if they know for a fact LeBron is coming.  Boston's advantage is that their contention is not predicated on any other good players arriving. They trade for Kawhi and they're probably the second best team in the NBA - although all Irving, Hayward and Leonard's talents post-injuries are TBD. Lakers with just Leonard and even George isn't good enough to make much noise. They need James."
"No, but he does a LOT of pieces about LeBron that could be considered hit pieces.  [Deadspin summary from 2011](https://deadspin.com/5811311/every-overwrought-thing-adrian-wojnarowski-has-said-about-lebron-james)  [This comment thread has some stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2a9sok/has_adrian_wojnarowski_ever_got_anything/cisvgdf/)"
"It doesnt distract me from the fact that in 2011, a 33 year old Jason Terry outscored a 26 year old Lebron James in the NBA Finals."

"Yes, Draymond isn't LeBron James capable of single-handedly doing everything for a team, but you're crazy to think that with even passable talent around him Draymond wouldn't be a huge positive influence. High-IQ leadership like that elevates the play of everyone else -- he would still be a coordinating force on defense, and if he had even passable offensive options his passing game and ability to read sets will make a team much better."
"LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Nick Young, David West."

I cannot feel bad for a fan of a team who just signed LeBron fucking James 
Cleveland only won because Lebron James is from Ohio
Who gives a fuck we got LeBron James
The Lakers won 35 games this year. If they win above 50 with no one else being super stand out then I can see LeBron winning it just because we don't have another hard narrative like James harden. But if lonzo supremely improves and averages like a 16/9/9 or Kyle kuzma averages above 25 points a game he could lose it. But this team is probably his best chance for #5
"Lebron did the same thing in MIAMI! James, Wade, Allen, Bosh, Miller was the original 5 man Allstar!"
"Let’s assume all players are healthy, and the Warriors are playing against the Eastern Conference All-Stars in a one-game 5-on-5 championship.   The Warriors have Draymond Green, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Steph Curry. Based on the 2018 All Star Game voting, the East brings out Kyrie Irving, DeMar DeRozen, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo. Let’s also assume Kristaps Porzingis fills the spot vacated by LeBron James given that he finished fourth in the Eastern frontcourt voting...   I would probably say the Warriors still win. Kyrie/Steph, DeMar/Klay, and Draymond/Joel (more or less) cancel one another out. Porzingis probably has a slight advantage over Cousins, but Durant has an even bigger advantage over Giannis. That isn’t meant to be a knock on either Cousins or Giannis - they’re both very good players. However, Porzingis (when healthy) is a generational talent, and Durant is an all-time great.   TLDR: It’s close, but the Warriors probably win down the stretch. "
"Curry - Yes   Klay - James Harden   Kevin Durant - Not even close to LeBron   Dray - Nope, there is a few players better   DMC - Yes if healthy"
Truly unprecedented to sign Lebron James in free agency and still have it feel like an afterthought just one day later
LeBron Fucking James
LeBron James.
LeBron James 
"That's exactly why he gets shit on so much. Redditors can take comfort when they see Lebron James succeeding because he's an absolute physical specimen and they can tell themselves that they could have all the skill in the world but just weren't born with the genes to make it to the nba. When they see a dude like IT, he reminds them they actually *could* have made it to the nba, they just aren't good enough to. "
"Sports are competitive and at the end of the day there are the haves and the have nots. So it will never be truly competitive. The Hornets are not on the same level as say the Lakers. When was it ever truly a competitive league? In the 80s it was either the Celtics or the Lakers, the 90s it was Jordan, 2000s Lakers and Spurs. 2010s Warriors and whatever team Lebron James is on. Superteams are the new norm just hope your team is in position to form one."
no way is Kawhi going to stay on the Clippers with LeBron James next door
2019-20 6th Man of the Year: LeBron James
"Magic is the undisputed best PG of All Time  Also Kevin Durant is nowhere near as good as Larry Bird, Larry Bird was basically a less Athletic Lebron James"
"Idk maybe if you enjoy the game you can just watch your own team, watch these Warriors team because they would be very fun to watch even if it is unfair or watch LeBron James because he is still the best player in the world. "
Warriors w/Lebron James&gt;The Avengers
"You're exposing how new you are.  &gt; LeBron has never faced a legitimate top ten player in the East  He faced Jason Kidd and Vince Carter in 2006. Gilbert Arenas in 2007. Kevin Garnett in 2008. Dwight Howard in 2009. Derrick Rose in 2010 and 2011. Rondo in 2012, Paul George in 2014, Kyle Lowry in 2016, Isaiah Thomas in 2017, Demar Derozan in 2018.  According to top 10 MVP voting these guys were all top 10 players at the time they faced Lebron.  &gt;and has had at worst an All Star on his team since 2010  In 2015 Love got injured in the 1st round. Kyrie was hobbled throughout the 2nd round and then missed games in the 3rd round.  In 2016 neither Love or Kyrie were allstars.  In 2018 Love was out in games 6 and 7 against Boston.  &gt;He literally started the trend of ganging up with All Stars in their prime.  No, this has always been the case. Lebron created his Miami superteam to compete with Boston's superteam. Before that Shaq and Kobe, Magic, Kareem and Worthy, Bird and McHale and Parish, Jordan, Pippen, and Grant/ Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman.  &gt;LeBron hasn't had any competition outside the Finals since he went to Miami.   Two 6 game series with Indiana (2012 and 2014). Two 7 game series with Indiana (2013 and 2018). Two 7 game series against Boston (2012 and 2018). One 6 game series with Chicago in 2015.   In other words, everything you said is wrong and you know nothing about Lebron James."

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH You just got LeBron James. Be happy! 
Bruh my team just got Lebron James and IM in full support of a hard cap. This is fucking bullshit at this point with GSW.  
no no you look at your team if you want to see non competitive.  My team has LeBron James

"I had to look this up cause I was super curious too.   &gt;	The bi-annual exception will also increase. The expected maximum salary in 2017-18 for a player with 10 or more year’s service—including many of the game’s superstars, like LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Chris Paul, each of whom can become an unrestricted free agent next summer, will be $36 million, allowing a player to sign a five-year deal with his existing team for around $210 million. [(Dec 2016) NBA, NBPA reach tentative seven-year CBA agreement](http://www.nba.com/article/2016/12/14/nba-and-nbpa-reach-tentative-labor-deal) "
You just got LeBron James. Don't be too sad.
"Imagine Lakers Rondo playing the Celtics in the final. If you find it bizarre, think what a celtics fan would feel. Rondo represents their only ring in the last 32+ years. And has been publicly on the outs with a [guy who signed](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/rondo-ray-allen-celtics-lakers-lebron-james-feud-miami-heat-boston-nba-free-agency) up to get a ring elsewhere"
For once I wish Lebron James wasn't this highly respectable guy who always says the right thing. He Needs to say some shit about how this is stupid and isn't right. This wasn't meant to be how the NBA worked. It's sooooo fucking dumb. We are missing the greatest player of all time possibly winning rings because of this bullshit. Anyone who still says Jordan would be undefeated for rings in this era is a fucking idiot.
"Yeah.  LeBron James has NEVER taken a salary below max.  NEVER WILL!  Because he has integrity and loves the Players Association!  Oh, wait..."
"I know this subreddit is low on Trae Young but I’m here to disagree with every single one of you.   People trash on him and the Hawks for trying to imitate the Warriors. And they’re right that Trae Young isn’t Steph Curry.   But you know what? Ben Simmons isn’t Lebron James. But he shares several of the same core components, and that’s enough to make him a star.   Same thing with Young, in my opinion. I think he’ll be a star in this league. I’m fucking HYPE"
*LeBron James traded to Lakers*  Warriors: Are you threatening me Master James?  LeBron: the Western Conference Finals will decide your fate.  Warriors: I *am* the Western Conference! 
"They didn't draft as good as the Warriors and smaller market. I mean, what other choices do you have? Wait for Minneapolis to create the next Lebron James who is loyal to the Wolves?"
"and they were traded for. the pick for james harden was traded for allen. KG had a large package around him. They didn't sign for pennies on the damn dollar.   The lakers traded for Pau and gave Memphis Marc Gasol who was instrumental in their playoff run (also led to the cash to get randolph).   They're hardly the same things. Lebron however when he went and signed with guys, not for the most money started all this shit. "
We signed Lebron James. 
Jesus! Fucking Christ! I just bought my Lebron James   Lakers jersey.  Can I still return it?
"I am saying the truth. Randle was excited at the prospect of playing with LeBron James, but the FO did their BS moves.  Hopefully they don't trade away the young players who are left because it's the fans that suffer.  The franchise gets their revenue anyway.  The mess is passed on to the next FO.  But the [Lakers] (fans) usually don't just switch teams and are forced to watch mediocre basketball and start all over."

LeBron James is also a Democrat. :(
"You’ve deleted multiple comments because you’re not making sense.    Are you seriously telling me that giving forth more effort, will take no more stamina?  This is why your points don’t make sense.    Once again I never said he chooses not to play defense so that he can save his energy for offense.   If he chooses to never play good defense, then him having more energy for offense is a by-product of his lackluster defense.     If effort was all mental like you claim it to be, then why don’t soccer players sprint literally nonstop all game?  Why do running backs ever leave the game for plays to rest when they aren’t injured and it’s a running play?  Why would LeBron James ever sit on the bench?  You have limited stamina.  That’s the point of resting on the bench.  If you have limited stamina then you can’t give 100% nonstop all game long.  "

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kevin Durant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched the Slim Reaper in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Durant's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SF ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Durant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Durant in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Durant is better. You might be jealous of Durant's two rings, or jealous of his status as the one of the greatest scorers in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Durant isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Durant talk to the adults. Fair?"
"I don't follow the NBA, but I do read about it occasionally. I can probably name 20 current NBA players. I know all 5 of the Warriors starters.

Kevin Love  That guy with the unibrow  The European who Michael Rappaport freaked out about when the Knicks drafted him   Lavar? Ball  Swaggy P?   Kawhi Leonard    "

LeBron James announces his retirement from the NBA at age 33.
"Cleveland's second biggest export is crippling depression, though, so they're used to it.  Their biggest export financially is of course Lebron James."
"Lonzo Ball, Rondo, Stephenson, Lavar Ball, picks, and cash considerations to HOU for Chris Paul, James Harden  Ingram, Kuzma, Deng, McGee, and the 2023 draft rights to Bronny Jr. to MIN for Jimmy Butler, Karl Anthony Towns   Paul  Harden  Butler  Lebron  KAT  Who says no?"
All those stuff happens because LeBron James Decision 1.0 
"So this is how Lakers can beat this Warriors team with Boogie:  Get Kawhi somehow,  Ask Kobe to return from his retirement  Tell Melo to agree the buyout and join Lakers for minimum  Get Brook Lopez for minimum using the magic touch of the magician GM  Starting lineup:  Lonzo  Kobe  Kawhi Leonard  Lebron James  Brook Lopez  Subs:  Rondo  Ingram  Kuzma  Mcgee  KCP"
"After a moment of reflection, maybe this is more then just getting an easy route to a championship.  Cousins got turned down by the Pelicans and isn't going to get a high value contract based on concerns from an achilles tear.  At Golden State, he doesn't have to play right away, its only a 1 year contract, and if he performs well he could get a huge contract next year when teams are sold he is recovered.  All the money right now was allocated for  LeBron James, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard.  Next year will look better for him with a huge contract.  For Golden State, this is a boon where they can swallow the downside if he doesn't play.  And he can take the 6-8 months to fully recover and be a huge asset come playoffs."
LeBron James is pretty much Thanos and GSW is Avengers. 
My exact thoughts.. Max contracts create issues by trying to say there is a world where Blake Griffin and Lebron James are worth the same amount.
"""I always believed that I’d return to Cleveland and finish my career there. I just didn’t know when. After the season, free agency wasn’t even a thought. But I have two boys and my wife, Savannah, is pregnant with a girl. I started thinking about what it would be like to raise my family in my hometown. I looked at other teams, but I wasn’t going to leave Miami for anywhere except Cleveland. The more time passed, the more it felt right. This is what makes me happy."" -lebron james biggest liar to ever come to c town im not leaving im gonna finish my career here, fuck you and fuck all the lebron 15s i brought and fuck u MG87 u just dont get it "
only a lakers fan would post this unironically after signing lebron james
"After this season Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, And Andre Igoudala will finish the season with 4 rings, more than LeBron James"
Oh no we signed LeBron James however will we recover
"Lol, you just signed Lebron James, you have no right to be salty "
"Lebron James, james harden, Anthony Davis, giannis or Leonard , Kyrie Irving or Chris Paul "

"LeBron James signs a $160m, 4 year deal with the New York Yankees, league sources tell ESPN"
"Lebron James with Kawhi Leonard and three capable vets is already better than James Harden and CP3 and three capable vets, so why would they take a risk on Brandon Ingram possibly becoming someone, someday when they could trade away for a team that would probably be at worst the 3rd or 4th best team in the west?"

"Why not the Warriors? Everyone’s going to the f*cking Warriors how bout he just goes there? F******* bull****. F*** the NBA. F*** KD.   Screw the Warriors.   But seriously they might as well add LeBron while they’re at it. Maybe throw in James Harden, CP3, and Anthony Davis into the mix as well "
"haha, we signed Lebron James"
"THANK LEBRON JAMES. For being the first superstar in his prime to form a super team- this changed the league forever. Before him, no young talent had ever broken the spirit of competition to do this.  It's only a shame that Ray Allen and Kyrie bailed him out and got him some rings."

Yeah a huge factor between their spacing last year to this year is now theyll have lebron fucking james

I see your LeBron James and raise you one DeMarcus Cousins.. your move NBA
"I mean, he was assisted on 85% of his threes, and 42% of his 2 pointers his three most recent healthy years.   Compare that to LeBron who was assited on 46.1% of his threes and 34.3% of his 2 pointers the last three years.   James Harden: 36% of his threes and 12.5%(!!!) of his 2's the last three years.   I mean, obviously he's not a system guy. But he did get assisted on over 50% of his baskets. (Exact number is 53.07% in case you're curious). So I'm guessing, although I could be wrong, that his overall efficiency will go down. Though it'd be shocking if he wasn't still extremely good offensively, and obviously it takes nothing away from his otherworldly defense."
They're not winning either way. If that was their goal they've fucked it. They could have gotten LeBron James for DeRozan and still not won. Now the only guy who actually loved the city gets stabbed in the back. Only thing this will do is let them rebuild quicker. 
"James Harden dropped a 38 spot on his head. George dropped 33. KD did just fine against him too. Lets not even get into Lebron just having his way.  He's a great young defender, but y'all are proving my point about him being overrated. He's not clamped those guys. He's competed against them which is more than you can ask of most rookies."
"It would have been funny if told by somebody with comedic timing and composure. Jokes that like you gotta save for the “roast of Lebron James” though. The JR joke was funny and the tattoo joke was lame but once again, execution. A comedian known for deadpan would have nailed them. "
You legitimately just said you'd take 2016 Curry over both LeBron James and prime *Michael fucking Jordan* if they were all in the same season. I never said that GS wasn't legendary. I said greatness is made in the finals and you are no ranking 2016 Steph over the GOATS when he straightup lost to a GOAT.   Why you brought any of that up is beyond me. I never said you were nothing in 2016. I didn't even mention the Warriors being anything less than legendary. Learn to fucking read before you throw your temper tantrums.   
"Totally different scenario. The Lakers have finished a rebuild and are moving forward with a promising young core, LeBron James, and enough cap space to sign a star player next year. "
DeMar just can’t escape Lebron James 
"Better than Kyle Singler, worse than LeBron James"
"Not necessarily better. But it does show that you can adapt to different environments. The one common factor between those three rings is LeBron James. Even though Jordan was obviously the reason they won those rings, he never did it without Pippen. Some might argue that it was easier because he never had to adapt to having a completely different team around him."
As much as I like to shit on the lakers it's hard not to look at the 2019 FA class and think -somebody- is going to go play with LeBron James. I really think Kawhi might end up a Clipper or Raptor but there's still a bunch of really good players who will be free agents that summer.
"Down by one to the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Raptors needed to make one more huge basket to avoid getting bounced in the 2018 NBA Playoffs. Demar Derozan took the ball in this important possession with Lebron James guarding him. Eventually, James stepped back and gave Derozan the space to shoot the rock. “Shoot it you fucking midget,"" LBJ barked. The 6-foot-7 guard obliged and didn't come close. The Cavaliers won the game, 85-84, and moved onto the finals to play the Boston Celtic.   According to Dwane Casey, who was a coach on that 2018 Raptors team, Derozan told him that moment ruined his career.  He was never the same, averaging just 0 3PA for the remainder of his career after significantly improving his 3 point shot the year before. Cold."
"Wade, Bosh, Allen, Haslem and more all got credit in Miami. From the media, fans, LeBron, etc...  Kyrie gets plenty of credit.  Players have gotten paid and gotten opportunities (delly) because of LeBron boosting their game and ALWAYS giving them credit and love in interviews.  &gt; [LeBron James voted ""player you secretly"" want on your team by NBA players' union](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/07/lebron_james_players_awards_be.html)  Your comment completely contradicts reality."
"I'm surprised at how upvoted the comment is with putting Lowry top 15.  Kyrie, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, James Harden, Steph Curry, John Wall, Giannis, LeBron, KD, Anthony Davis, Russell the Muscle, Paul George, KAT, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert and Klay Thompson are people I think are definitively better than him. Then there's Bradley Beal, Gordon Hayward(injury concern for him), DeMarcus Cousins, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol are people who when healthy I'd argue were better than him. But I don't think he's top 15. Maybe top 25 if you think he's better than DeRozan, I don't."
"If he's 100%, then yes.  He'll still be the most dominant wing defender in the league and put up 20+ppg on good efficiency.  He's literally the only guy I've ever seen make Lebron James go ""Fuck!"" when he checks into the game."
"This is some legit revisionist history. There were plenty of people who were mad at Lebron for ring chasing/joining a talented group of players. It's difficult to say what the ""majority"" of people felt, but there was an overwhelming feeling that Lebron was coping out by joining a superteam.    https://np.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/cnir8/its_official_lebron_james_has_announced_he_will/  &gt;That last paragraph is exactly why Lebron will never reach the level of Bird, Magic, Kobe, Jordan, etc. He chose to join a team that already had an allstar/future HOFer. In this case, LeBron is playing the role of the ""last piece"" added to make a championship team. All the other guys carried their respective teams, James is just attaching himself to another team. If he had gone to Chicago, he would be the unquestioned #1 and leader of the team, but now in Miami, who knows?  You could basically replace Lebron with Durant in a lot of the comments and it would magically be 2018.    &gt;Bill Simmons wrote about this in one of his article, but he basically said that maybe LeBron wants to be the final piece. He doesn't have the killer instinct that Kobe and Jordan have and he's OK playing a Pippen-type role. Simmons compared him to Julius Erving: an athlete who is more concerned with amazing everyone with spectacular plays than winning. Erving only won a single championship (in 1981), it was (arguably) only the addition of Moses Malone to the Sixers that pushed them over the edge. Maybe LeBron just wants to have fun playing basketball with his friends and win some championships along the way? Maybe he doesn't care about his legacy, or being the greatest ever, he just wants to enjoy life. I mean, from a marketing standpoint, I can't see how going to a saturated Miami market (with Bosh and Wade) will help his image."

Lebron James
I mean his ceiling kinda remains to be seen because he ran into Lebron James three times. 
&gt; It feels like she's taken quid pro quo a step further than a lot of her peers.  Yeah not like that Windhorst guy. he's so unbiased about Lebron James it's ridiculous.
"DeRozan isn’t that good tho. Not compared to the expected MVP candidates. James Harden, KD, Dame, Lebron, Curry, AD, KP, Giannis will all get it before him. He would have to literally take his game to a new tier. "
"Yes, it probably has nothing to do with the free agent actually being from the area and being drafted originally by that team.   If LeBron James is born anywhere else, he leaves the first time and never comes back.   Hell, his own family didn't even want him going back to Ohio.   LeBron's situation with the Cavs is a once in a million situation in which teams would be retarded to bank on happening as a free agent strategy.   ""Oh just hope the we get the #1 pick for the best player since Jordan AND he grew up in our backyard. Let's hope he leaves and feels bad about not winning a ring for a historic loser city and comes back when the team just so happens to have ANOTHER #1 pick to use as trade fodder with a 3RD #1 pick emerging as a superstar. Oh and that best player since Jordan has to lose in the finals the previous year facilitating his exit. Easy peasy. Happens all the time.""   "
I always think that people take these too far as well.   But I can kinda see his situation. He wanted to be in Toronto. He openly loved that organization and city. How many talented NBA players are gonna say the same?   He felt like that was his home. So imagine you are planning your life and things with your family and find out now you have to move to another state where you don't want to go. Sucks. Sure making millions and millions you do it anyways. But it still sucks.   And then you get traded for somebody that likely is only gonna be a 1-year rental. They traded you for somebody that isn't even gonna help them past this season. Which would have to seem like a slap in the face.   Especially for a guy that left a bunch of money on the table to be in Toronto.   Lebron James has been the bane of your existence and now he is in the Western Conference. The Eastern Conference just got easier... and you get traded to the Spurs.   Its a shitty situation. I think its shitty for the Raptors fans.
"He plays the same position as LeBron James and Kevin Durant, who are easily top five players at their position of all time, and now play in the same conference. I don't think that it's a mark against him to be worse than either of those guys when he's a really fucking good player. "
"If we're looking at the 2020 playoffs you need to start factoring in the ages of key players for both teams. Also, we need to assume Boogie will no longer be a Warrior since no matter how well he plays this year the most Golden State can offer him to re-sign next summer is only about $6 million per year. So here's the ages of the key players for Golden State:    Player | Age in 2020 playoffs ---|--- Kevin Durant | 31 Steph Curry | 32 Draymond Green | 30 Klay Thompson | 30 Andre Igoudala | 36 Shaun Livingston | 33 Jordan Bell | 25 Kevon Looney | 24  And here would be the ages of the key Lakers on this hypothetical team in the 2020 playoffs:  Player | Age in 2020 playoffs ---|--- LeBron James | 35 Kawhi Leonard | 28 Brandon Ingram | 22 Lonzo Ball | 22 Kyle Kuzma | 24 Josh Hart | 25 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope | 27 Svi Mykhailiuk | 23  Now while we can probably assume the Warriors Core 4 guys will still be in their prime and should be if not fully what they are now, pretty close, you have to wonder how much Igoudala and Shaun Livingston will be able to contribute by then, and those guys are key. Now for the Lakers if LeBron hits a wall due to age and his game falls off a cliff, then this is probably all academic, but it seems highly unlikely he's going to be too terribly worse than he is now. And virtually everyone else on the Lakers should be appreciably better in two years than they are now just due to getting closer to entering their primes. That series could be a lot more hotly contested than you're making it out to be."
"I don't wanna sound angry but why is the sidebar still Lebron James in a a Lakers jersey? It's been like this for two weeks.   At least put the Blazers summer league champions or something else. This is getting stale.  **Edit** - Our request has been answered, thank you Mods."
"wtf? are you seriously gonna have revisionist history? James was crucified for the decision because he teamed up with two all stars to build a superteam and ring chase. he was clowned, mocked and ridiculed for it...stars, former and current, were saying they wouldnt have done it..analysts said LeBron killed his legacy and could never be ranked above Jordan...it was a big fucking deal lol wtf you mean dude"
"&gt;endorsements  KD was getting big endorements in a smaller market than SA (OKC). Kawhi on the other hand wasn't as popular, because his personality doesn't sell. His STORY doesn't sell.  I'm not saying Kawhi will be begging for quarters in Skid row in 2 years. Only that his uncle wrecked his legacy, reputation, popularity, AND pocket for literally nothing. Kawhi ain't going to LA. His situation isn't better in TOR. If he only wanted to leave SA Kawhi could have just talked to Pop.  &gt;Winning does that.  True, winning can cover up faults and mistakes. But NBA careers/legacies/reputations isn't like photoshop with ctrl+z but painting a work of art. You can cover it up with new layer, but the paint is set. It's still there. And it's not just money.  KD's got 2 rings, but people still call him a snake and saying he's soft. He got 2 chips but people still debating if LBJ is up there with Jordan instead of asking if KD will catch MJ. People who debate on KD are asking if he's as good as LBJ at 33 or if he's even the best player/MVP of his own team. Even his own team's owner was roasting him.  Lebron left CLE as a FA and it seemed like the entire NBA world outside of Miami hated his ass. He goes back to CLE and breaks a 57 year drought (in ALL MAJOR SPORTS btw) coming back from 3-1 against the winningest regular season team of all time. And there are ***still*** people who hate his ass. Hell, there are Lakers fans that have him on their team right now that hate him. [They defaced that mural of him not that long ago.](https://hypebeast.com/2018/7/lebron-james-king-of-la-mural-vandalized)   "
?? Why is the entertainment LeBron James provides worth more then the entertainment The Rock provides. Both have to be in top physical shape and work long hard hours.   LeBron is just an athlete. He’s not the pope.
"Popovich might have had a good shot at Ted Cruz for his Senate seat. John Cornyn would be tougher but 2020 might be favorable. Greg Abbott is safe.  For the presidency, his politics don't work for Republicans, Democrats \*will\* care about a track record of some sort, and there's no path to winning the presidency as an independent.  However, I legitimately think he'd have a chance to win a statewide office as a Democrat, and the U.S. Senate would be a good place to do that. Al Franken and Bill Bradley are examples of people who made the jump straight to national politics and proved themselves.  Then again, I've said before that when he retires, LeBron James would make a good Ohio politician, and I think his intelligence, personal talent, and work ethic would serve him well in the Senate, too."
Only laker fans could get LeBron James and still be salty lol
LeBron James is Messi.  Stephen Curry is Pirlo.  Kyrie Irving is Salah.  Jayson Tatum is Mbappe.  Warriors are Manchester City.
Pop is on my 5 person list of people I'd like to have dinner with. He legit seems like a great human.  -  Gregg Popovich  -  Obama -  Joe Rogan -  Anthony Bourdain / (Gordon Ramsey) if we're limited to living people. -  Lebron James  Ernie Johnson is close at #6
"&gt; “But I have little doubt [Masai] Ujiri is willing to trade any Raptor on the roster if he finds a deal he likes — even after LeBron James’ departure to the Western Conference. The Raptors, I’m told, held exploratory discussions in the summer of 2017 with Minnesota on a deal that would have been headlined by DeRozan and the Timberwolves’ Canadian swingman Andrew Wiggins.”"
"And Lebron still thought they were a joke and was never worried when the series was tied 2-2; they won by 38 points the next game. ""I've been a part of some really adverse situations,” James said after putting up 23 points, eight assists, six rebounds and two steals, “and I just didn't believe that this was one of them."""
Teams with Lebron James are generally top 4 teams even if their regular season records don't indicate that. I expect the Lakers to make the WCF or the second round if they play the Warriors. 
"  It's not that Westbrook can make 19 mil in OKC. It's how much he can make Nike in LA or NY.   Why else would clauses like this exist?  &gt; Report: Tobias Harris won’t sign contract extension, would get Nike bonus by playing in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles   &gt;Lakers’ LeBron James’ first Nike deal promised to pay him more if he played in big market  Don't know why my comment isn't posting so I'm removing the links.  "

"I am aware it might benefit the team in the longrun, I never said that it wouldn't. That being said, it's not a guarantee on anything. DeMar was a guarantee, Kawhi is a gamble. Raps probably weren't winning with their core, but don't act like he didn't get done dirty with how they handled it. That is my point, teams can say shit just as much as players, but at the end of the day the player is always gonna get shit on. If the tables were turned and DeMar said he wanted to be here and then left in FA for San Antonio, people would have his head.  Reminds me of this article [posted here earlier this year](https://cassiuslife.com/46894/lebron-james-loyalty-blake-griffin/)   &gt;“When a player gets traded, it’s [the team] was doing what’s best for the franchise. But when a player decides to leave, it’s, ‘He’s not loyal. He’s a snake. He’s not committed.’ It’s just, that’s the narrative of how it goes. So I’m definitely [aware]. I know that firsthand,” James told Cleveland.com. "
lol who cares about regular season games? If the regular season was anywhere close to as indicative as the playoffs the Raptors and Houston would be playing in the finals and LeBron James wouldn't be considered the undisputed best player in the league.
"He was the first high school prospect to get the Sports Illustrated cover since Lebron James, I think that was a cocktail for this type of narrative he has for himself in regards to his defensive woes."
Miami - LeBron James    Fite me 
Lakers signed Lebron James. The best player in the world! You have the shittiest takes. 
"&gt; No PG signing No Kawhi signing (at least this year)  1/2 on signing FAs and the one we signed was Lebron James. I don't see how this is a bad thing. They lakers retained cap flexibility and signed the King for four years.   &gt; Lonzo won't be ready to play till the start of the season, no time to work on jump shot  [Wrong](https://twitter.com/Lakers/status/1019370113399545856) and wrong  &gt; Young team  Young talent on cheap contracts is what every team strives for.  &gt;Wouldn't be shocked to see a lot of analysts and reddit uses give the Lakers a pass even if they underperform and don't get out of the 1st or 2nd round.  What does underperform even mean for the Lakers?"
" Derozan averaged 26 points against the Wizards over 6 games. Yet, people say he didn't show up in the playoffs...he did. But when it mattered most he and Raptors let the mental block of LeBron James get in their head. He and his teammates did not perform well in that series. In previous years he has been underwhelming in the playoffs though. It is unfair to say someone didn't show up when they did for the first round. "
Lebron fucking James went?...
"If they start off looking disjointed like some other LeBron teams have done, I expect that some of their young guys will be involved in a trade by mid-season. That's usually good enough to get a James-led team to the playoffs."
"&gt;Too cheap   Bruh they wanted us to trade our entire fucking team for him. Just wasn’t worth it. If he comes next year good. If not, still got Lebron James. "
"Yeah I read what you wrote, it's a bunch of garbage. If you think Colangelo is better than Masai at any point in time, you're out of your mind.  Also, I never said Masai can do no wrong. In fact, I even stated one of his flaws off the top of my head. I'm just saying that I'd rather have Masai over Colangelo, because Masai actually knows what he's doing.  The Raptors were going nowhere with Boston, Philadelphia, etc. standing in the way in the absence of LeBron James. Have you watched those teams? They're younger and they're only going to get better and better, while Lowry and DeRozan continue to decline. Getting a top 5 player in return - this is the kind of risk you have to take to surpass the competition. Even if it's not the popular course of action."
"  &gt; The fuck? Draymond sets a moving screen and moves into James. LOOK. I think James grabs him just to hold his ground so Dray can't illegally move him.  THATS NOT A MOVING SCREEN, not even close.   Lebron grabbed Green as green maintained his screening position. You literally have no clue ho it works.  There’s was not even an INSTANT of Green moving until Lebron grabbed him. Holy fucking shit, this is literal proof you are too biased to have this conversation.    &gt; Hypocrite. Biased. Fuck outta here. They both chicken wing each other only difference is Dray does it first and when Lebron does it Dray flops.  No.  Once again, you literally need to watch the video. Lebron’s arms are ON green, proof?   :03 second, Lebron arms are on the chest of green, green knocks it away, Lebron flails his arm and knocks out Green.   Jesus Christ.  &gt; Dray got the flagrant cause he was going for someone's nuts again.  As Lebron knocked him down AND stepped over him as Green was getting up.   What a joke. Lol. You are the most biased user on this sub, as evidenced your awful defending of your god. "
The east was already fucked. Lebron James 6 (at the time) straight finals. You're not complaining about that are you? It was already not competitive. Only the West was competitive.
LeBron James tho
"Why are Lakers fans making self-righteous posts about their team in the midst of this trade?  Y'all just got LeBron James, you have 16 rings, why do you feel the need to make these posts lol"
"&gt; How in god’s name are you trying to argue what’s on the tape?  The fuck? Draymond sets a moving screen and moves into James. LOOK. I think James grabs him just to hold his ground so Dray can't illegally move him.  &gt;Green extension is not even CLOSE to anything harmful, Lebron extending his arms and knocking down green was absolutely a technical.  Hypocrite. Biased. Fuck outta here. They both chicken wing each other only difference is Dray does it first and when Lebron does it Dray flops.  Dray got the flagrant cause he was going for someone's nuts again. "
"Chris Paul re signed with a team that had a racist owner, KD and Kyrie want to play for a team owned by James Dolan, LeBron returned to a team that had a letter ripping him under team letterhead for 4 years, a team that had to verbally respond to boos in regards to a Monta Ellis trade shortly turned into the best dynasty of our time.  The point: this shit doesn’t matter and never has. "
"Nah, dude. Laker fans are SO salty. Every single one. It’s not like we got Lebron James. Remember they can’t go with the slant that “Lakers can’t sign anyone” so they focus on Paul George who clearly had his mind made up weeks ago and didn’t meet with any teams."
"The precedent is that you wont just struggle with no free agency signings, you'll struggle with keeping players in Toronto as well as keeping fans. You cant trade a guy that important to the franchise in a shitty way even if he had a bad playoffs, considering it was against LeBron fucking James."
"Lol chill man I'm not tryna get into an immature argument here. All I'm saying is the Lakers were clearly low-balling the Spurs, who in turn were clearly asking too much. Woj says [here](https://www.express.co.uk/sport/othersport/983902/Kawhi-Leonard-trade-Lakers-LA-LeBron-James-San-Antonio-Spurs-NBA-rumours-gossip-news) that "" The Lakers now, in the way they’ve approached these trade talks with San Antonio, they’re kind of showing their hand that they may be willing to just wait until next summer in free agency,”  and  “They have not made an overwhelming offer. I don’t think they’ve come close to meeting the threshold that the Spurs have.”  I don't think that at this point, we can say that the Lakers offered more than what the Spurs got today."
What the fuck? Y'all had a very good chance at making the finals last year if LeBron was in the West like he is now. You guys just had the best season in recent memory and y'all traded the face of the franchise after not moving on in the playoffs because you lost to fucking LeBron James for a one year rental coming off a serious and misleading injury. You could have easily  traded your younger core for another piece if you actually wanted to contend. 2 stars doesn't take you to the finals anymore and kawhi and Lowry won't be an exception.

You missed the bit where Raptors lead by 3-1 and became the second team ever to blow such lead in the NBA Finals. Both at the hands of LeBron James.
"Somewhere LeBron James is laughing “Come to Daddy, DeMar” "
"You bring up a good point with that, and as much as I'd like to use Jim Buss as the scapegoat, I'm going to fall back on my original point of not doing it to an all-NBA talent who spent almost an entire decade with us.  From that list, letting go of Randle is probably most relevant to our conversation but he said the day (I think it might have been hours) before being traded he said he didn't want to be with us.  edit: [Here's the source for Randle](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2018/7/1/17523810/nba-free-agent-rumors-julius-rande-la-lakers-magic-johnson-paul-george-lebron-james)"

Yeah but then PG would have been joining a young unproven squad. Kawhi would be joining Lebron James.
"Ok but he's choking against lebron James, the actual fucking GOAT... like damn"
Shaun Livingston is better than LeBron James because he is 3-1 against him in the finals
Russell Westbrook is better than LeBron James because he lead his team to the playoffs averaging a triple double in consecutive years while playing in the Western Conference.

"**Lebron signs to LA** flashes across DeMar's TV. &lt;br&gt; Tears stream down his face, as he goes to call his brother and teammate, Kyle Lowry. ""Bro, it's happening. We don't need to be scared anymore. Lebron's gone.""  *2 weeks later*  Lowry and DeMar sit down for a romantic candlelight dinner. DeMar gets up to update his comically large whiteboard that reads: ""Lebron free East for 15 Days"". A smile spreads across his face. Suddenly,his phone buzzes. It's Masai. ""Hey man what's up you coming to my Lebron left the East party next week? Celebrating our Finals appearance next year?"" ""Uh....about that....we're sending you to the Spurs for Kawhi."" The room starts to spin and DeMar shakes.  No matter how hard he tries, he can't escape the unbeatable deity that is Lebron James."
"This time a year ago:   &gt; Imagine trading your most loyal player, the face of the franchise, for a guy who refused to play with LeBron James.   &gt; Unbelievable.  I think this post will be one we will come back to a year from now and laugh at. Raptors have a great chance to improve from last year and also convince Kawhi to stay. "
KD is better than LeBron James. If you want proof go watch the playoffs and pays attention when they play on the road you will see Steph numbers compare to KD.
"HAHAHAHAHAH they only got LeBron James as a consolation prize, too HAHAHAHAHAH"
&gt;LeBron James likes it here too!”  Lmao  Kawhi finally got his wish and got traded to LeBron's team
Named LeBron James ~by LeBron James
We add LeBron James to our roster and you don’t think we’re focusing on the playoffs?
LeBron James is never going to make the finals again. He'll be lucky to make WCF.   I'll donate $500 to a children's hospital if he ever makes the finals while playing for the Lakers.
"They played it smart. If Kawhi comes next year, great! You’re adding him to a core with Lonzo, Hart, Ingram, Kuzma, Lebron and the draft picks this year. If he doesn’t come, there’s room to sign one of the other max FA who I’m fairly comfortable saying will be attracted to playing in LA with Lebron James...  If they hadn’t been “too cheap” as you say, the team would have been just Lebron and Kawhi and maybe Lonzo + fillers. That’s likely not enough to beat the Warriors, particularly this year. You’re asking them to give up assets to get Kawhi now so that they can ostensibly finish with a better record this year (which I’m not even sure would have been the case, depending on how many pieces they gave up); all that really matters is a title.   It’s the classic experiment of telling the subject they can have $50 now or $100 in a year. People don’t want to be patient, but it makes sense for the Lakers when $50 likely isn’t buying them a title this year. "
Sorry wrong thread.

I can just picture Raps front office trying to sell him the Toronto dream.    “Look Kawhi we know you wanted to be in LA but Toronto is kind of like LA in certain ways.  1. We make movies here too and the industry is growing a lot! We even have a nice film festival every year! 2. Our traffic is just as bad if not worse than LA’s! 3. Toronto is beside a lake. That’s kinda like the ocean!  4. LeBron James likes it here too!”

"Haha what a bunch of bozos, they couldn't even beat Lebron James! Everyone else in the east has been sweeping Lebron for years besides Toronto."
"yeah that ""LeBron James included"" fact actually makes it harder to get a better deal from Nike"
LA is close to his home. LA is a bigger market with LeBron James included and a young core that with Kawhi could compete for titles. Kawhi has the potential to make more in LA to make up his money is all I'm saying. 
The three seed with fucking LEBRON JAMES. 
"The reason the Spurs will likely come out ahead is because they don't NEED to do anything. People like that are a nightmare to negotiate against. Pop's knows he won't be fired, the executive team knows they won't be fired, so they can sit back and wait for a desperate GM to mortgage their future in a bid to save their job.  I also don't know if Kawhi is realistically a top 5 player anymore. A lot of people say he is top five, but LeBron, Curry, AD, Giannas, Durant, and James Harden already round out the top 6. Then we have Embiid, Mitchell, Simmons, Irving, KAT, and Westbrook competing for the top 10 spots depending on how they develop. "
"Lmao you make it sound like a bad thing, the way we see it is... we got Lebron fucking James , nailed the draft picks again, and get to keep our core and get Kawhi for free next summer. "
"Fresh off his 4th title,Lebron James is pretty pumped to team up with KD :/"
"""I'm gonna be honest with you Kawhi, you're fucking crazy.  You let the worst agent in NBA history and your idiot uncle ruin your reputation and you should really think about staying in Toronto.  The fans will love you forever.  I know you're from CA but you're emotionally fragile and are going to get eaten alive in LA and the pressure playing on a Lebron James team."""
"You calling me angry is just projection on your part. If it's just meaningless internet points, then why the downvotes? Obviously they mean more to you than me; I'm just pointing that out.  Again, Cris Carter is lying about what Kawhi told him? Jordan Schultz is lying about what Kawhi told him? As for the contradictory reports, the only reports you can believe are from people who actually spoke to him. As far as I can tell, that's Cris Carter and Jordan Schultz. They both say the same thing: Kawhi wants to go to LA; Kawhi doesn't want to be a rental; Kawhi wants to play with LeBron James.  The faster you accept these facts, the better it will be for you.  Edit: Like, bro, just admit you're wrong and move on."
Why not add a player of Kawhi's caliber and try for your franchise's first ever finals appearance now that LeBron James is out of your conference first?
"Maybe because that guy is a 2X DPOY, FMVP, all-nba top 5 in the league superstar? While DeRozan, loyal and nice as he is, isn't half the player Kawhi is?????  Maybe Masai realizes that AND sees the ridiculous sum of money Demar will be commanding for multiple years and sees a risk worth taking in a conference that no longer houses LeBron James..."

Lebron James is basically the league dad at this point.
"Overheard in Wall family living room circa 2009: ""he knows me"", Wall said, after Lebron visited his family and left with a knowing smile. ""That fucking James knows me."" Wall added ""he's so good"", repeating it four times. He then said he wanted to add Lebron to the list of people who know him."
"Lebron James is the nba's role model player. He donates millions to charity. starts his own school, and is a great player. Trump shouldn't insult a man that is so good at his craft he should be considered a demigod."
Man... We got LeBron James....
"&gt;Probably should have used one of his 2011 Mavs games then    Yes, you probably should have, just like rest of the autistic haters that's stuck in 2011, kind of like the *sunken place*.. Other than that, there's literally nothing else for y'all haters  &gt;   This is not just any other all star or superstar. This is LeBron James. The man literally averaged 35-7-5 at age 20 in his first ever playoff series, and at age 21, he carried a team full of trash to the NBA Finals..   &gt;   Aren't you a Raptors fan? Didn't your team get swept back to back by this man? He literally owns the whole city of Toronto. Raptors were the number 1 seed this year, best record ever, deep as fuck team, had home court, and had more rest, while this was the worst Cavs team LeBron had since that 2006/07 roster, they also were tired after playing a 7 game series against Indiana, and also had a short rest time.. And yet, LeBron came in y'all building, and obliterated the fuck out of that pathetic franchise again, with fadeaways after fadeaways.. after fadeaways..   &gt;   Y'all kids are extremely delusional, and lack basic self awareness. Crawl back to ya hole, and shut the hell up. Show some fucking respect to the owner and father of Toronto, and your favorite team. Don't trip boy "
"Yet they never talk about him in goat conversation which is ridiculous.  9 NBA finals in 11 years with a 5-4 record.  I'm sorry, but he's clearly ahead of Lebron James."
It was the [top player from each conference](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/18/cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-named) - I assumed it was the top 2 players overall. I guess we'll see Team Giannis/Kawhi/Embiid/Kyrie against Team LeBron.

"&gt; then why do you keep arguing with me about Jordan's worldwide brand?  Because it's franchise/city, not just the fans in the city alone. There are Bulls fans outside of Chicago because of MJ. It really isn't difficult to understand.  &gt;  MJ is NOT known as a god worldwide, like how Lebron is a god in Cleveland  And when LeBron retires guess how much you see of him? People wear Jordan's everywhere. If that's not demigod status, I don't know what is.  &gt; t's known for the Bean/river/deep dish pizza etc, it's a tourist spot.  Irrelevant since it's about the Bulls, not Chicago.  &gt; Whereas Cleveland has absolutely NOTHING, except for Lebron James.  Lmao, how much are you being paid or are you just this stuck wherever you are that you don't know the world?"
"then why do you keep arguing with me about Jordan's worldwide brand? YES the Bulls are known because of Jordan, and YES the Jordan brand is worldwide and YES they are correlated, BUT the Bulls are NOT known internationally as Jordan's team NOW. They are known as the Chicago Bulls. If you walk around ANY parts of Asia (specifically China), you will see TONS of Derrick Rose jersey and billboards, and barely any MJ ones. MJ is NOT known as a god worldwide, like how Lebron is a god in Cleveland. And hearing you talk about Jordan's worldwide impact makes me think you've havent been international at all. Not even mentioning the city of Chicago, it's known for the Bean/river/deep dish pizza etc, it's a tourist spot.    Whereas Cleveland has absolutely NOTHING, except for Lebron James. "
He was also guarding lebron in the mickey D game and made to look like a child when guarding James.  I thought Beasley would be a perennial all star.

LeBron James is black
This is the first nice thing I've seen Stephen Curry say about LeBron James.
Read the article. It's about how what you said really only applies to the NFL. [Protests in recent years by players in the NBA has never negatively affected the NBA](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12001456/lebron-james-kyrie-irving-cleveland-cavaliers-kevin-garnett-deron-williams-brooklyn-nets-wear-breathe-shirt-reference-eric-garner).
"So I met LeBron 4 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in but fucking LeBron James himself.  I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother him, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So LeBron put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it. Would let him breast feed my niece again."
"They’re already in that mentality. At a bar with a friend of mine who doesn’t watch basketball. It was during the Finals. He turns to me and says, “I fucking hate LeBron James.”  And starts prattling on about rich athletes blah blah blah"
If bron decided he wanted to get into politics and held some lower positions first before running that would be one thing but electing him just because he’s lebron James would be stupid and show that we haven’t learned anything 
"“Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon, he made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do.”   -The President of the United States"
"You can't compare to Lonzo, Rubio, Clarkson, Lee, and the rest of these guys because of volume. Lebron shoots way more than any of these guys. You can't use attempts per game to account for volume because those guys still don't shoot as much as Lebron or play as many games as Lebron. For example, McConnell only made attempted 102 mid-range shots last year. Lebron attempted 3x as much at 301. You have to compare to other stars or players with that sample size.  So, is James Harden a good shooter from mid-range since he 'only' shoots from 43%. Paul George shot 35% from 10-16 feet. What about Donovan Mitchell at 37%?"
Kobe Bryant would have to be considered  top 5 all-time.  1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Magic Johnson
This entire sub has been a LeBron James Appreciation Thread for a while 
" Statement to USA TODAY Sports from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who is in Johannesburg, South Africa for the third NBA Africa Game (in partnership with the Nelson Mandela Foundation), in response to President Trump’s tweet about LeBron James and CNN’s Don Lemon  &gt;""LeBron is one of the all-time greatest NBA players and one of the most accomplished athletes. He runs a very successful media company. He's sent hundreds of students to college and just opened a school in Akron where at-risk students will receive free tuition, meals and transportation. I greatly admire his intelligence and business acumen and have enormous respect and appreciation for what he does in his community."""
man some of the ignorance here is annoying  think lebron is the goat if u want  think mj is the goat if u want  but saying that lebron james has no argument for it is fucking stupid and narrow minded.
Between arguably the best ever mid-range shooter and Lebron. It's notable sure but it also means Lebron is good mid-range shooter. Lebron went up to 43% in the playoffs this year.  Donovan Mitchell shot 37% from 10-16 feet is he a mid-range good shooter? James Harden shot 43% is he any good? Lebron is elite at 42%.
"You know, it's always smart to back up your own statements on this site with some actual evidence. You're essentially saying that Jordan never donates to charities or causes while LBJ is the polar opposite. Actual evidence suggests otherwise. Jordan donates to [25 charities and causes](https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/michael-jordan) compared to LeBron who donates to [18](https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/lebron-james). Jordan [recently donated](https://www.looktothestars.org/news/17190-novant-health-receives-7-million-gift-from-michael-jordan) $7m to his own Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte.       They're both as philanthropic as each other, it isn't a competition, it's not going to affect the GOAT argument in any way. Don't sweat it..."
Lebron James 
"What? Currently, the top two posts on r/The_Donald in the last 24 hours are both about the Lebron James tweet. Both of these posts were listed several hours before your comment as well.   1) The top post is literally a link to the tweet  2) The second top post is a gif of donald trump throwing a basketball at Lebron James face  The comment section seems just as cancerous as the other guy stated as all the top comments are openly endorsing Trump's behavior.  I don't understand how you came to any of your conclusions especially considering you claim not be a Trump supporter."
&gt; LeBron James' eyes soften as he tries to swallow a knowing smile  that description though
"Speaking to his mixed-race ~~girlfriend~~ wife, ~~Sterling~~ Trump said, ""It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with ~~black people~~ LeBron James."" And also, ""I'm just saying, in your lousy f******* ~~Instagram~~ fashion, you don't have to have yourself with, walking with black people."" And also, ""You can sleep with ~~[black people]~~ LeBron. You can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is not to promote ~~(black people)~~ LJ on that ... and not to bring them to my political rallies."""
"&gt; LeBron and Steph have better things to do than start shit with trump.   https://deadline.com/2018/06/donald-trump-nba-champions-no-white-house-invite-warriors-cavaliers-1202406332/  Before the invites were even sent out, and before Trump even tweeted anything, before the fucking championship series was even completed:  - *“I know no matter who wins this series, no one wants an invite anyway — it won’t be Cleveland or Golden State going,”* James said Tuesday.  Then Trump tweeted the un-invite.  After that, Curry and LeBron had a circle jerk on twitter.  Then, after the victory, trump tweet un-inviting them, and following the circlejerk on twitter, the GSW did a press release and backhandedly threw some shade at Trump:   They said that when they go to Washington this season they will instead *""celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion - the values that we embrace as an organization.""*  http://www.nba.com/article/2017/09/23/statement-golden-state-warriors  It's not revisionist history. It all started when lebron open his mouth to reporters after game three."
"Minor point but imma nitpick. Article says that ""In September 2017, James called Trump a 'bum' for rescinding his invitation to the Golden State Warriors to celebrate their basketball championship with a visit to the White House.""   In Lebron's famous ""u bum"" tweet, he didn't call Trump a bum for rescinding the invitation but rather for rescinding the invitation despite Curry already saying he wouldn't go (a ""no *I'm* breaking up with you"" situation).    To me the latter scenario which Lebron was actually talking about is more bumworthy than just Trump uninviting Curry. "
LeBron James with Wilt Chamberlain-like stamina  or  Michael Jordan with Stephen Curry range
Is Lebron James wealthier than Donald Trump?
1. I thought Speedy Claxton is the next AI.  2. I thought Lebron James would fall out of first team all nba by the time he’s 30.
"LeBron recently opened a school for under privileged kids in Ohio, I think in Akron, and went on CNN with Don Lemon to promote it. Trump, who doesn't watch CNN, then tweeted: ""Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn't easy to do."""

"Curry just called LeBron ""King James"".  LeBron &gt; Curry, even Curry knows this now."
And why should he even mention Trump’s name?   I’m reading all these responses and some of you guys are completely missing the mark. No one should be talking about Trump rn. We should be talking about the fact that Lebron James just opened up a freaking public school and is inspiring millions of people.  Once you mention Trump’s name HE becomes the story (which is what he wants) and it turns into an ugly mess that detracts from what Lebron just did. Silver is taking the 100% correct response and I like that Lebron himself hasn’t said a word about this - the roar of public opinion is already speaking for him
"&gt; That to me among makes Kobe Bryant a better playoff performer than LeBron James.  That was meant to say, ""that to me among (other things) makes Kobe Bryant a better playoff performer than LeBron James.""   &gt;You said nothing about Kobe being a cornerstone in that statement.  On a NBA forum, I didn't think I had to. If you know who Kobe Bryant is, you already know that he was a cornerstone player on 5 NBA championships. And I certainly hope that I don't have to explain the difference between Derek Fisher and Kobe Bryant. That should be self explanatory. "
"Please down vote me if you don't agree but the president picking on Lebron James is unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Lebron and Don Lemon's feelings will survive.  I don't care how stupid or racist Trump's tweets are towards well respected public figures, they are just a distraction.  Our president is a pawn of Russia and is working towards breaking up one of the most powerful and important alliances (US/Europe) ever. We elected Obama who was denied his constitutional duty to appoint someone to the SCOTUS. This appointment will now be stolen by Trump who has an ongoing investigation that has the potential of yielding evidence of treason and has thus far churned up indictments and guilty pleas. It's important for people like MJ, LBJ, and CC to stand together but I wish we could see past the short outbursts and use them as an excuse to call out things like election hacking, SCOTUS appointment, Helsinki betrayal, and attempts at breaking up NATO which will have generational impact. The news is so chaotic but we cannot get lost dwelling on things like this when there are some seriously terrifying things going on in the world. I thought [Steve Schmidt's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNgkpb-rrMc) commentary on RTWBM last night was particularly disturbing. "

"I mean when you change your argument in the middle, that shows that you realized how flawed your logic is. Here’s what you said initially:  &gt;	Kobe has won more championships, has lost less in the Finals while having less Finals appearances. That to me among makes Kobe Bryant a better playoff performer than LeBron James.  Now let’s replace Kobe with Derek Fisher. The statement still holds true.  &gt;	Fisher has won more championships, has lost less in the Finals while having less Finals appearances. **That to me** among makes  Fisher a better playoff performer than LeBron James.  You said nothing about Kobe being a cornerstone in that statement. You literally said those finals championships and losses are what determines kobe being better than LeBron for you. “**THAT to me**”. You gotta remember what you write. If you want to back track and change up your argument, that’s fine, but in any event, your logic and reasoning is still flawed. "
Fuck Lebron James
I pray to God Lebron James isn’t the president one day. I’m a huge fan and I think he’s a great guy but god please no. 
"It’s funny because of the timing on this. There is not any realistic way that you can address what Lebron James is doing right now for kids in Akron as anything but caring, positive and selfless. And yet now of course Trump is the one guy who finds a reason to put him in a negative light. It’s baffling really, as just about any time would be more logical and understanding to feel the need to speak out negatively on Lebron James (not that he necessarily should be in the first place)."

"&gt;LeBron is a choker, but you of course don't apply the same (totally unbiased) standards to anyone else.  Oh that's just not accurate, sir.

"Firstly, its unfair to compare per game averages for a player who hasn't hit his decline yet. But even with that advantage: Jordan, KAJ, Barkley, Wilt, Oscar, Jerry West, Magic, Larry, Malone, Shaq have unequivocally had more successful offensive careers.   That's just retired players: Lebron, Dirk, Durant, Steph, Chris Paul currently have all had better offensive careers than James Harden.  And I was being kind only considering regular season numbers. When the real stuff starts James Harden shoots 42/32/87 and is 39th all time in PPG, compared to 25 in the RS. Top 10 offensive player of all time my ass. He's only ever been the best on his own team 5/9 years.  I'm super curious what the argument for him could possibly be."
"In my opinion, once we start censoring ourselves in order to prevent TD posters from throwing a hissy fit, then we've basically let them win. it would be far more productive to allow users to discuss the news while letting the downvote button do it's intended job for once instead of just being the ""I disagree"" button. The fact that on probably the biggest NBA forum in the world we're not allowed to comment on a sitting President directly attacking the biggest star in the league, an unprecedented event, is ridiculous.  also in case you didn't notice, the LeBron James appreciation thread along with several other on the news are full of gross/disrespectful comments, the very ones that you're worried about preventing. And guess what? nobody can see them unless they scroll to the bottom of the thread because they've all been downvoted to hell."

He also seems to share typical democrat New York ideals on gun control).   r/nba go easy on republicans. It’s not you vs us, it’s us all vs the problems in this country. There are so many things we can agree on and get accomplished.   And that’s why trumps comment pissed me off. Why the fuck would you attack LeBron James who has only ever helped people. Seriously, the whole conservative approach is supposed to be charity for those in need instead of forcibly using tax dollars. Guess who just put hundreds of kids through fucking college?   "

Lebron James is a high IQ individual 
I define it as being the most impact and best player in the league. Take Lebron off of the Cavs and they're a lottery team. That''s the impact he has on NBA teams. Also the MVP is meaningless. No one thinks James Harden is the best player in the world or even in Lebron's league. They give these guys MVP because they can't give it to Lebron every year.
"I just feel that this entire sub is a too quick to throw the word racist around.  Yes, Lebron James is black.  But calling Lebron stupid does not make you a racist."

"You are being technical. You know that OP meant LeBron James can not be President today if he wanted to be. You’re ignoring that most people mean “run for President” synonymously as they mean “being President” to make a point, while calling people ignorant for doing so."
"Let's be honest, the only people that would think it's okay for Trump to say this are racists. Whether they will publicly admit it or not, that's what they are. Also, if Trump had any fucking clue how to be president, he would've been praising James for what he did for those kids. Regardless of Lebron disagreed with how he's handling his presidency. Instead, he proved yet again how small and fragile his ego is. The sane and normal people in this country will rejoice when this fucking loser is gone."
I appreciate LeBron James
"It's almost like LeBron James is a (vastly, imo) superior basketball player to Kobe Bryant."
"Jordan is smart enough not to offend either side (gotta sell shoes to people of both parties and lives ~~in SC~~ around the Carolinas).

Honestly it takes one great player kicking something off to inspire other players to do the same. Idk how many of you in this sub follow soccer but Juan Mata's Common Goal program is a great example of this. But Mata is nowhere near LeBron James level. Reasonable to think LeBron's foray into education charity could spur a movement from the rest of US athletes on a scale even he couldn't imagine.

If a two game swing isn't worth discussing, then we shouldn't really ever discuss role players.   If a random role player got injured and produced *nothing* for the team, it would probably only cost that team a few games in total. Similarly, any roster move involving role players probably will only shift a team's win total by a few games at most. If a 2 game swing by a role player improving their shot isn't worth discussing, we should basically never discuss role players, and instead just focus on superstars.  The reason it matters is that the NBA doesn't just change by the dramatic shifts worth 10+ games (Lebron going to LA, etc). Most of the time, when a team improves or worsens, it's because of the culmination of a series of small shifts like this, for worse or better."
"Former Knicks fan: “Hello, sharks.

Did I mention that I was an early investor in Uber? I’m out.”  Daymond: “As a Knicks fan, I’m insulted that you would sell your fandom like this. There are thousands of people that would kill to be Knicks fans and you treat it as a hobby. You’re an embarrassment to this city and this fan base, and I’m done talking to you.”  Kevin: “Daymond, tell us how you really feel. Does that mean you’re out?”  Daymond: “I’m out.”  Barbara: “Why did you come here? You’re upset. You’re disappointed. You feel betrayed by James Dolan. I get it, but I don’t think you have enough confidence in yourself for this to work. I’m out.”  Mark: “I don’t want your fandom. I want you. I’m looking for an acquihire. Do you know what that is? It’s when someone buys a company (or in this case, a fan), because they like the talent, not necessarily the idea. I want to buy you for $5,000. I’ll pay for your housing, meals, and other miscellaneous goods. I need you to attend every game, and be my designated driver, among other things.”  Kevin: “I don’t care much about sports. Root for whichever team you’d like. It doesn’t even have to be an NBA team. I’ll give you your $1,973 in exchange for royalties. I want $10 for every promotional item you receive, until I make my money back. Then I want $5 in perpetuity. This promotional item could be a t-shirt, a bobble head, a foam finger, a schedule magnet for your refrigerator. That’s all I ask for. Mark wants you to sell your soul. I just want a small cut.”  Robert: “What’s it gonna be? Mark wants to buy your entire existence. Kevin wants a cut of the goods.”  Kevin: “Time’s up. You’ve gotta make a decision. Me or Mark?”  Former Knicks fan: “I just can’t compel myself to care about the Mavericks. I think Doncic is gonna be a bust. I also think Dirk is a little overrated.”  Mark: “You’re arrogance will be your downfall. I offered you the deal of a lifetime and you spat in my face. For those reasons, I’m out.”  Kevin: “It looks like I’m all that’s left. James Dolan has what... another 40 years left in his life? Maybe 50? Do you really want to subject yourself to that. Come with me, and you’ll see what other franchises have to offer.”  Former Knicks fan: “I’m just... Kevin Knox looked great in Summer League and Porzingis will be back in February. LeBron is gone and we have a real shot to get the 8th seed in the East.”  Robert: “You don’t want to sell you’re fandom, do you? You’ve invested so much time and energy into this that you fear you’ll regret giving up now. You’re a Knicks fan through and through.”  Kevin: “You’re dead to me.

"I dunno, I think there are a lot of factors that go into the Cavs decisions.  First, just how good or bad is the team without Lebron James? I know Lebron is a great player, and he carried that team last year, but I am eager to see how they play when they are running plays in which Kevin Love is the first option or I would like to see a lot more floor movement.  Second, just what was the market like for Kevin Love? If they wanted to go full rebuild, they would have traded Love for more picks. But if there was no one biting, or at least they were pretty unhappy with the offers, then there is no reason to force a trade."

"LeBron James is 6-26 (19%) when guarded by Steph Curry in the NBA Finals over the past 4 seasons. (via @ESPNStatsInfo)  According to NBA Advanced Stats, Curry played 13 defensive possessions against Harden. In those 13 possessions, Curry held Harden to 2-of-6 shooting from the field (33.3 percent) and 1-of-2 shooting from behind the arc (50.0 percent)."
"I should have clarified, I meant it as a Kobe fan not having him ranked higher than Lebron James, I live in LA with these idiots so that's what I was referring to. I'm right there with you in his REAL ranking."
"I'd certainly say Stockton was as skilled, if not more so, than Curry in a different way.  Curry's skill set is ideal for the modern NBA, but Stockton could have retired SIX YEARS earlier and still be the Assist Leader. Add on his ability to be an All Defense player and he's skilled.  Achievements. no, but pure skill?  Right now, Curry's records seem insane, but in 1995 the concept of Kevin Durant was insane, LeBron James was a thing of Science Fiction. And young kids are shooting more and more 3's, it went from a niche part of the game in the 90s to a primary offensive thing. It's not unreasonable to think that Curry's records won't be as dominant in fifteen years."

"You're missing my point.  LeBron James has flaws.  James Harden has flaws. Russell Westbrook has flaws.  Draymond Green has flaws. Giannis Antetokounmpo has flaws.  It's not always about who has the least weaknesses, but who has the greatest strengths and can be more impactful overall."
"Tough to say. As the narrative always goes, if you change one part of that Pistons season, you never know what else changes too. If Bosh showed promise that year, maybe it convinces Joe Dumars to *not* go out and get Rasheed Wallace, which would benefit Bosh long term but might cost the Pistons that 2004 ring in the short term.   For the sake of discussion though, if *everything* stayed the same except for swapping Darko for Bosh, it would have been awfully nice to have a guy like Bosh on hand to fill Ben Wallace's role after Wallace signed with Chicago in '06. At that point, perhaps Bosh's presence would have been enough to limit LeBron James to 46 points instead of 48 in the 2007 playoffs, which maybe swings the series in the Pistons' favor, which then sends them to another winnable championship series against the Spurs.

"&gt;You're free to think it's silly, but do you have any evidence to support the Lakers turning him down? This is the first in hearing of it.   Yes. Here's [SI reporting it](http://amp.si.com/nba/2018/07/03/demarcus-cousins-lakers-warriors-lebron-james) and here is [Bleacher Report](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2784419-lakers-rumors-los-angeles-turned-down-chance-to-sign-demarcus-cousins.amp.html) saying the same.   &gt;You really think that there is a single front office that would say no thanks to a one year $5 million deal with the best center(pre-injury) in the league?  Yes, per Zach Lowe on his podcast, there's actually several NBA front offices with a ""no cousins"" rule. They just flat out wouldnt want cousins on their team apparently.   You're also forgetting the injury. Not many teams wanted to risk it. Cousins wont be back til Jan or Feb at least. And there's no guarantee he'd be good considering its the worst injury an athlete can sustain in terms of returning to form.  &gt;that's almost no risk, for possibly huge payoff  The risk is a roster spot, tax payments, locker room drama etc there's always risk.   &gt;Even if you didn't want him, the possibility of him gaining a fraction of his trade value back is reason enough  He wouldn't be back to form before the trade deadline. Not really any chance of him being traded anywhere.   &gt;The idea that GS was the only team willing to sign him for the veterans minimum is extremely suspect.  He didn't sign for the minimum.    &gt;there are players still looking for a contract right now that will likely sign for more money in the near future  Uhhhh...no there isn't. The only players who can get more than what he got are going to resign with their own team. no one's getting more than the MLE anymore as a free agent.    &gt;He said himself that the warriors were the first and only team he contacted.  Where did he say that?"

"That's not 100% true. Most people were amazed by the Warriors building a championship team, and a lot of people were still readily hating on LeBron for seemingly ring chasing (first joined the Heat in 2011, then left them to come back to a better Cavaliers team when it became clear the Bosh-Wade-James trio wasn't going to be elite anymore)."
Only other players who I’ve seen consistently lifting off that early are LeBron James and Derrick Rose. Idk what that means but I can’t think of anyone else even close.
What? where are you looking?

"&gt;Lonzo's coach is lavar,Magic(remember DLO) and lebron so 15 years later who is going to be a greater career  This is a terrible statement, outside of maybe the Lavar part. First of all, Magic had nothing to do with DLO's fuck up as a Laker, he traded him in the first off season he took over. Magic Johnson, the greatest point guard ever, has been watching film with Lonzo weekly. How can you twist that into something negative for Lonzo? DLO never took the time to do that.  In addition to that, Luke Walton has been a great mentor and coach so far, who you didn't even mention. And Lebron James playstyle is perfect to teach Lonzo (and no, I'm not comparing them one fucking bit). "

"That draft choice originally belonged to the Grizzlies and was No. 1 protected at that point. So the Pistons never would have had a chance at LeBron James. The best case scenario for Detroit, at that time, was the No. 2 selection. Any higher and the pick would have gone back to the Grizzlies."

"Played and started in high school in California averaged 14pts. Played against Baron Davis and Tyson Chandler in state playoffs.   Was a bench warmer in junior college played against zones or blowouts because of my shooting so not every game averaged like 3pts , but did hit game winner at buzzer final game of year to help my team win league for first time in 25 years. Played against Jamaal Tinsley in junior college.  Coached junior college as an assistant for 6 years one of those years served as interim head coach won league twice, made Elite 8 once and Final 4 once. Coached against Dwayne Dedmon, Desimond Penigar and coached James Ennis.   Was a Varsity high school head coach for 7 years made playoffs 5 of those years. Didn't ever coach against NBA players, but were in same tournaments and saw James Harden, Lebron James, Sebastian Telfair, Demar Derozan, Jrue Holiday, Lonzo Ball, Marvin Bagley play in high school.   Went to China for a month to do coaches clinics, elite youth camps, and exhibition games against Chinese U15, U16 teams with Evan Mobley #1 player in class of 2020 and. #25 Johnny Juzuang in 2020. Horace Grant was the NBA Ambassador with us on trip.  Got to go and assist and watch NBA/draft offseason training for a summer and see Jay Williams, Dahntay Jones, Joe Forte, and Kevin Love."
"You did need a replacement for JR who missed half the season with injury and it's never a bad idea to add one of the best shooters in NBA history to LeBron James who thrives with the floor spread. Cavs went on to post one of the greatest offensive ratings in NBA postseason history and were especially ridiculous with Korver on the court flanking James. Not Griffins fault the Warriors signed KD and broke the balance of the rivalry.  I do agree the Cavs could have used a reliable 3&amp;D wing more so than Korver, but I don't know who that would have really been. Those types of players are hard to find on the open market.   Agreed on Mozgov."
Imagine being embarrassed to be the child of LeBron James. He could walk me into school in a God damn prom dress and he would still be the coolest parent there ten thousand times over.
It’s pretty easy to put up with your Dads shenanigans when your dad is Lebron fucking James. 
Of course it's a case-to-case basis.  Take for example a guy like LeBron James who pays attention to his diet/nutrition/health. 
"There's nothing for Randle to do in a LeBron James led-offense. Either he sets a screen every single play (which he's not great at), or he's an active detriment to the offense. He's basically useless unless he's involved in the primary action. He and LeBron are more redundant than Ball and Rondo are.   Defensively Randle would be a nice fit though. "
Lebron james played with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh
"Yeah and that someone else is a dumbass because they missed LeBron James, who, last I checked, isn’t a point guard and is a better passer than Jokic by far. As far as other centers who could match Jokic’s offensive skill set (which is ignoring his defensive woes), Arvydas Sabonis and Vlade Divac come to mind. So I don’t see how he’s really that special of a player. Sure, he’s a good passer and has high b-ball IQ, but his defense and lack of athleticism keep him in my opinion from being a top 5 center in the NBA."

"1. LeBron James - if LA can get a top 4 seed and he does what he did last year that will probably be enough  2. Kawhi Leonard - if fully healthy he’s in a great situation and TOR will almost certainly be a top 2 seed. Pundits are enamored by his two-way ability  3. James Harden - if HOU has the best record again he’s an obvious contender  4. Steph Curry - Durant would have to miss significant time for this to be realistic, but the Warriors have the potential to win around 70 games  5. Giannis Antetokounmpo - if MIL makes the jump to contender he would be a legit candidate, although I doubt they do. Same can be said for Anthony Davis but he faces even tougher odds in the West"

The state that produces the second most is Ohio which is home to the Cleveland Cavaliers who, by no coincidence, won a championship in 2016 when this egg data was collected. Clearly, Kawhi Leonard is interested in signing with the Cleveland Cavaliers to form a duo with rookie Collin Sexton and prepare him for the inevitable return of LeBron James in 2022, along with the arrival of his son, LeBron ""Bronny"" James Jr., to pursue the final championship run of LeBron Sr.'s career and set in stone his name as the GOAT NBA player."

"credit: /u/lolathon234  KD would probably be on his way to challenging Jordan as the best player ever. Not that he's better than Jordan, but that would be the narrative.  He would be the youngest MVP ever at 21 years old. He also would have 4 total MVP's by 25 years old, nobody else had more than 2.  He wins a title/ FMVP at 23 years old and he would have done it for a franchise that was 4 years old. He wouldn't have joined a juggernaut like Magic or Bird or had a veteran sidekick with title experience, Wade. He wouldn't have had to endure a decade of struggling like Jordan or LeBron. He basically would have come in the league and taken it by storm. And OKC never trades Harden since they win the championship. The OKC trio goes on to become a dynasty, led by Durant. Westbrook and Harden are never shown to be MVP level players because they play 2nd fiddle behind KD, who gets the bulk of the credit.  He also becomes the best player in the world at 23 years old and likely never forfeits it, particularly given the 2016 choke job never happens with Harden on the roster.  Additionally, he would be the phenom that came in and took the league by storm as a 19 year old, not LeBron. He would be the one that was the youngest to X scoring numbers and the one that was the ""chosen one"". And he is never criticized for not being an elite playmaker since there is no LeBron to compare him to. And all of his young pre-prime seasons get FAR more credit/praise since he's not being compared to peak/prime LeBron James.  Durant at 29 would probably have 4 MVP's 4-6 titles(2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, and maybe 2014/2015) 3-5 FMVP's 4 scoring titles  At the same age Jordan had 2 MVP's 1 title 1 FMVP 6 scoring titles  What would even be the argument against Durant being the GOAT if the above happened? Competition? People could just say Durant was simply better than everyone else aka the GOAT. There is no all around argument w/o LeBron. There's no snaking or ring chasing or choking. There's no he's not clutch/can't shoot. There's no stacked team argument since it would have been 100% homegrown and Durant would have been the seed. The headcoach and entire roster sans Nick Collison were gone by his 3rd season, he was all that was left. He would have had no veteran leadership to show him the way, he would have done it on his own. And he would have done it in a city that had 0 history of professional sports. Durant would have started a dynasty from scratch. Additionally he would have gone right through Kobe, Dirk, and Duncan on the way to his 1st title. In 2012 OKC beat the Mavs who were the champs, the Lakers who were the 2009 &amp; 2010 champs, and the Spurs. That would have been 1 hell of a title run for a 23 year old going through 2 top 10 and another top ~25 player all time who were all still playing at a level near their prime."

"Magic and Bird is the GOAT rivalry. Multiple finals, multiple MVPs, conference vs. conference, Celtics vs. Lakers, supporting stars all over.  There were a lot of other recent ones shaping up, but they mostly disappeared - Warriors vs.Thunder, LeBron vs. Durant, Curry/Thompson/Green vs. James/Irving/Love, Celtics/Wizards, to name a few.  I think some matchups don't quite become rivalries just because of the type of match-up. For instance, Warriors 3 vs. Bron worked well because they roughly correlated - 1 MVP and 2 supporting All-Stars, 1 PG, 1 wing, 1 PF. Similar deal with the Big 3 Celtics vs. the Heatles - SG, SF, PF.

The allure of playing with Lebron James to compete for a championship is one failed regular season away from evaporating. He’s getting older and IF this season goes badly and the lakers end up in the lottery some top end guys may look at the prospects of playing with him 3-5 years down the road to not be as appealing as it is today.   People have been planting “le decline” seed for a few years now. I feel that this narrative is just simmering and waiting to pickup steam. When it does it will come fast and furious.

Blame low teacher pay on the politicians who're bought and paid for by people like the owners not the players who didn't do shit to teachers.   The money they make from outside is irrelevant to their income from the NBA. And Lebron James and other stars still generate a lot more than what they're paid so if anything they're underpaid.

he could have had a big one year balloon payment with LA but he and aaron mintz took offense to the lakers prioritizing lebron james and kawhi leonard over him.   ego is a killer.  
Difference is he's LeBron James
Its LeBron James. He was gonna get that money regardless. 
"It's more complicated than him ""wanting to be the guy's. He was simply overshadowed massively by LeBron in Cleveland. Between LeBron calling him ""kid"" (the story of LeBron telling Ky ""don't worry kid, I'll come back to Cleveland one day), the ""is LeBron like your father"" question, and James getting all the credit for wins, he just wanted more respect. He has that in Boston. As soon as he came here, he was gushing about the city. He praised Brad constantly, and is great friends with Tatum, and his friendly with damn near the whole team. The Celtics are far more stable, the team does not live and die by one player. There's been no evidence the entire time he's been in Boston that he'd rather be somewhere else.  His ""I'd love to play in New York"" remark came in 2016, in case you bring that up."
He's so good. He's so good. He's so good. He's so good - Lebron James 
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.   I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.   and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this.""  it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""   and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.  edit2: i just thought of something else, i've been pinning this on ""the government"" when there are plenty of private companies and organizations with the funding and technology to do something like this. i mean people this is 2018.....wouldn't you be more shocked if by this point someone HADN'T tried to create a super human by now? but you never thought that you might have been watching one this whole time.

"You think so? I think he's 100% spot on, especially for African Americans.   70% of African Americans are born in the United States without fathers, that's due to premarital sex. The largest indicators of economic mobility and success in America are 1. being raised by two parents, and 2. graduating high school. Well, you're far more likely to graduate high school if you have a father. This might be the single most important hill to die on. Seriously.  One of the reason I love Lebron James so much is because he is such a great role model all around. Not just speaking on issues, but by leading through his actions. He's a great father and seems to be a great husband, too. That is a shining light that MILLIONS of kids can emulate; kids who themselves grew up without fathers and can break that cycle.   Good on ya, Isaac."

Devin Booker - 34.5 points/100p, 56% TS, 105 offensive rating.

"I choose neither. I want a team of Jason Kidd, Chris Paul, Lonzo Ball, Rajon Rondo, and Lebron James with no bodies. They could use their immense basketball IQ's to win somehow."
"&gt;Funny enough I see a lot of parallels to Kevin Love on the most recent Cavs teams.  not funny at all because he got beat on by Cavs fans for years for ""falling off,"" aka ""I completely changed my game to accommodate LeBron James and an extremely ball-centric point guard."""
So I'm guessing Lebron is Harry. Or...Lebron is James Potter and Ingram is Harry Potter. 
"If LeBron James dropped a $100 bill during a game, he would have made it back by the time it hit the ground and tripled it by the time he picked it back up."
"Yes. From an impact perspective, using plus-minus derived metrics, Nash is second to (I think) LeBron James in terms of offensive impact.  EDIT:  Yeah, using RAPM, Steve Nash was worth 7points per 100 possessions on offense, which only LeBron beats (in the era we have measurements on):  https://public.tableau.com/views/14YearRAPM/14YearRAPM?:embed=y&amp;:showVizHome=no"
"&gt; You'd never call James Harden one of the NBAs best passers and yet statistically he is.  This is my favorite part of Harden's game.  Better passers:  Chris Paul, LeBron, Rondo, who else? Maybe Jokić, maybe Rubio, maybe Simmons.  Harden can find the gap so easily it's beautiful."
"Harden is one of the leagues best passers, up there with his teammate and Lebron James. It's weird to me that one would watch that guy and not consider him a great passer and just put so much of his work down to ""Dantoni ball"". A lot of that is putting the ball in his hands, letting him run pick and roll or isolate and do his thing. He puts shooters and a roll man on the floor, but Harden still has to make the plays.   It's hard to buy into the idea that Harden and Nash aren't great creators and lack some of level of creativity or an ability to see ahead. It's harder to buy into arguments revolving around one guy playing with seeming casualness. That comes off more as what you like to see rather than any kind of point about what is successful. "
"This is where I give a point to Lebron in the MJ vs LJ debate. Jordan never had to play against zone defenses. Hell, he even got to go to the line for a free throw if a defense even thought about doing anything close to resembling a zone.   Meanwhile, Lebron James has faced some semblance of a zone defense in almost every game he's played his entire career. If you don't think that has affected James ability to score then we just don't have the same understanding of the game..."
"Yeah, I bet scrubs like *checks list* Michael Jordan, LeBron James*, Larry Bird and Isiah Thomas who never played in the West would have 35% less all star appearences, fuck those guys.  (*Yet)"

"I don't mean  &gt; parents that threaten to abandon us if we had sex in our teens  I meant, the solution to a successful society is a successful upbringing. We gotta start there.

"Lebron's teams have 'success' in the pathetic East.  They are 1-8 in the last 2 Finals.  The Pelicans, Jazz, Thunder, Rockets, and Warriors would all crush the Cavs this year. All those teams would easily win the East. 4 or 5 teams last year in the West could have beaten the Celtics in the 2017 ECF. Easily.  With Irving and Love the Cavs just have way more talent then anyone in the East.  Lebron was not an infinitely better defender in his prime.  Even in his prime KD dropped 30+ points on 65% TS in the Finals against Leborn.  Lebron never got 30+ on 65% TS against KD in the Finals.  KD is an elite rim protector and can switch 1-5 on pick and roll.  He started against Jrue Holiday and James Harden in the playoffs.  Switchability and rim protection are the 2 most important attributes for modern NBA defenses and KD is absolutely elite in both."

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but that is for his 2018 earnings through July, not his overall net worth  For example, read this from [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/07/01/lebron-james-takes-big-step-in-goal-to-be-a-billionaire-with-move-to-lakers/#4a301faa1956):  &gt; Forbes last deep dive into James’ net worth was two years ago as part of our look at the 40 Richest Entrepreneurs Under 40. Our estimate was $275 million, but James has banked another $170 million, including endorsements, since then, and the stock market continues to move higher. James has made $765 million, including off-court earnings, since he turned pro in 2003. Of course, taxes and expenses eat up a major chunk of those proceeds.  So, I don't think saying that his **net worth** is $85.5 million is accurate or correct.  EDIT: Added some more info"

"When the next labor dispute pops up, an owner who is a former player may be more sympathetic to the players' demands.

Take for example when LeBron James had the n word allegedly spray painted on his gate despite living in a very very nice neighborhood and somehow without catching the person on surveillance camera from any house nearby. Then when the police show up he had already cleaned it off. So basically everyone went off LeBron’s word for this, then it all disappeared and no one was ever caught. "
"You can't compare the two at all. The reason why its differnt is because kawhi was injured!!! Theres nothing else to go by on, hes been out for a year. Kawhi was hooping in the playoffs Its not like he had 1 big game and now hes the best in the world. He was leading his team up by 20 against the best shooting team in nba history. It was him &amp; the genius of pop blowing out the warriors. Then when zaza hurt him you saw what happened. He had the same effect as lebron, take him out of that team and now the team is borderline useless.   Also let me ask you something. Who was the focal point of the spurs offense in 2014? If you know anything about spurs basketball you should know that answer and just not assume he wasn't and just a glorified role player.  Kawhi is the best two-way defender in the league. Way better fit then KD, He can absouletly lockdown ANYBODY in the league.The lakers have a pass 1st point guard in lonzo, 2 scoring emerging stars in Ingram and Kuzma,a talented young bench and lebron. Add a scottie pippen type player to lebron then you already have the Defense,length and toughness to beat GSW.  Kevin Durant isn't an elite level defender. Yes hes a good paint protector with his block timing. But just a above average on-ball defender.  He was getting exposed when Cp3 or james harden was running pick and roll iso.  And exactly you cant compare the two because kawhi has been out. You can't stack up against the two because kawhi hasn't played since he got injured. Thats like saying ""I'll take D'Angelo Russell over kawhi"",What has kawhi done over the year. Its unfair to comepare an injured player to a healthy one."

"You disagree with ""best team since 2011"" because you left out the ""in the East"" part. You're dumb if you can't see how he's had the most stacked team in the East since joining Miami and returning to Cleveland.   If you're wondering how and why LeBron James' teams always have the most talent but aren't the best team. Look at the common denominator in all of those teams. LEBRON JAMES and his system revolving around him. Great system that makes LeBron the best he can be and makes role players better while making his star teammates forced to adjust and limiting what they can do due to not having the ball or just being stuck waiting for the pass to come."
Yeah but I'm like 99.9% sure that if I got to start all 4 years I could put up better college stats than LeBron James.
Here is something to get you started   So if Michael Jordan came into the league at 1984 that man got eliminated 84 85 86 87 88 89 and 90 the pistons and the Celtics whooped his ass every time ima tell u something else I used to watch the ngga scored 67 in one game against larry bird and still lost the game so it dont matter how great u are u not gon win by urself it is a TEAM sport michael jordan all 6 finals michael Jordan played against he went against first he went against the lakers that was magic johnsons last year he had aids james worthy and byron scott was out of the series cus they was hurt so it was just michael jordan against a sorry lakers team the next year he go against portand trailblazers who didn’t have nobody but clyde Drexler and who? kevin duckworth? aww he sorry who else did they have? jerome kersey? aw he sorry and then who they go against the next year? the phoenix suns? u had charles barkley and who else? kevin johnson and dan marley? man them nggas aint no competition and then u left if he was so good when u left the bulls to go play baseball Michael Jordan u left the bulls after u left the bulls they had won 58 games the next year they won 56 games with scottie pippen so that let u know scottie pippen was still hoopin cus even after u left they still went to the end of the playoffs and almost made it to the finals and went 7 games with the knicks so what u talkin about?

"Really wanted to pull for Nash but in the east I think I’ll take A.  I think it all fits together better, it’s it’s going to be a lot better defensively.  Steph (or probably Klay) would shred Nash, as a shooting guard 4th option on a  loaded team PG13 and Klay is a essentially a draw.  Lebron &gt; KD but it’s close.  KG &gt; Dirk in this exercise for the defense.  And Ben Wallace and Dwight is essentially a push cause they’ll take simple roles and both are elite at that (but Ben probably would buy in better). I’ll take A.  And the West is also tough.  Prime CP3 was a god. Gimme Kobe because elite defender, plus James skills are nullified a little on a loaded team because the biggest thing he brings is being a one man offense.  People might flame this, but Kawhi v Pippen is pretty even.  Kawhi is a way better shooter which on a team like this is a huge deal cause everybody will have to play off the ball more.  But I think the front court is what gives in the D.  Prime Shaq is the best player of the bunch, and AD complements him really well.  Motombo and Duncan aren’t nearly as good offensively, and would be the deciding factor.  In the finals I think I’m gonna stick with D.  Kobe and Pippen are a great defensive duo on Steph and KD. You probably have the most dominant player on the floor in Shaq, and AD is a solid matchup for KG.  "

"being a veteran does not commute you from being a shit human. Look into McCain and tell me he's a ""good guy"" its bullshit.  That also doesn't mean disrespecting veterans to protest is the right thing to do. These realizations require some discretion, nuance, and perspective. Something reddit severely lacks.  Let me spell it out.  1. No problem with protesting police brutality against minorities, I think it's fucked up too.  2. Do have a problem with doing so by kneeling during the national anthem that is meant to respect the military. Kneel on first down, both sides or something, kneel after the game, kneel literally any other time and you're fine in my book. This protest is disrespectful in execution, not in purpose.  3. All veterans do not get a pass to be shitbags for the rest of their lives.  4. Veterans in general deserve our respect and deserve to be treated well UNLESS they are shitbags, and then they can rot in hell with the rest of the shitbags.  5. John McCain was indeed a shitbag and a veteran. Unfortunately for him, being a shitbag overrides his status as a veteran. This is common sense.  Therefore.  This protest is garbage, though the subject of the protest is not.  We should respect veterans, but not McCain.  Nike has put Collin up there on THEIR pedastal with the likes of Tiger Woods, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, etc. That is disrespectful to those guys as well as the USA.  Collin was a washed up QB who wanted attention, has NEVER experienced the prejudice he protested, and was doing this as a shot in the dark to avoid being fired cashing in on his race which is real fucked up period.    end post.   edit: mass downvotes, not 1 reply of significance, just hollow insults and ""orang man bad"".  I wonder if in 50 years people will look back and realize those who weren't paid to act this way were literally parodies of their own ideals."

"Kyrie Irving is a much better scorer than Kyle Lowry will ever hope to be, because he's almost unguardable 1 on 1, thanks to his quickness and elite ball-handling and ability to score from anywhere on the court. Scoring points is really the only area in which he has a significant impact, though. He's not a good defender, not a great playmaker, he gets tunnel vision a lot, etc.  Kyle Lowry on the other hand is a more versatile and cerebral player who is far better at playmaking, defense (on and off the ball, although his on-ball defense has declined lately with age), and running the offense. He likes to do a lot of hardly noticeable ""little things"" off the ball as well (good cutter, amazing rebounder at PG, draws charges, sometimes sets screens and boxes out, etc.), since he began his career as a bench warmer and it took years for him to break out into a star.  People love to act all like ""DON'T EVER MENTION KYRIE IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS THAT BUM"" when it comes to comparing Lowry and Irving, because Irving's PPG is higher and Lowry's game doesn't have the same razzle dazzle (even though it's incredibly effective). I like to imagine that these are the same people who think Andre Roberson is a China-tier scrub, or the same people who think Devin Booker is worth $158 million.  In my personal opinion, it's a wash, really - both of these guys are superstar-calibre players in their primes, both of whom are excellent second options to complement an even better player. But I think Kyrie Irving playing next to LeBron James (arguably the best player of all time) helped him and his reputation a lot, while Kyle Lowry playing next to DeMar DeRozan (a fringe star masquerading as a superstar, and also one of the all time worst playoff performers) hurt him and his reputation a lot. Lowry was always the best player on the Raptors, and he never got to complement an even better player, until the Raptors traded away DeMar DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard."

"You can’t really think that his 3pt% fluctuating is anything other than statistical variance, right? Cause it doesn’t make sense to glean anything from. 7 game sample size. In your mind he’s a fraud who somehow was faking being a good shooter and then got exposed?  He got bullied on defense by LeBron James. 1v1. Any point guard in the league will get bullied by lebron in those circumstances. That’s more on Stevens for committing to switching everything and refusing to double. Where as Kerr had a help defender waiting in the lane for lebron every time he got switched onto curry."
Hey guys did you know /u/Iwasbornathalfcourt thinks Lebron James is a very good player
"Michael Jordan was drafted on June 19, 1984  Lebron James was born in the same year: December 30, 1984  Lebron James was drafted on June 26, 2003  So the next successor will *obviously* be someone who was born in late 2003 ^/s"
Tucker received little secondary help during that series because the Cavaliers were able to surround LeBron with shooters + an elite half court option who you never help off under any circumstances in Kyrie Irving. Those Cavs were in the midst of one of the greatest offensive playoff runs in NBA history. The Lakers do not have that level of offensive support around James.
Every time I hear about Oladipo I think about his Grantland pre-draft interview where he said “I’m not going out to party. I gotta guard LeBron James tomorrow night” it was an answer to a  hypothetical question but the dudes been all about that life since Day 1. Awesome to see him make consistent jumps into becoming a superstar
"Sure they do. Because of the way LA is constructed Houston will be able to help off non shooters (Rondo, Lance, potentially Ball) to double LeBron. He doesn’t have a Irving that you’re ultra concerned about going off because of the intense converage towards James. Tucker + a secondary defender shading towards LeBron is solid resistance. Of course, he’s still LeBron and can still dominate.   Regardless of LeBron’s increased support, the Rockets are a good enough team to beat LeBron’s team without limiting him. "

"I never once said LeBron was better. I just don't think bringing in stats and comparing them as equal is right either, especially defensive stats and the fact that their rookie years are so spread apart. I'd love to see how good Simmons stats would be if he was out on that rookie LeBron Cavs roster in place of Bron. It also annoys me that you think people assuming/thinking LeBron James being better than Simmons (who had a year of prep) is far fetched or something lol. I personally don't give a shit who was better their first years because it means nothing."
"Please enlighten me then. Of all of the people commenting that LeBron's rookie season was 'way better' than Ben's, none of them have provided any thought on exactly *why* it was better despite the stats saying otherwise.

&gt; on a absolutely garbage team  So that's a good thing now because we're talking about the sub's lord and saviour LeBron Raymone James? KLove puts up great numbers at the TWolves but those are widely considered to be 'empty stats' because he played on a garbage team.
"Jesus, this sub is so far up LeBron's clacker it's not funny. The dude wasn't 'way better' in his rookie year than Simmons. LeBron was inefficient, his TS% was 48.8%. He averaged significantly less rebounds and assists. His offensive rating was less than his defensive rating (-5 differential), never a good sign. Simmons was at +9. He averaged less blocks and steals with slightly more turnovers. He had a negative DBPM. Simmons had much better advanced stats, 4.6 BPM vs 1.9, 4.6 VORP vs 3.1, 9.6 WS vs 5.1, 0.162 WS/48 vs 0.078. Simmons *averaged* a per 100 triple double and what's more he got his team an additional 24 wins and a playoff berth. Just because he's LeBron James doesn't mean he instantly becomes better than every other player at every single aspect of the game. The guy was phenomenal for an 18/19yo kid going up against grown men and I'm not suggesting he had a bad rookie season, it was brilliant but Simmons was also brilliant in his rookie season. To say that LeBron was 'way better' as a rookie is just completely and utterly incorrect no matter how many deluded upvotes you are getting..."

"It's not just fans once a reputation lasts even amongst NBA players and to an extent teams it's there.   LeBron James wanted Jamal Crawford to come to the Cavs last summer. Players often don't think in terms of defense they think in terms of a guys reputation and/or ""Can this guy get buckets?"" Do people really think James Harden and Chris Paul were out here going back and watching a ton of Melo tape the past few years and looking at his defense whenthey were lobbying for him to come to Hou this summer? No.....again it's just about reputation and the focus of ""can this guy get buckets"" is prominent in many players minds when thinking how good or bad someone is.   In Crawford's case being a genuinely good guy(which in case that reputation is 100% warranted he is) also helps. Not only do people like a guy such as that his experience is also going to give him all kinds of credibility in an NBA locker room in a way fans don't necessarily realize. "

This was a problem, as I had just been watching Space Jam on Netflix, and had only just seen Jordan team up with the looney toons. I was briefly frustrated, but began to consider my other options. Since I couldn't watch it anymore, I grabbed my backpack and pulled out my trusty travel book, LeBron James's Biography. I split open the pages, letting my bookmark guide me to where I'd last been.

"Yeah but Lonzo's ability to rack up assists on such low usage is crazy.   Lonzo, Rondo and Draymond are the only 3 guys in the league to get 6+ assists on &lt;20% USG (all ~17%). Lebron's never played with a playmaker like that.  The usage rate of Lonzo and Rondo combined adds up to roughly 1 Russell Westbrook (34%) and less than James Harden (36%).  Overall, in terms of usage, Rondo + Lonzo + Lebron = Westbrook + Durant.    I think if we see the playmaking centred entirely around these three then we should see them maintain a pretty good level of play.     That's assuming that Lonzo plays at his rookie level too and doesn't see a sophomore jump.   Also, with Rondo moving to the bench (dropping his USG) and Lebron saying he wants to play off-ball a little more  (dropping his USG) I think there might actually be enough space for Lonzo to feast."

Problem is beating a 73 win team takes more than just Lillard.  2015: Lillard averaged 22 against a great defensive team.  Unfortunately Wes was injured and Aldridge forgot how to shoot a basketball.  2014: Lillard averaged 26 in round one and hit the series winner.

Wade, in his best season (2008-09) averaged 49% from the field, 56.7 TS%, and EFG of 50.4% For efficiency comparison, and in their best seasons (in order of FG%, TS%, and EFG%): Iverson (42.5, 51.8, 45.2), Gervin (50.4, 56.4, 50.7), Miller (47.1, 61.4, 54.4), Drexler (47.2, 54.7, 48.6)  NOTE: for the record, James Harden’s MVP season that just passed - he recorded a 29.8 PER, which is short of Wade’s 30.4 that year.

He led his team to the Eastern Conference Finals in his third season (imagine Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, or Jamal Murray putting up postseason stats in their third seasons like below- all entering their 3rd seasons)  Eastern Conf Finals against the 64 win Pistons coming off 2 consecutive finals appearances and a championship:  27 PPG, 6 RPG, 5 APG, 62% FG, 81% FT  NBA FINALS 2006  After 2 sub par performances on the road in Dallas in Games 1 and 2, and obviously falling into a 2-0 series deficit, Wade went onto to lead the Heat to 4 straight victories and the Miami Heat's first championship in Franchise History, on the back of these numbers, here are the key games:  Game 3: 42 PTS, 13 REB Game 4: 36 PTS Game 5: 36 PTS, 10 REB, 5 ASTS, 4 STL, 3 BLK  AVG: 35PPG, 8RPG, 4APG, 3SPG, 1BPG  John Hollinger wrote in 2012, that this series performance by Wade, may have been better any of Jordan's 6, ahead of Magic, Bird, Kobe, or Duncan, Russell.  ""Whilst it seems strange to having anyone besides Michael Jordan in the top spot for the greatest finals performance of all time, the truth is, Jordan never dominated a finals series to this extent. Many called Wade's 2006 finals ""jordanesque"". They may have been selling Dwyane Wade short"".  Definitely a debatable quote by Hollinger, but you get the message about how great it was.  WHAT HAPPENED AFTER?  For those who aren't aware, Dwyane made a decision that he would later regret for the rest of his career - choosing to remove his meniscus in his knee in college after listening to poor medical advice.  The meniscus plays a crucial role - without it the long term risks to knee damage are severely high, including loss of cartilage amongst other ailments. For more info on Wade's injury history, here's a link:  http://heathoops.com/2013/11/through-severe-knee-injuries-dwyane-wade-continues-to-endure/  After winning the championship in 2006, D-Wade battled the knee that was beginning to show bad signs and his body began to give up on him, leading critics on the path of wandering if Wade was going to be the next T-Mac - possibly the greatest who never made it there. He missed super large chunks of the ensuing 2006-07 season, as was shut down for the majority of the 2007-08 season, where the Heat finished with a mere 15-67 record, leading to the selection of Michael Beasley with the 2nd overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft.  The critics at the time were out there loud and clear after multiple knee and shoulder surgeries: ""Will Dwyane Wade ever be the same he once was?"" - with the latter agreeing to ""No."" LeBron James enjoyed a remarkable ascension during these missed years that Wade was out.  Wade worked out with Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant's trainer during the 2007-08 season and 2008 offseason, Tim Grover, who believed Wade wouldn't just come back to the league, he'd be back at a higher level.  Well that statement turned out to be an understatement. Wade went onto lead the 2008 USA Olympics Team in scoring (off the bench), and played a pivotal role in delivering the Gold medal after Team USA's loss to Argentina only a couple of years prior (the Redeem Team).  And that was just the beginning of Wade's monster return.  In 2008-09, Wade led a supporting cast of rookie Michael Beasley, Mario Chalmers, Udonis Haslem, Daquon Cook etc to 43-39 and a playoff spot.  He joined 2 other players in NBA history to rack up 2,300 points, 350 rebounds, and 500 assists in a single season.  Those players are Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  And he didn't even win the regular season MVP this season, It took an all time campaign from LeBron to trump him. Lets look at their 2008-09 stats side by side:  D-Wade 30.2 PPG (1st) 7.5 APG (9th) 5.0 RPG 2.19 SPG (2nd)  LeBron 28.4 PPG (2nd) 7.3 APG (10th) 7.6 RPG 1.7 SPG (7th)  LeBron that year, had the 12th most win shares of all time (the most since Jordan in 96'), led the Cavs to the best record in the league, it took that campaign to trump Wade's amazing all-time season.  WRAP-UP:  During the LeBron Heat years, you could clearly see with every season that went by, Wade's knees were just not up to the task of the gruelling grind of the long postseason runs.  In 2011 against Dallas, had the Heat won that series and LeBron not have had a shocking series, he would have been named finals MVP.  From 2012, Dwyane had decided it was best to take a clear backseat to LeBron, in order to preserve his longevity in the league, due to the health problems mentioned above. Imagine the luxury of having quite possibly the best second option in league history - because we all know when D wade was 80%+ healthy, he'd go tick for tack with LeBron when they went up against each other, and you couldn't really see a major gap between their playing abilities.  In 2012 Against OKC, he played a massive back up role to LeBron averaging 20+ PPG alongside him.  In 2013, you could begin to see LeBron taking even more of a larger role due to wade's health decline. Wade averaged less than 20PPG that series, however had a key game 4 that was essential to avoid a 3-1 series deficit. From there it was the LeBron show.  LeBron left straight after the near sweep to the Spurs in 2014, as this was the peak season of Wade's ability decline. He could see his health has set him back where could no longer be that old D-Wade, so the timing was perfect to return home and make good on his life long promise of delivering that city a championship.  It's amazing how Wade is considered a top 3 SG despite all this adversity he had to go through with health issues that it leaves us to think - IMAGINE had wade enjoyed the health fortune of LeBron throughout his entire career. There was a reason he was growing comparisons to the young Michael Jordan during his prime years, and it wasn't a laughable comparison.  He slashed like him, shared his explosion to the rim, his relentless at playing at full intensity and throwing his body around, and delivering in crunch time moments.  He offered all of us moments that I will pass onto my kids one day, an all timer, a first ballot, and a player you could always count on, over and again.  Just as you thought he was finished over the last 3 years, he started to tease us with vintage Wade flashes and moments, like the clutch performance that stunned Charlotte against the purple shirt man. Or the return to Miami after 2 long years away, and hitting the dagger in Ben Simmons face to remind him he was a rookie.  So yeah, I think he deserves a farewell tour "
Pelinka used an analogy to discuss the young guys being around LeBron James.

"First off, I want to say that we're on the same side of the argument here. The only difference is, I feel like you're at the Dan Gilbert hate level that I was at 2 years ago. Once again, I hate Gilbert, I think he's a complete idiot. However, he bought the team IIRC in LeBron's 3rd year. He didn't have the full first 7 years of LeBron's career to build a team, nor a total of 11 years.   I agree, I'm so glad he left for the Heatles. It was awesome to watch in Miami. I actually believe he should have never left Miami. He should have let Pat re-tool the team. Guys like Pau Gasol were ready to sign there once LeBron committed.  If LeBron stays in Miami in 2015, lets say they get Pau, maybe they still get Deng on the cheap as a Battier-like replacement. Ray Allen comes back for a final year (he almost signed with the Cavs in 2015). They almost certainly take out the 2015 warriors who I felt like weren't ready to win that finals. I think if Kyrie doesn't go down, they probably lose. ANYWAYS, I think the Heat could win that 2015 title vs the Warriors. Maybe after another 2-3 years he still goes to LAL.  I think it was a huge mistake going back to Cleveland. My biggest problem with Cleveland 2.0, was that Dan Gilbert flew down to Miami and sucked LeBron's dick off again. He should have said, hey, if you want to come back thats fine, but i'm running the show. They should have kept Irving + Wiggins and built a 10-12 year core around them. Instead they catered to everything LeBron. They turned a decade playoff team + possible contender into a 4 year finals run vs arguable the best team ever. While teams like the Celtics, Bucks, and 76ers are building for Post-Warriors dynasty, Cleveland threw that future away. But don't worry!!! They made sure to max Kevin Love (@ 30m, no other team might give him that money outside of like Charlotte). Love is going to keep them as the 10th seed for no reason at all.   He doesn't know when to try and win, he doesn't know how to build a team, he doesn't know how to tank right, he's just an idiot. Also what they did to David Blatt and Griffin who I felt is over rated, but he did build the championship team is disgusting. Cleveland doesn't even know how to handle success. It's like a white trash family that wins the lottery, and a few years later everyone overdoses on drugs and blows the money.   I agree with your final statement. The biggest fuckups in the Cleveland 1.0 era where losing on Boozer with a hand shake agreement because you wanted to keep Varejao? And not talking Michael Redd into leaving Milwaukee to play besides James. I never saw a legit season during the Cleveland 1.0 years where they should have won the title. They should have probably beat the Magic in 2009, but that entire team was on fucking steroids and paint defense + 3 point shooters is the blue print to beat lebron. (Mavs 2011, KG Celtics, Warriors).  I actually believe the 2011 Mavericks were the better team and even if LeBron played better it wouldn't have mattered. The Heat had no PG, no bench, Joel Anthony was the starting Center, peak Dirk with Kidd and a Mavs team that was together for a couple years now. The 2015 spurs were just amazing. I think the 2015 Cavs or 2015 Heat with LeBron win the title without injuries, but then I think the 2016 would have been the Warriors year as they would have been motivated to get over the hump.  I don't see another scenario where LeBron has more than 3 rings, do you? Unless KD decides to stay in OKC in 2017 after the Warriors might have won the 2016 title?  what LeBron from 2003-2010 should have won the title? He lost to all time great Celtic teams."

"He led a 46 win team in PTS, REB, AST and TS% (the only guy to lead all four in the entire NBA). Talking about half the games is very selective and purposely obtuse. If you want to have a productive discussion, you should look at a player's game and impact top to bottom, instead of trying to pick certain stats that paint them in a bad light.   If you want to see some numbers that paint Jokic in a good light, here are a few:  * Led the NBA in both jumpshot FG% and hookshot FG% (only player to do it since we can measure those) * Jokic leads all players in TAPG (total assists per game, assists + screen assists) * Led the NBA in '17 in points per possession in both the high and low post * Last season, Jokic scored 1.26 ppp in iso play * Nuggets score 1.432 ppp when he passes from the post * No player in NBA history matches Nikola's per minute PTS, AST, REB numbers * Here's where Jokic ranks in some stats **all-time**:    * 3rd in ORtg    * 8th in career BPM    * 10th in career PER    * 12th in career WS/48 * Jokic has more triple-doubles than any international player in NBA history * Jokic has the fastest triple-double in NBA history  Here are *Player Impact Charts* for some prominent NBA floor generals:  * [Nikola Jokic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dfx_2zOWAAANA5f.jpg:large) * [Steph Curry](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfyQDluV4AER5-A.jpg:large) * [Ben Simmons](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dfx9ljDXUAASLNg.jpg:large) * [James Harden](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfyUxUTU0AE0JC1.jpg) * [LeBron James](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfySiEQU0AQLDwn.jpg) * [Lonzo Ball](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfyCUCLXcAAFK95.jpg)  You'll notice that every single person on the Nuggets roster was a net positive when playing with Jokic, and only Harris was a bare positive without him.  If you look at basic on/off numbers on [NBA.com](https://NBA.com), Jokic has an elite transformative impact on the team.  Honestly, just watching Jokic play for a few games removes all doubt about his talent. This guy is a weapon of the highest caliber and will dominate the game for years to come.   &amp;#x200B;"
"&gt; (by some very large margins at time, e.g. 2-5x + productivity)  aka a 10x-er, as in someone who's 10x as productive as the average employee.  Realistically it's closer to 2-5x, as you said, but the math changes when it comes to the NBA for two major reasons  1)  Jimmy Butler is still a top 25 player in the league.  It may sound stupid but let me remind you what that *actually* means- there are, **AT MOST**, 24 players in the world who are better at helping a basketball team win games.  **TWENTY FOUR**- chances are, you've never really interacted with anyone as good at anything as Jimmy Butler is at basketball.  In other words, Jimmy Butler would probably be more like a 30x-er than a 10x-er.  2) Unlike other jobs, there are a limited number of minutes to go around- in other words, minutes are zero-sum.  What this means is that while Walmart could hire 10 people instead of one '10x-er' and get the same output (in a highly idealized, theoretical example), the Timberwolves can't just put more players on the floor.  edit: I forgot the 3rd thing, the salary cap.  IMO the only way to consistently contend for championships is to gain value, and there are only two **reliable** ways to gain value in the current CBA (the third way is just to be better and smarter about scouting, development, and management but 'be better at everything' is basically a non-strategy).  1) Rookie contracts- I mean, duh.  You literally couldn't pay Ben Simmons or Donovan Mitchell or Jayson Tatum even if you wanted to.  2) Max contracts where the player is worth **significantly more** than the max.  Lebron James will always be a bargain because you literally aren't allowed to pay him what he's worth.  The only other way to gain value is with some lucky gambles or loyalty discounts, like Steph and his ankles or Klay and his Klaytheism."
"&gt;last season his usage was 21.7 which was 118th in the league   His usage was 29.6 according the basketball reference and NBA.com.  according to the same sites, Wiggins had a 23.2 and 23.4.  So Lavine is just a couple percentage points off of LeBron James in usage, in other words.   &gt;Good efficiency means better than average TS%, I thought that was fairly straightforward.  It is straightforward, thanks for that.  What doesn't seem to be straightforward; however, is what our definition of ""average"" is, considering Lavine was sub 50% from TS, again according to NBA.com and BR.  That leaves him at 408 out of 519 qualifying players for the metric.  So he's using the ball at almost the same rate as Stephen Curry, and shooting it with comparable efficiency to Dwayne Buycks.    &gt;Also there’s a bad rep with having high usage, if you’re efficient there’s nothing wrong with it   I agree. He's not tho.  &gt;Wiggins and KAT both had significantly higher usage than him last season, and Shabazz’ was about even with LaVine’s  No they didn't.  I already spelled out how much higher his usage was than Wiggins, but towns was at 22.9.  coincidentally shooting 64.6 TS.    &gt;he’s not a ball stopper either, he puts up about 3 apg and his AST% was about even with Donovan Mitchell, Manu Gimobili, Kelly Olympic, Lance Stephenson, Will Barton. None is these guys are known as ball stoppers.  So, A.) this happened in a per 100 context of 26 shots, 5 assists and 3 turnovers, meaning every 100 times he ended a possession, he only got an assist 14-15% of the time, which is 4-5% more than the much maligned, and third choice, Andrew Wiggins.  Lavine was playing his way to form/fitness last year during an end of season littered with tanking teams, and at a point where the bulls only real aim was losing and getting Lavine into form, ergo the 29% usage rate.  So, you know yer right--thats right around Donovan Mitchell, but that wasn't a particularly good stat for Donovan Mitchell, and in fact is likely one of the things Mitchell should be working on.  Donovan Mitchell was a high usage player, and he needs to work on his efficiency.  That's not any different than what I'm saying for Lavine.  Actually there is a difference: I believe in Donovan Mitchell's ability to adjust here and become a hyper efficient, high usage player.    I'm not sure I believe Lavine's ability to do so, especially with a $78m incentive to prove to everyone he's too dog.   &gt;So idk if you have preconceived notions with LaVine or what, but most of your opinions on him seem to be incorrect and unfounded.   I do, and they're based on his freaking performances!  Can he get better? Sure? Is he a $78m player?  I'll take Josh Richardson for 40m instead, please.  But i appreciate the convo so you get an up it's."

"Basically that lineup is replacing Lowry with FVV who is a 41% three point shooter. He doesn't have near the volume of Lowry, but its not like you're inserting a non-shooter into the lineup.  &amp;#x200B;  Butler is basically league average from 3 usually, or around it so he's not great but you still have to guard him. Kawhi is elite. OG shoots it well off the catch. And as a C Siakam has flashed range but nothing concrete there. Though he can stretch it out to mid range more than say a Cappella or a Gobert.  &amp;#x200B;  Its not an elite shooting lineup but its not like that would be a weakness imo. I think the only weakness on the team would be a strong PnR Big. Siakam is good, but he doesn't have that vertical gravity of a Jordan/Capella/Gobert etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Playmaking would be similar to 3pt shooting. Not amazing, but not poor either.  &amp;#x200B;  Butler and Kawhi are both adept in the PnR. Kawhi is good for his position and good for a secondary ball handler. He basically ran the offence his MVP season in San Antonio. Not a big assist man but he moves the ball when within an offence.  &amp;#x200B;  Butler I think its fantastic in the PnR at both scoring and passing. Not saying he's James Harden, but I think if you used him in the PnR more rather than iso-ing so much he could get his assists up to 6 or 7 a game. He already averages 5 a game and I think there's more playmaking ability to tap into with him if you spread the floor with shooters and get him in the PnR. I think him and Kawhi would play off each other really well too within that kind of offence in the Lebron/Kyrie mould of a your turn/my turn to run the spread PnR kind of offense.  &amp;#x200B;  But yeah, obviously they'd be a better team with Lowry than without him because Lowry is really good. if you could get Butler and keep Lowry that would be an incredible team."

"Okay. The way you phrased it suggested that Kyrie shows up and Dame does not. Regardless, your statement seems heavily influenced by *one series* and doesn't reflect the reality, which is that Dame has performed comparably to (if not better than) Kyrie in the playoffs, on average. Kyrie has had playoff series as bad as Dame has, including CHI in '15 and ATL in '15 and '16. The difference is that Kyrie has had the luxury of playing with LeBron James, who could carry them to the finals when Kyrie struggled. He's also had more appearances (again, thanks to LeBron) to offset his bad performances.   So just like Dame, sometimes, Kyrie ""shows up for the playoffs, sometimes he doesn't."" Your perception seems heavily influenced by recency bias. "

"“We all know it people: Michael Jeffery Jordan has the acting gene and LeBron just doesn’t. If it wasn’t for his buddy Ryan Coogler and his legacy saving casting of LeBron, Prince James wouldn’t be able to hold a candle to the REAL king’s killer acting instinct!” "
"People's bodies and especially brains are incredibly complex things and we're talking about the top .001% of basketball players in the world.  Jimmy is quite physically gifted vs the overwhelming majority of people - combine that with his work ethic, and you have one of the dozen or so best basketball players in the world. But even subtle marginal differences in natural ability can count for a lot at the very top. Jimmy may not be limited physically compared to your average NBA player, but compared to LeBron? You can train your body and mind to be better, but *everyone* is training hard at that level, and that's not to mention the whole working smarter vs. working harder thing.   Let's just pretend Jimmy works at it an hour more a day than anyone else. But maybe LeBron's brain can get the same amount of insight from film study in 30 minutes that Jimmy does in an hour. Maybe Curry's natural coordination made him better at shooting and ball handling from the beginning, and allow him to tweak and improve them more efficiently. Maybe James Harden processes things 5% quicker on the court, giving him a knack for exploiting defenses. Even if Jimmy works on his ability to read the defense, Harden can spend those same hours working on something else - maybe his ball handling and footwork, which further his natural advantage as an offensive player. All of these things add up, especially when you compound them over a decade plus of hard work.   And that's all just the brain. Jimmy will never be as tall as KD or Giannis, or have their wingspan. He can't shoot over people in the same way, no matter how hard he works. There are balls they can reach on defense that he just physically can't. He's a good athlete but he'll never have LeBron's vertical.  Also health - think of how healthy LeBron has been. He never has to stop improving. The month Jimmy takes off for a knee surgery here and there adds up. Not only is that time spent not getting better, it's more time spent having to get back to where you were. "

&gt; LeBron James’ arrival as the franchise’s cornerstone made it less appealing for Butler in the prime of his career.  So… winning is less appealing in the prime of your career? Sure we might not snag 50 wins but shit with Butler I honestly think we could get 55-60.

"You were better for a 5 year stretch, not close to a decade. In those 5 years(your best stretch as a franchise) you choked every playoffs and never even made it to the finals. Our last good team(08-10) won 2 championships. So in the past decade, we have two championships and you guys didn't even win a western conference finals. How do you have a chance to be better for the next decade? You guys don't even have butler yet and that's ignoring the fact that Lebron has absolutely dominated Butler for his whole career. Plus while you guys were choking in the playoffs, we were assembling exciting, young talent. Which means we have a lot of talent locked up on rookie contracts and we still have room for a max contract. So in total, we have Lebron James, lots of young talent on rookie contracts, and the ability to add a max player. You guys have MAYBE one exciting young player and a small chance to add Butler(a player who has been consistently dominated by LeBron). It's definitely looking like the Lakers are going to be better for the next decade. "
"Lebron James carried 2 teams (2007 Cavs and the Cavs w/o Kyrie and Love vs the Warriors) to the Finals.  These teams are statistically the 2 worst teams ever to play in a Finals in NBA history.    I’m gonna say it, MJ never had a tough matchup in the Finals.  Every team he played against were either injured, overrated, and/or old.  MJ never had to play against arguably the best player and team he would have the most trouble with in Hakeem and the Rockets.  Most of MJ’s struggle were in the Eastern Conference.  Look back at the teams LeBron had to play against, to make it easy we’ll say the Spurs, Mavs, and OKC all were equivalent to the teams MJ played against in the Finals.    But god damn the Warriors man.  They have been historically and statistically one of the best teams ever.  Their dynasty is going to be remembered for a long, long time.  This is the team LeBron had to face 3 times... in a row...  "
"OK but the owners are the ones who pay the players and everybody else in the organization, as well as front the money for the league to basically exist.  Without these ""suits"" there would be no NBA and LeBron James would be working at 24 hour fitness or as a sales manager. "

"Butler extremely upset in the tunnel, slams whiteboard heading in the locker room. Someone with the Cavs yells, ""Jimmy come on, quit being a f****** p***y!"" [It] was Lebron James.  After overheard in Wolves locker room  “He got me,” Butler said of Lebrons block, score, and subsequent insult on him. ""That f***ing Lebron boomed me."" Butler added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times. Butler then said he wanted to add Lebron to the list of players he leaves the Wolves to play with. "
"&gt;This guy left Lebron James,  Only once it became clear that LeBron was going to ditch Cleveland. Is there any dispute that Kyrie is in a better basketball situation now than if he had stuck around in Cleveland (where he would currently be trapped)?   Also, PG didn't even take a meeting with LeBron's team when he had the chance. Butler's list doesn't have the Lakers on it. Kawhi reportedly is going to the Clippers, not the Lakers if he leaves Toronto. Are all of thoes guys just ""totally different mindset"" or is it possible that playing with LeBron is not the draw that it once was? "
"People keep judging Kyrie Irving rumors based on basketball.   This guy left Lebron James, he already has his ring - his mindset could be totally different.   Maybe he just wants to be a star in Brooklyn or NYC. He grew up in Jersey. "
"Remember when great friends since they were teens, LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony teamed up?   Neither do i, despite countless chances to do so.   Jimmy wants Brooklyn, Knicks and Clippers because those are the starless destinations, with enough money to throw around, to give him a max 5 year deal, the last big deal of his career. He does not have a choice.    Kyrie does have a choice, he can be competitive and get paid."
This is the man who left lebron fucking James. Do not underestimate him.

"Worth noting: Kyrie Irving, Paul George, and Jimmy Butler have zero rings combined when playing on a team without LeBron James."

He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Kyrie Irving moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Chris Paul see the game from an x and o perspective, Kyrie has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event.  There's a reason Kyrie was able to lead LeBron James to the 2016 Finals. Put simply, Irving is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Goran Dragic or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Irving's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like Irving, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Kyrie."

"The season plays out about how you would imagine until the trade deadline where things go crazy.  The Celtics trade Rozier and Hayward for Anthony Davis, even though, through his agent he has adamantly stated that he will not stay with them next year, no matter what.  A source close to Adam Silver leaks that there was tampering Between Magic and Paul George, and rather than fine Magic, he was told in a back channel meeting that PG was never allowed to go to the Lakers as long as Magic was GM. The internet explodes when, an hour before the trade deadline, the Lakers trade Lonzo and Kuzma to Toronto for Kawhi and Greg Monroe. Reddit theorizes that this was always the plan and Magic is again accused of tampering, but it can't be proven and the deal goes through.  OKC clicks this season and surprizing everyone gets the 1 seed in the West. GSW is 2 Rockets 3 and Lakers 4 (they have a rough season up until the trade for Kawhi) The Lakers beat OKC in 6 and make the conference finals. The Rockets take GSW to 7 after boogie unfortunately aggravates his injury in game 5. In game 7, KD goes off and Harden disappears. D'Antoni benches Harden half way through the 3rd. Melo reaches his final form and drops 42 points and drills a clutch contested game winner to dethrone the Warriors.  in the WCF with the series tied at 1-1, Chris Paul goes down in game 3. Without the leadership of CP3, and with the Lakers firing on all cylinders behind Playoff Rondo, Leonard and LeBron the Lakers win in 5. Harden puts forth a great individual effort but it isn't enough. Melo averages 8 points in the series.  The Celtics and the 76ers make the ECF. The Celtics sweep the bucks to get there, and the 76ers beat the Jimmy Butler lead Heat in 6.   The 76ers take the Celtics to 6 behind a greatly improved Markel Fultz, Simmons and Embid, but the Celtics prove to be too much with 4 of their 5 starters averaging 20+ points per game. Davis averages 36/12/4/3/2 for the series.  The Lakers Celtics rematch is upon us. It is the most watched NBA Finals of all time. Kyrie and LeBron go toe to toe and the Finals are a slug fest. Lakers steal game 1 in Boston on a LBJ buzzer beater. With a chip on his shoulder, Kyrie scores 48 points and Celtics win game 2 by 9 points. Lakers take a 2 game lead in game 3 after Brown and Tatum both foul out in the 4th quarter. The game goes to overtime, but there is not enough defense to stop an Ingram and James barrage. Game 4 is close until half time, but Tatum and Brown come out hot in the second and can't miss from 3. Kyrie takes advantage of the floor spacing and slices up the defense, beating the Lakers in LA by 22 points. They win the next game by 14 as well, and the analysts are ready to call it. It is eluded to that LeBron is not happy with Kawhi's performance in the finals, but LeBron denies this saying, ""I am happy with anyone who gives everything they've got out there."" In game 6 Kawhi is a force on defense, completely shutting down shooters. It seems like he is everywhere on the court on the defensive end. Lebron puts up 45/12/10, Kawhi drops 28, as well as 6 steals and 3 blocks. They win by 11 and the series goes back to Boston.  In one of the most anticipated game 7s of all time, LeBron comes out firing on all cylinders. He scores the games first 12 points on back to back 3s, a trip to the line, a turn around jumper, and an and a backdoor cut to a dunk off a beautiful assist from playoff Rondo. The lakers defense erases everything on the other end.  Brad Stephens calls a time out. Whatever Brad says works, because the Cs come out of the timeout and look like different players. They even the score by mid way through the second and have a 4 point lead going into half 48-44. The second half is an offensive barrage. LeBron, Ingram and Kawhi can't miss. AD dominates on both ends. Kyrie is un-gaurdable. Brown, Tatum and Horford play like all stars. With 22 seconds left, down 2 LeBron wills himself to the basket, draws a foul, but misses the free-throw. The game is tied at 118. Kawhi Leonard steals the in-bounds pass, but Marcus Smart is right there, he strips the ball from Kawhi and after some juggling secures it and is fouled. He goes to the free-throw line. 14 seconds left. He hits the first. Misses the second. LeBron grabs the board and zips the pass to a streaking Rondo on the other end who draws 2 defenders and lobs the ball to Kawhi who is already in the air with a full head of steam. He posterizes Brown who was just a half a second too late, and draws the foul. 10 seconds left. Kawhi hits the clutch freethrow. Its 119-121. Kyrie rolls the ball up, picks it up near half court and passes off to AD who takes 1 dribble and Brad calls time out. 7 seconds left.  Tatum inbounds the ball to AD who hands off to Kyrie and sets a screen on LeBron, who fights through. With 4 seconds left Kyrie rises up for 3, but Ingram has left brown open under the basket to help LBJ close out on Kyrie. Kyrie at the peak of his jump zips the pass to brown, But Kawhi leaves tatum on the wing to close out on Brown who whips it to Tatum with 3, 2... 1...   Tatum drills the 3 and the Celtics are champions.  In the off season AD, true to his word, leaves Boston and signs with LA and Kawhi after considering his options decides to run with Boston.   The internet explodes again."
I was sorta agreeing with you but that last statement? Are you joking!? Nobody is locking up lebron james 
"KD breaks off from Curry, Klay, and Green to form GSW Wolfpac with Boogie, while LeBron is a solo Goldberg-type trying to keep his finals streak alive. The infighting seems to come to a climax, as LeBron is about to dunk on KD in Game 7 of the WCF to win the game when Klay attacks James with a stun gun out of nowhere, so KD wins and ends LeBron’s streak.  Then Curry returns after taking some time off to confront KD once and for all during the finals to see who the real MVP is, only for KD to do a technical foul of doom to purposely get ejected so Curry can easily beat out KD, where it’s revealed they all get back together to form a super GSW team. Meanwhile in the ECF, Mankind Fultz and the Sixers finally win and beat the WCF in the ratings for the first time in years, turning the tide in the war for NBA dominance forever. "

"Draymond. Whenever the Warriors face adversity he intimidates opponents and tries to hurt opposing stars and make them more hesitant. He [pulls Anthony Davis down to the floor and rolls around on the floor with him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKzJtSsXLQw), [pushes James Harden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPTw921HRE4), pokes [Lebron in the eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E09VpwYrPBc) etc  He does this stuff intentionally and only does it when the Warriors face the scary prospect of a close game if you pay attention to the trend. This is all just from one postseason every year he does this shit whenever the Warriors are in trouble and it is instrumental to swinging the momentum of games in the Warriors favor while Durant and Curry are having their annual choke."
He went to my high school and was a beast. Crazy to see him playing alongside Lebron fucking James now.

Lebron James
[ESPN] Lebron James questioning the legitimacy of a teammates injury
bruh they have Lebron James
"I agree. But the shift in what is required from bigs doesn't mean  that their former dominance will carry into the current era. PG play is certainly crucial to have playoff success. The only exception is if you have player at another position who can assume the traditional responsibilities of a PG, like LeBron (who for all intents and purposes, *is* a point guard in the traditional sense) and Harden.   Capella gets his easy points as a result of....phenomenal PG play! Capela is arguably a top five center I'd say. And yet hes not even in the conversation for top 25 player in the NBA, while all of the top five PG's are firmly entrenched in those rankings. There's no way in hell you'd want to start a team with Clint Capella over a great PG because you *know* that Capella is dependent on PG play to excel offensively.   Being the better team is often a case of being the more fortunate team in sports. That's just the way it works. You just tried to downplay Curry leading the Warriors to a title by them taking advantage of injury circumstances as if it's unusual to do so. Teams had been taking advantage of the Warriors injury circumstances in years prior, and Cleveland took full advantage of their injury circumstances in 2016.   No ofc Embiid should not have been benched. It's just telling that the 76ers had their best stretch of basketball with Simmons given the full reigns of the offense while being surrounded by four shooters who didn't stop the ball. Ofc Embiid is not easy to defend, but he is *easier* to defend than great guards are. Remember that you have to first enter the ball to Embiid in the post for him to initiate offense and then he has to work against both a great initial defender and another shadowing him for two points at a time. He's a struggling playmaker out of double teams, so he doesn't make his teammates better and he turns the ball over at an alarming rate.   Sure, Curry is an anomaly. He also possess the single most valuable skill in the NBA today - off the dribble shooting, and he just so happens to be the GOAT at it. His best season came *before* Cousins and Durant and when Draymond/Thompson were downplayed as unable to exist as stars on their own teams, so don't use that all star team spiel here. Nobody predicted the Warriors would be as good as they became in '15 and '16. As far as him being an anomaly, so are Chris Paul, James Harden and Russell Westbrook who have all pushed their teams to greater success than the bigs of today's league by no coincidence. Again, look at what Harden and Westbrook have done with relatively minimal talent around them in '15 and '17 respectively. Think Towns, Jokic, Embiid could do the same? They can't. At least not yet. Davis can and has, hes the lone exception."
Any smart coach with Lebron James is going to run a shitload of ISO. Let Lebron survey the situation and make the right decision.  Thats +EV.
I'd like to order 1 LeBron James please and gain 45k subs.
"Dude, not sure if you really read what I wrote. I agree that the Celtics play team oriented ball and that Kyrie didn't have a lot of opportunity to develop in Cleveland. I just think it's unfair to blame it all on the Cavs' coaches when it was the presence of LeBron that forced them to play that way. The current Celtics really aren't comparable roster-wise because they don't have anyone of LeBron's caliber that just forces everyone else to adjust to his strengths. What were the coaches going to do, take touches away from LeBron Freaking James and force him to play off-ball? Good luck.  I think you're making a big leap with all of that Laker's talk. LeBron is clearly chilling on championships at least somewhat, or else he would have gone to the Rockets or 6ers. Lakers have a long way to go and wouldn't be favorites even with Kawhi, as long as the Warriors resign their 4 guys."

lol What? Dirk literally lead his team against the Lebron James heat in the finals and won with a bunch of role players. What a schmuck you are
"You have to understand how much of an influence the coaching staff has on an NBA team. Lue ran an isolation offense, that is an undeniable fact. If lebron insisted on running an ISO offense and Lue disagreed entirely yet still ran ISO offense then thats on him( Lue has come out and said that coaching Lebron is actually very easy to coach so i highly doubt Lebron was running an offense that lue just didnt want), its up to the coach to make the best decision that maximizes team efficiency and the great coaches know how to get their guys to buy into an offensive system. GS has guys like Curry, Klay, Draymond and KD, all of them bought into the system that Kerr was running and all of them actually trusted what he was doing... why? because he is not only a great coach but hes great with player relationships.   Also Lebron played off the ball a ton in Miami, he can be a diva at times but eventually he'll come around because hes a very smart basketball player.  &amp;#x200B;  Walton is one of the only coaches that Lebron has played for that actually understands how to put guys in positions to be most successful and hes one of the best relationship guys in the league.   &amp;#x200B;  also your original quote "" There’s no such thing as ball movement with Lebron James on your team, that’s just how it is"" implies that no lebron team can play team ball, i said that i think the lakers will prove this sentiment wrong. if you meant only in the past tense then you have to be more specific.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;"
"&gt; ""I tried to do whatever I could do to help the kid out, be the best player that he could be.  I tried to help him be a better leader, a better scorer, a better floor general, a better defender, a better passer getting guys involved, a better vocally.

But I guess it boils down to the fact that he wasn't either getting enough credit, it wasn't happening fast enough for him so he wanted out to find it for himself or he's realizing all of this *after* the fact and that the situation wasn't ultimately that bad.  The fortunate reality for him is that he fell into an even better situation after all of that so there's no remorse over how things turned out."
"Lmao what???? There’s no such thing as ball movement with Lebron James on your team, that’s just how it is"
"73-9  The greatest team of all time?  Nope, Lebron James y'all "
"He also led the league in PER (Player Efficiency Rating) 30.6, second was Kevin Durant 27.6, 3rd Kawhi 27..6, 4th Anthony Davis 27.5, 5th James Harden 27.4, 6th LeBron James 27.0. Other metrics he led the league in: Value over replacement player, offensive box plus/minus, as well as box plus/minus, and assist percentage. Contributing to your argument though is that he had one of the highest usage rates of all time and recorded one of the all time highest missed field goals.  I don't know how Russ' rebounds would have changed playing in the 90s, I don't know of a player at the point guard position that you could objectively compare his athleticism to.  "
My Top 10 heading into the season  1. LeBron James 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kevin Durant 4. Stephen Curry 5. James Harden 6. Russell Westbrook 7. Giannis Antetokounmpo 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Chris Paul 10. Kyrie Irving  &amp;#x200B;

LeBron James to the Suns confirmed?
"07: Carried Larry Hughes to the finals against Prime Duncan/Manu/Parker  11: Lebron’s fault  14: Evenly matched team on paper, Wade+Bosh really bad in that series  15: Roster outside Lebron was JR/Delly/Shump/Mozgov/TT/James Jones  17: No one blamed Kyrie or Love. Warriors too good.  18: JR forgot the score"
"Yea I do agree but I just wonder if he is going to be able to put up the numbers to propel him into an all-star spot in a very competitive western conference with Lebron at the helm and having to take the role of playing behind him. On a side note it's awkward seeing Lebron referred to as just ""James"" haha lmao I was kinda confused at first "
It was very disputed. Kobe was losing in the first round then while Duncan was going to the Finals and one occasion meeting up with Lebron James. Lebron was 2nd in MVP voting in 2006 to Steve Nash.
Jordan had no competition greater than Lebron James. That's not recency bias.
"Yeah Eric Bledsoe, PJ Tucker, and Tyson Chandler are really college players. True franchise players like Derrick Rose, Kevin Garnett, or Lebron James would win MVP and 60 games with that cast."
Imagine having LeBron James on your team and being worried about it lmao
Yea but when you have the ball less because the dude with the ball is LeBron James it sure as hell opens of a lot of opportunity for success. 
"Michael Jordan  Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Bill Russell  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird  LeBron James  Tim Duncan  Wilt Chamberlain  Shaquille O'Neal  Hakeem Olajuwon  &amp;#x200B;  In order. Since I already know people are gonna ask ""where's Kobe?"". He's #12, behind Isiah Thomas."
HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT!!!!!!  Thibs reportedly is asking for LeBron James in trade discussions with Miami.  Miami is currently reluctant to agree to trade a player they haven't had on the roster for the past few years.  Stay tuned for more updates.
"You're not comparing 40 year old Malone and slow as fuck Steve Nash to LeBron James on his prime, come on now"
"I'm from the UK, started following the Lakers in 05-06.  People will tell you pick an east coast team but with the NBA it doesn't really matter they're pretty much all night games ""their"" time so even with an east coast team you're looking at a midnight start most games. West coast games you'll have no chance, some Laker games don't start until 3/4am over here.   Torrents and replay streaming is to the point now where if you don't read any sports news you can avoid the result and just watch it the next day anyway. So yeah as a Laker fan it kind of sucks there is literally only 2 or 3 games a season I can watch live but thems the breaks. Coincidentally if you decide to follow NFL or MLB then definitely pick an east coast team and you can actually get to watch them fairly regularly live.  Use r/nbastreams in fact use reddit for all your streams. Makes no sense at all paying for league pass.  LeBron James does own shares in the red shite if that makes it easier for you to pick the Lakers but tbh all I did was pick a player I liked and followed that team (Kobe).   It's a pretty great time to be getting into the sport as there are a lot of entertaining teams around. Even though I hate them the Celtics and 76ers are entertaining to follow and are on the uptick. The Lakers (though I'm biased) will be entertaining to follow this year; best player in the league, some interesting vets and young players, hard to say if they'll win 50 or scrape the 8th seed but it will be fun finding out.   Wouldn't recommend following the Warriors or to an extent the Rockets; that's basically like signing on to be a Barca or Real Madrid fan. You'll watch them win 65 games and waltz to the finals because they've got 4 top level guys starting (possibly 5 but the jury is out until he returns from an Achilles injury that typically ruins NBA players)  As you're a red shite, I'd say your current NBA counterpart is probably the Celtics. Lots of talent, very well coached/managed/ran and they will be contenders unless one of their stars gets injured which has been known to happen. 2 definite ""star"" players in Irving and Hayward and some incredible young players they just drafted.  The dude saying a Laker fan now would be considered a ""plastic"" isn't really right; the Lakers have sucked badly for about the last 5 years. I'm not talking like Man United ""used to be good but now have to settle for the Europa League"" I mean it's like if after Fergie left United and United proceeded to entirely forget how to play football. I mean that is basically what happened to United but I digress. Besides of which fuck the idea of ""plastic"" fanhood since you're probably never going to see them in person anyway. Shit in 13 years of fandom I've spoken to maybe 4 people over here who actually know about the sport on any level of depth.   I don't know of any UK fans dedicated to watch every game, not sure there is too many US fans that do that either. When I started out I watched highlights on youtube quite religiously. [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) did top 10 plays of the day that helped me keep up too. The Starters is a brilliant show to get a league wide view of the sport that isn't biased and keeps it light/relatively simple.  In terms of importance because of the playoff format for the championship I wouldn't say many regular season games are ""more important"" than others. There are games against rivals of course and if you follow a good team it's usually pretty big to watch them play against another good team. There's 82 games though so it's hard to say any one game is huge until the end of the season if you're chasing a playoff spot or trying to move up. Come the playoffs however every single game matters, a lot and not just in your teams series but every single other series because you want to see who you could be playing in the future.  Video games are the best way for you to learn right now. Go get 2k18 because it will be £20 instead of 2k19's £60. You can just use custom rosters that update the teams to this years and you aren't a big enough fan yet to care about the cosmetic changes 2k19 offers. Play that a little bit and see what grabs you and then follow them. Definitely stick with it though, I think the NBA is definitely the most accessible of the US sports and probably my favorite. The yanks do sports right for sure. "
"I support Liverpool and my team in the NBA’s is Miami. They used to have a link with Miami as lebron James bought shares in the team. That’s not the reason I like Miami, but it’s a link if their ever was one.  Also Miami is a well run organisation and franchise. They play hard. Are always competitive. And they have a nice recent history. And like Liverpool they play hard and fast, and also Dwayne Wade is like the Steven gerrard of Miami. He’s the reason I started supporting the heatles.  As far as where to start with the nba I recommend watching YouTube and buying nba 2k. "
"When people compare Westbrook to Steph, I just tell them to look at the shooting percentages. Then they tell me “ but Westbrook has way better stats” I then tell them to look at the usage percentage and turnover rate. Steph is in a different league to every other player not named Lebron James and Kevin Durant. "
You realize you have Lebron James on your team now right? 
"&gt;What team should I support?  My advice would be to not do the whole Liverpool-NBA connection thing. Why tie your allegiances to some rich guy or ownership group. However, LeBron James owns a stake in Liverpool and he plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, so if you want to choose a team to support that way it is a pretty clear connection. Just as a heads up, the Lakers are one of the more hated teams in the league and a lot of their fanbase would be considered ""plastics,"" in the European football lexicon.   That decision is up to you though, I guess I'd say to figure out what interest you about a team. Do you want to cheer for wins/glamour/etc., pick Golden State, Boston, Houston, LA Lakers, or Philadelphia. I'm probably missing one or two. If you want to be unique but still choose a good team, the Toronto Raptors and Utah Jazz aren't ultra popular, but will likely have successful seasons and a bright future. Some lower tier, but still good (likely playoff squads) and fun to watch teams are Oklahoma City, New Orleans (shameless plug), Denver, Portland, Washington, and Milwaukee. There are a few others but I'm not going to go through and list every team in the league.  There's value in supporting a team that's bad right now, but since you seem to be a new fan to the game of basketball I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. It is, however, fun to watch young players on a bad team develop, and start to see glimpses of what they could hopefully become in the future.   At the end of the day it's your decision, but generally people will watch their favorite team's games and a handful of games played between the best teams in the league. Basketball die-hards will watch two bad teams play to see how young players are developing and follow other technical minutiae of how those teams play, so that is an option if you're interested in thinking about and following the game in a more analytical way.

"Others have said this, its more about effort and an aggressive attitude more than anything else. He is so laid back and he rarely gets angry or shows a ton of emotion. That makes people think he doesn't put in effort, when in reality he does. Wiggins is definitely not living up to his hype, but the shit I just read from these other comments is just ridiculous.   ""Some people are just content with being average instead of striving to be the best version of themselves"" This is said about a basketball player who is one of the most athletic in the NBA, who can drive past most other players in the NBA. He is legitimately one of the best at doing a post spin move ever, absolutely doesn't have the finishing or handles, but that is improving.   ""He's lazy, doesn't hustle back on defense, his heart isn't in his plays, gives up easily, is beaten out by players with inferior physical skills, but more dedicated drives."" LOL, Wiggins is almost always the first back on defense and is one of the Wolves best defenders. This is the same r/nba circlejerk bullshit that gets repeated over and over until people believe it. Wiggins historically is a negative defender, since the second half of last year he has become a positive man defender, just watch him play and its pretty obvious.   ""When you watch some guys you can tell they are their just for a paycheck , i don’t watch Wiggins so idk if that’s the case but i think that’s what they mean"" I dont watch Wiggins but I'll throw out my opinion. Worthless.  ""It means he doesn't put in the time like a Curry or LeBron. Those guys' lives are dedicated to their bodies and spending every bit of time they can to improve and get an edge. That is the gold standard of professionalism in the NBA, and every player will be held up and compared to guys like that when it comes to work ethic."" Classic case of causation vs. correlation, just because Curry and Lebron are amazing doesn't mean they train more than others or ""put in the time."" Wiggins is making over $30 million a year, if you are accusing him of not practicing you better have stats to back up your claims or admit this is bullshit you spewed cause you were bored browsing r/nba like me.   ""He doesn't really apply himself"" Same can be said about this comment.   ""He's a draft bust going after money. I would be okay if he was something like Carmelo or Dwight Howard that he had actual decent skill to back up the want for serious cash."" Has Wiggins lived up to his potential or his hype? No, I don't think many people would claim that. But is he a bust? Hell no, he is becoming an above average all around defender and we are all hoping his shot continues to improve. Besides that, ""At 22 years and 349 days, Wiggins is the sixth-youngest player to hit that mark (6,000 career points). Those quicker than him were LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady. All Hall of Famers and certainly not bad company.""   So many of you make this case that Wiggins is undeserving of even playing in the NBA, that the Wolves should just start Tyus instead, or some bullshit like that. It honestly makes me think that many of you have never played basketball in your life. Im not talking college or even high school, like you never even shot hoops with friends or played a pickup game. If you have you would know that the freakish athleticism that Wiggins displays every single game is deserving of patience and makes his potential so much more than average.   I hope you all get someone in your life who judges you as you judge Wiggins.   "
So basically LeBron James on defense I see
"Oh no, DLo is making us feel so bad, I wish we could trade back Josh Hart and LeBron James for him! "
LeBron James III and probably IV. It will take quite a few generations of having children with mediocrely athletic women before you have a LBJ descendant that isn't good enough to get drafted.
ESPN: Why isn't Lebron James like Steph Curry? Upvotes to the left
"James Johnson.  Good facilitator, can make his way to the rim off the dribble, decent defence and shooting.  Very much a poor mans Lebron"

Rumor has it Jordan Crawford dunked on Lebron James at this game
"“C’mere Bron!” coach Lue said in the Cavs’ post-game locker room Sunday. “Bron Money!” Jr Smith Peppers shouted as James made his way to the middle of the room, next to Lue, who wanted to give LeBron the game ball."
"Yeah people hype the shit of the lakers too much. This guys are young and don't have a lot of playoff experience. Rondo, Lance, Lebron, Javale lineup is a disaster. No shooting/spacing. Opponents will let them shoot 3s as much as they want as long as they clog the paint to stop lebron james."
"Ball told James, ""Bron, I got this, relax,"" in a disarming manner. Lebron happily stepped back, Lonzo called the starters over, coached them up himself and then air-balled on 3 straight possessions."

"Eric Gordon is an absolute bull dog. HE has a reputation of playing no defense from his time in NOP which at the time was fine but he's come along way since he's decided to give a shit on that end.   His off ball defense is still questionable but as an on ball defender he's a legitimate above average defender.   They would ask him to be able ot take on anybody for stretches of time, from 1's all the way to [LeBron James](https://on.nba.com/2O9eL5s). There was a game in particular in late March vs Detroit and Blake Griffin where they asked him time and time again to switch onto him and he [did every time and held up well](https://on.nba.com/2OdnHXK). In the playoffs [him on Kevin Durant ended up being a total non issue](https://on.nba.com/2Obxvl5)  One of the biggest reasons Hou's switching scheme works is because of how many guards they have who are quite comfortable routinely having to take on bigger players. They aren't mismatches.  "

"Don't get me wrong, I think very highly of Ingram (though with him, I personally don't see a consistent super star rather than a ceiling of an all star at best).  But the sports world is so much about timing and superstars.  I get it, to some extent, you can try to punt this season if you think Boogie will come back and be the guy that he used to be.  The Warriors will truly be unstoppable, but only for this single season.  That being said, you just acquired the greatest player in the game at the tail end of his prime years (which at his age is already absurd).  You HAVE to go all in.  You don't get LeBron James to let him ride into the sunset as your young guys hopefully become the next big things."
"Everybody knows Harden is a stat padder, his career playoff stats are terrible for a supposedly ""elite"" offensive player.    42% from 2, 32% from, 5.5 AST, 3.3 turnovers    Leonard actually elevates his game in the playoffs, you're talking about him like he hasn't already won a ring and Finals MVP against James, or won 2 DPOY's.  Lead his team to 61 wins without another all star and a franchise best 67 wins with Aldridge playing like crap.    Pop had Leonard on KD and he was thoroughly outplaying him lol, Pop's rotations were idiotic he kept subbing Leonard out for Anderson early while KD was still on the court and in those few mins KD dominated.  Pop gets all the credit but he's been badly out coached in multiple playoff series.     Lebron touched the ball 73 times in Game 3 but only attempted 14 shots.  Only 17% of Lebron's total touches resulted in a FG attempt against Leonard.  Lebron attacked Leonard teammates twice as much as when guarded by Leonard and did the majority of his scoring on them.  If you touch the ball 73 times and only convert on 14 that means 59 of those possessions were not what the Heat wanted.  Leonard holding Lebron scoreless for entire quarters at a time or forcing Lebron to pass it to a teammate for a highly contested jumper is not going to show up on the stat sheet but it did in the scores.  The Heat barely put up 95, 98, 92, 86, 87 they didn't break 100pts the entire series.  That is a direct result of Leonard interrupting their offensive sets making their screens, decoys, etc. go absolutely nowhere.  When the Spurs were destroying GS in the playoffs they were playing exactly how they did during their ""beautiful game"" which has only ever appeared when Leonard was on the roster.  "
"Kuzma yelled ""tamper this dick"", Lonzo gave a look that didn't make most people want to punch him and his whole family into the abyss, Lance belted ""Imma stay on a team more than 2 years!"" and before Lebron james hit the locker room floor, ex-NBA star Kobe Bryant hugged him and said ""y'all look so different"""

"""*Great pass! I'm coming near you, Lance, just don't blow in my ear.*"" - LeBron James"
lmao a team with Lebron James is getting carried by Lance and Javale McGee in the 4th quarter. 45's election flung us into the most ridiculous timeline.
He is their tank commander. Gotta get another number 1 pick this year to draft the next Lebron James.
Kobe Bryant fans said he would NEVER miss a pre game dunk like LeBron James. Here’s 10 times he did.  *10k upvotes*
"""*Nah, I getting on that poster.*"" - Lebron James "
"I mean, the obvious comparison is Oscar Robertson.  He got a ring with young Kareem later in his career, though.  Conclusion: Westbrook is gonna team up with LeBron James Jr. to win a ring in 2024."
Lakers star Lebron James is steaming. Pacing. Screaming. Took a Rajon Rondo and slammed it into the court.
Just FYI lebron was shooting better from 30+ feet last year than everyone else in the NBA. [Here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/) is a link to a 538 article that goes over this sample. He's done this pretty regularly
"He has all the tools to be a world class point guard. But I've always suspected he really wants to be a 6'3"" LeBron James."

"There is exactly one player in the league that has the green light to take 30 footers with 20 seconds left on the shot clock, and LeBron James is not on that list"
"he has played there a decent amount and will even more for the Lakers. even then,  in the modern nba, 1-5 positions are somewhat meaningless for many teams, so its not always clear.   on cavs radio intros last year, where starters would give their name-number-position, lebron would say “Lebron James, number 23... every position” lol"
LeBron James drinks Sprite
Here to see a generational talent face off against LeBron James
""" A 23 year old Lebron James finished 4th in voting this year. He received 1 first place vote and led his Cavs to 45 wins---an amazing feat considering his team at the point in time. Lebron posted an impressive 30/7.9/7.2, but 45 wins won't get you much more than 4th place in MVP votes. ""  &amp;#x200B;  What a shitty argument. If he played better, he should be mvp, period."
"Father time is undefeated...  Lebron James season average so far 25 pts, 9 assists, 8 rebounds  LOL"
"The story is writing itself, Cavs will get 3 number one picks. They will select RJ Barrett in 2019, James Wiseman in 2020, and then they will shut down the two in the 2022-23 season to tank for the first overall pick so they can draft LeBron James Jr. in 2023 as he will graduate by then (assuming one-and-done is repealed). LeBron Sr.'s contract with the Lakers will have expired by 2022; he will re-sign on a 1+1 and then opt out to sign with the Cavs in 2023 after his son is drafted. The Cavaliers will then defeat the Warriors in the 2024 NBA Finals, ending their streak of 7 consecutive championships."
Why not? You don't know Lebron James people need to stop acting like they know what he thinks.

"Steph Curry was the catalyst and cornerstone for taking the league's most consistently bad franchise to a championship dynasty.  Stockton on the Warriors isn't getting us a ring. Only Curry and LeBron James have taken historically-consistently-awful teams to a championship, and Curry stayed a Warrior the whole time - LeBron had to bail for four years while the Cavs got another three *number one* picks. Curry got us there with a #11 and a bunch of players other teams didn't want.  Stockton hung around longer, big whoop."
"I disagree there. I think Lonzo should have the ball in his hands more than LeBron, and we need him as a playmaker more than as a shooter. Although how we are playing is using him greatly, I don't think him handling the ball less is a benefit, but I do hope he can adjust and keep making shots.   And obviously is better for the team that James has the ball in his hands all the time, but Lonzo is more important as a point guard than as a shooting guard. Similar to how even if Durant or Green can Handle the ball for the Warriors, it's preferable that Curry has it in his hands"
"The hell are you looking at? You looking at the 2018-2019 seasons where there are only 5 game samples? Lmao your intellligence is pretty lacking. No one averages 4 FTA over 82 games, James Harden had a huge outlier season last year and still had the #1 FTA at 3.8. Go look at any other season with 82 game sample sizes SMH.   Even in the 2017-2018 regular season Butler is driving 12.1 times a game and getting 2.1 drives off of those. That's insignificantly better than LeBron at 11.7 drives, 1.9 attempts.   Go look at the post season where it ACTUALLY matters. 18.5 drivers per game with 2.6 FTA per drive. That is WAY higher than anyone on that list, including the flop artist James Harden. And take into consideration LeBron initiates the contact and makes offensive fouls in the first place. This dude wouldn't average 25 points without his precious free throws. What a LeBron homer you are. "
And yet the heat dismantled the bulls that year in the playoffs behind a legendary defensive performance by lebron james. 
"Lebron is an oddity. On one hand he gets away with traveling more than anyone but James Harden. On the other, he should go to the line way more than he does, but he's so strong that what should be fouls are no calls because they don't affect him."
"Michael Jordan could build a fucking city in less time than what James did with the school, you're all just kiddie LeBron Stans who don't know basketball like how I know basketball.  /s"
"My take is that LeBron James has been the best basketball player the last decade. Whether or not he was the most valuable player that year is debatable, but he was always #1 (except maybe Steph in 15-16)"
People seriously think LeBron James is missing the playoffs? 
"Yes  He sucks, he will probably max get MLE next year, he should be happy Lakers had to give him these big contracts  the last years because of Rich Paul and LeBron James. "
When people say this I interpret it as they’re literally saying who’s the most valuable player not who had the best regular season.

"Let's see what his stats are at the all-star break. But he's going to improve this year with his rookie-season under his belt and Lebron James on his team.    Ball is often compared to Jason Kidd, and Kidd never got close to 50/40/80 at any point in his career. So I can't see Ball being that efficient in his second year in the league.  "

"In 2009 LeBron led the Cavs to the first seed with 61 wins and the next year when he left to Miami they had 19 wins. Consequently the Heat were a fifth seed team with 47 wins who got bounced in the first round however when LeBron joined they were a 58 win second seed who made the finals.   In 2014 the Heat were a second seed with 54 wins who made the finals and the next year when LeBron left they were a tenth seed who only managed 37 wins. LeBron joined a Cavs team who were 33-49 and a tenth seed, the subsequent season they were a second seed who were 53-29 who again made the finals.  In 2018 LeBron led arguably one of the worst supporting casts ever to a fourth seed with a record of 50-32 and you guessed it made the finals. After leaving to join the Lakers the Cavs have started 0-4 and look set to get a top lottery pick this year.   Never underestimate LeBron James. "

"Kawhi's post up game is on the level of MJ, he has the highest true shooting % in the playoffs even ahead of Lebron, he finished with the 2nd highest Offensive Real Plus Minus only behind James in the 15-16 season, his mid range game is one of the best ever, he can score from all around the court, his fade-away jumper is money, he can grill you with 3 balls, etc.  Harden's offense isn't that much better than Leonard's, he just takes a ton of shots.    Harden was taking 22.6 shots to score 28ppg last year's playoffs while Leonard was taking 16.8 to score 27ppg, yeah I'm taking Leonard.  Efficiency wise Leonard blows Harden out of the water, play making goes to Harden but he averages practically half as many TO's as assists in the playoffs throughout his career.  When you step back and examine Harden's playoff stats they're simply not that great compared to Leonard who elevates his game."

All it does is disprove the initial blanket claim that he was clutch to an impossible degree.

Plays D too.  As for the *""How will we stop him when we can't hack him?!?!?""* thing?

counterpoint: Lebron James
"According to the NBA (and this is what this thread is about), because the Hawks called an immediate timeout, all that time hanging there was during a dead ball, and thus was irrelevant. The refs did not think he was taunting, nor impeding the flow of play, nor delaying the game, so no tech was warranted. This is from [the Last 2 Minute report from last night:](https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/11/L2M-ATL-LAL-11-11-2018-002.pdf)  &gt; 00:15.8 Foul: Hanging Technical LeBron James **CNC**   &gt; After the made dunk shot, James (LAL) remains on the rim after the timeout is called and players have cleared the area under the rim. **The ball is dead and he is not taunting opponents or delaying the game.**"

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Carmelo. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Melo in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the third greatest SF ever, and one of the 25 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that Robert Covington is better than Melo, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Melo in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Melo is better. You might be jealous of Melos medals, or jealous of his status as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Nuggets fan who watched basketball in the 00s, or a Knicks fan who watched basketball in the 2010s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Melo isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Melo talk to the adults. Fair? "

"&gt; I don’t think it’s taunting or malicious in nature.  That's really all that matters as far as the NBA is concerned, and FWIW they agreed with you and that's why he wasn't T'd up. Being excited or trying to amp up the crowd doesn't get you a technical, but taunting the other team does. This is from [the Last 2 Minute report from last night:](https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/11/L2M-ATL-LAL-11-11-2018-002.pdf)  &gt; 00:15.8 Foul: Hanging Technical LeBron James **CNC**   &gt; After the made dunk shot, James (LAL) remains on the rim after the timeout is called and players have cleared the area under the rim. **The ball is dead and he is not taunting opponents or delaying the game.**"
"This obviously shouldn't have been a tech, but I don't get the part about them saying a technical foul wasn't called because of the dead ball.  There are literally dead ball technical fouls called every single night in the NBA. In fact, the majority of technical fouls called are during dead balls.  Again, not saying this should have been a tech, but dead ball bit doesn't make sense.

"I didn't copy and paste even one comment in this thread. I commented a bunch of times, but they were all unique comments, I didn't just spam the thread with the same incorrect statement over and over like you did. And that link I posted in my above comment is from the NBA's own website explaining why it's a technical. You'll notice that there is *nothing* there about ""damaging the rims."" There are different rules about if a player damages the rim or backboard (they don't have to hang on the rims for this to happen), and it causes a delay then the player can be assessed a non-unsportsmanlike technical, but that is not what this is all about.   LeBron did *not* damage the rim, so that part of the rulebook is irrelevant. Same goes for causing a delay of game, as the Hawks immediately called a timeout as soon as LeBron hit that shot, so this thing you've been spamming everywhere in this thread is irrelevant to this situation. It came down to whether he was considered to be taunting or not, and the refs deemed that he was not, so they didn't call a technical. This is from [the Last 2 Minute report from last night:](https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/11/L2M-ATL-LAL-11-11-2018-002.pdf)  &gt; 00:15.8 Foul: Hanging Technical LeBron James **CNC**   &gt; After the made dunk shot, James (LAL) remains on the rim after the timeout is called and players have cleared the area under the rim.

I didn't think he'd be the best scorer on a team with Lebron, but I figured he'd have a Jamal Murray-esque season and feast off a star. He's setting guys up at less than half the rate he did last year, so I'm not sure why it would be controversial to have assume that he'd be scoring more. If I asked you before the season started that, through ten games or so, he'd be averaging less points on lower efficiency than last year, you'd probably have thought I was being overly pessimistic, right?  &gt;Impossible to say about a 21 year old  What does his age have to do with roster construction? There's less playmaking opportunities with Lebron and Rondo on board, to say nothing of Ingram's playmaking struggles so far this year. He'll get better, but he'll obviously get less ballhandling duties while he plays in the starting lineup. *So anyway to the point I was making, I think it's extremely unlikely he'll get to 22ppg playing with Lebron unless he starts taking different kinds of shots, and more of them.

It's also an act of evil for the purpose of being evil, but I think society has lost touch with evil as a real thing so maybe we're just collectively unprepared to discuss these acts if we deny something like evil exists.  If fame-seeking is a cause then the continued focus on the shootings may result in a raise in them or a rise in attempts at the least.  However, that's a real examination of the issue. What Lebron said was dumb and likely influenced by the media he interacts with. It continues to be safer and safer to be born in the post-industrial world. Violent crime was higher in his childhood. Despite the recent event, we have to parse a blip in the pattern from the overall pattern.  In James' defense, negative information outweighs positive info in the human mind, so we emphasize these sort of things without fully realizing it. Yet if people were truly concerned about these events then they'd take a moment to understand them. What the NBA has done is just empty virtue signaling that may backfire once we better understand the psychology. It's irresponsible to me, but nobody in the press will examine the issue and hold the NBA accountable. (Which is probably what mostly irks and divides the country currently, random authority without accountability.)"
In the playoffs it's going to be my Lakers led by the one and only LeBron James.  
"LeBron ""Garbage"" James."
"I was born and raised in Thousand Oaks and just moved out of state in 2017.  This has to be one of the most surreal aspects of everything that has happened this past week.  Seeing the team that I have rooted for since 1994 talk about my hometown because of a shooting.  And to have that person be Lebron James, who before July I said would never join the Lakers.  This is so weird."
"This is all good in theory, but let's look at the real world results.  The Sixers have made the second round once, and currently look like the 4th best team in the East. They have some development to look forward to, as well as the addition of Jimmy, but are they really a contender? I'd say no, not for the next 2 years of Toronto remaining elite.  The Celtics made the ECF (and got murdered) with a team that was basically a bunch of savvy trades and shit (I negative impact) performances from James Young and Jaylen Brown (Nets picks 1&amp;2). Sure, we are where we are today because of the Nets picks getting us kyrie, but it's not unreasonable to think that if IT didn't lose his hip we'd have done better against the Cavs, or kept him and still put together a great team of IT, Al, and [MAX FREE AGENT].  The Lakers basically have 2 young players that (sorry) look like they could at best become a bunch of fringe all-stars if all goes to plan. Lonzo just can't score, Ingram has spent 3 years with some of the best experts in the world trying to gain weight (and is still skinny as a toothpick), Kuzma is a good role player, and Hart is a good role player too. Y'all added the best player in the world and 12 games in you're not looking like a contender. Now, it's still early in the season, but I don't think it's ridiculous to say that no one expects the Lakers in the WCF. LeBron is getting older too and who knows when he'll start to decline. Right now the Lakers look like a mediocre team for the near future.    Now, none of these teams are in a bad spot, but compared to a team like Toronto or San Antonio that has refused to tank, can we say we're much better off?"
"I disagree with that too.  Just because he needs the ball in his hands to be at peak effectiveness does not mean he has to have it in his hands at all times.  The easiest and most clear cut example I have is Lebron James on the Heat.  He's also by far more effective with the ball in his hands, but they let Wade get his possessions too.  Wade also liked the ball in his hands but his cutting made him really good off-ball too.  But you can have two guys who are great with the ball in their hands because one guy can't run every possession.  It takes too much energy.  Having multiple guys able to get theirs is fantastic.  Look at Steph and KD.  And the third member of the Big 3 would have to be a big who doesn't need the ball in his hands.  Preferably a down low presence, who can also space and play great defense.  So although Derozan may not be the best person to include in a big 3, he's not useless and can still be a part of a contender as one third of a big 3."
"Perhaps he's being real about himself after this year+ away from LeBron, realizing that it's not something everyone can do just because they're 'the guy' on a team. Or it could be that as someone else noted he's not just talking about being 'the guy' but also having glue guys in the locker room like James Jones, RJ, Korver, and guys like that(DWest for those Warriors squads another good example). It's one thing to have 'a leader' and another thing to have 'veteran leadership' and maybe Kyrie's take on their lockerroom is that him and Al need more voices for all these young kids to learn from."
&gt;Was he Lebron James?  FTFY
on Lebron James
"The WNBA is terrible and will not improve in viewership unless some phenomena comes through a la Lebron James and totally dominates. Other than that, it is a failed product on its own. No one is arguing that.  But like I said, the league is willing to pay $10 million dollars to make it so that girls have the opportunity to go pro and all the good PR that comes with being inclusive. The WNBA is its own league, sure, but in regards to the NBA and it's decision to continue investing in it, it is more of a PR program. "
LeBron James Jr. ^^^4?
They drafting LeBron James Jr. Jr. Jr. Jr. next century as well probably
What would that franchise ever have to speak for if LeBron Raymone James Sr. wasn't born in its vicinity?
"Lets not forget probably the greatest stat in basketball history: No player has ever led both teams in all five major stats throughout an entire playoff series, regardless of round or number of games.  Except LeBron James in the 7-game 2016 NBA Finals against the greatest regular season team of all time led by the only unanimous MVP in NBA history."
I wouldn’t want to have a young player like Simmons as the leader of my team over LeBron James lol. If any player in the league fits the championship window on that lakers team it’s LeBron. If you want to take the reigning rookie of the year over one of the goats to ever play the game of basketball then that’s your choice lol
"because going into the season Laker fans chest thumped and proclaimed that ""Lebron James makes every one around him better"" and that hasn't been the case with BI. "
"&gt; Chandler described the pair as “two kids jumping for joy.” When he was asked what James said to him in that moment, the four-time MVP piped up from across the locker room and yelled, “I said, ‘That’s my dawg! That’s my dawg!’”   I'm starting to think LeBron will be an Italian-specialized chef with all the pastas he's been producing for the last 5 years"
Even Lebron found it helpful to have guys like James Jones and Richard Jefferson in his locker room.
"Tyson is the perfect center for LeBron.. If only he was on his side in that 2011 Finals maybe we should have seen an helluva ride by James and his squad. Now they are finally togheter on the same team, even if they met in middle 30s, they both share that old school vision of basketball so important to extend to youngers. They are dads of this young fast and atlethic team"
"Yea the context being ""it's LeBron fucking James"""
Yes.  Proof: LeBron Raymone James
"Lebron ""Lebron James"" James"
LeBron. James.
"The short answer: Lebron  The long answer: Lebron ""Lebron ""fucking"" James"" James."
BUT MICHAEL JEFFERY JORDAN WOULD NEVER HAVE CRUMBLED LIKE THE CHOSEN ONE TURNED FROZEN ONE LEBRON JAMES WHEN HE MISSED THOSE TWO FREE THROWS.
"""I'll suck garbage for free right now."" -LeBron James"

Remember when people were saying Lebron might go to the suns because of the James Jones connection?  Lol
"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/10/lebron-james-shocking-free-throw-stat  LeBron has SUCKED at FT’s in the clutch for over a year now.  It has nothing to do with him being bad at FT’s.  He is literally shooting more than 25% worse at them in the clutch.  So yeah, it’s clearly a problem, you need to relax."
He's LeBron fucking James.
James Jones did Lebron a solid tbh as a suns fan I hope we don’t keep him. Why buyout out someone knowing he will go to a team that we compete against in our own division. 
“I suck”  -Lebron “oral goat” James 
"I have no idea what you mean by that, hanging on the rim is allowed during a dead ball but being unsportsmanlike and raising your feet like Draymond did isn't.  I'm glad you think you know more about basketball rules than Lebron James and the three refs that were there tonight. I'm sure you'll make it some day."
"“I’m garbage. Yeah, I suck”  -LeBron James  Seems good to me"
"Not in shambles because he was complete dogshit on the Suns.  But I don't blame him honestly.  Dumpster fire of an organization.  I am ""glad"" though that Suns GM James Jones got to do his buddy LeBron a solid."
You are linking me a more summarized version of the rules I already showed you. During the game does not mean from tip-off to the end of the 4th quarter. Timeouts are a PAUSE in the game. The game is not on.  &amp;#x200B;  Do you really think you know more about basketball rules than Lebron fricking James and the 3 refs that were there?  Edit: Spelling.
"Seeing as this is largely the same roster as last year, that went to the finals and swept the Toronto Raptors, do not even try and tell me that Lebron James isn't one of the GOATs"
"Lebron is a two time champion. Duncan choked in game 6, but got his revenge and won the following year with the Spurs future: Kawaii Leonard. Lebron goes back to Cleveland afterwards, and he also got Kevin Love on the team.  Lakers rookie D'Angelo Russell exposes Nick Young's adultery.  Kobe retired and dropped 60 points his last game. he has won an Oscar for a short film: Dear Basketball.  the Warriors broke the Bulls regular season record. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are a god tier shooters. however, they almost lost to the Thunder in the WCF falling 3-1 but OKC isn't affectionately called Chokelahoma City Blunder for nothing.  that same year Lebron James made the impossible possible by overcoming a 3-1 deficit and defeated that same Warriors team in the Finals to bring Cleveland's first title. Clevelanders were so happy one of them LITERALLY ATE HORSE SHIT OFF THE TARMAC.  the Warriors got KD and they proceeded to set things right... from their perspective. KD is now universally hated and gets into arguments with random strangers on Twitter, Instagram and Omeagle.  Skip Bayless left Stephen A to form his own hot takes show titled SKEEEEEEUP. Woj works for BS-- I mean, ESPN.  Jimmy Butler is traded to the Wolves, who is coached(so far) by Tom Thibbodeu.  CP3 left the LA Clippers to join James Har\_en and Eric Gordon in Houston. almost beat the Warriors last year before a. the Warriors turned it on; b. CP3 got injured; and c. Har\_en choked.  Lebron is now a Laker and Magic Johnson(who recently became Lakers President) surrounded him with all his old enemies to form a meme team.  Jimmy Butler released a single titled: ""You bleeping Need Me!"" it's a ballad song he composed while handing the Wolves starters their ass with third stringers.  Derrick Rose dropped 50 fucking points.  watch Bleachreport's Game of Zones, OP."
"Yeah according to a L2M report [here](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-golden-state-warriors-christmas-technical-foul-hanging-rim-richard-jefferson-trip-last-two-minute-122816) it's still a T if you hang on the rim after a foul call, maybe a TO call is different idk. "
"Fair, cheers, here's a weird one though, L2M says LeBron should have gotten a T for hanging after an and-1 call [here](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-golden-state-warriors-christmas-technical-foul-hanging-rim-richard-jefferson-trip-last-two-minute-122816). Is it still ""during the game"" when a whistle has gone to call a foul? "
i swear to god people on reddit have never lifted weights or done anything athletic before.  have they never done a lifting routine? or a weight loss plan? you never progress in a straight line up and to the right. its a tumbling up and down circular pattern there. takes time and lots of patience! not every player is lebron james or tim duncan
We all know the real reason a technical wasn't called was because Lebron James did it. Dwight Howard was given a technical foul after hanging on to the rim too (timeout was called as well).
Everyone saying LeBron deserves a tech for hanging on the rim an extra couple of seconds.   LeBron could build a house and move in there and no one would say a damn thing. It's god damn LeBron James he's probably spent more time above the rim then you do pooping.      
A Lebron James?
"-Lebron won 2 rings and 2 MVP's in Miami after losing to Dallas.   -Stephen Curry won 3 rings in Golden State and 2 MVP's (and you know the KD stuff)   -Kobe Bryant retired scoring 60 in his last game.   -Russell Westbrook has averaged a triple double for the past two years.   -Also everyone is shooting 3 pointers now.          -Some of the best players in the league include Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid.   "
"Sure.  1. LeBron went back to Cleveland and won a championship over the Golden State Warriors when the Cavs came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win.  2. KD joined the Warriors two weeks after  #1 happened.  3. A man named Giannis entered the NBA. He's kind of a superstar now.  4. The Celtics traded all their star players for what turned out to be a haul of high draft picks which they used to add Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and then trade for Kyrie Irving from Cleveland.  5. Kawhi Leonard demanded a trade and went to Toronto  6. LeBron James went to the Lakers this past summer (this should be higher but w/e)  7. Chris Paul teamed up with James Harden in Houston.  8. Russell Westbrook won MVP two years ago by averaging a triple double.  9. Paul George teamed up with Westbrook in OKC.  10. The Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs are both chilling in that 5-8 range in their respective conferences."
"I wouldn’t listen to a guy drafted after me either (LeBron James 2003 # 1 pick, Luke Walton 2003 pick #32)"
"Who do you want calling plays, Lebron James or Luke Walton? 😂😂"
&gt;last name  My favorite player is James LeBron 
Lebron James
"Don't a lot of great players call plays now and then? I mean, LeBron definitely has throughout his career. It's also LeBron James; is this that bad of a thing?"
"Here, I'll add this to the OP too. Shaq was insane in the playoffs lmao. I really hope Giannis gets to go to the Finals in the next 3-4 years so we can see what sort of numbers he'd put up by comparison.

"People seemingly always expect fireworks from it, but I think it would be the total opposite. LeBron doesn't ignore coaches because he's a stubborn idiot, LeBron ignores coaches because he's god damn LeBron James and has one of the highest BBIQs of the last X decades. It's like people don't want to think about the idea that LeBron makes his team play better by doing his thing.  So linking that to Pop, now you have a great player working with arguably one of the best coaches of all time. I think they'd come to an understanding real quick and I think that, with the right players, they could even be better than the Warriors are now. "
"Because James Worthy was a small forward, and the Lakers already have LeBron at power forward. I did say they could slide LeBron to PF and play either Worthy or Elgin Baylor at SF."
"If Magic or Pelinka have any resemblance of a backbone as Pat Riley to put LeBron in his place and allow Luke Walton to run his system, then it would be really nice to have variety to our current prolific offense aka PnR and Iso three top of the key that is being freelanced by LeBron James. "
"I’m not bothered by it. LeBron has somehow always never been given a historically great coach. We’ll never look back at a Lebron team and think of a coach like Michael and Phil or Duncan and Pop. The closest he had to that was in Miami, when Erik was executing Pat Riley’s vision. David Blatt had a solid Europe career, but Lebron ran him out of town, and no one actually thinks Ty Lue did anything of note.   I mean what has Walton actually done? That winning streak in Golden State? It’s hard to tell if he was acting on his own or if he was doing what Kerr had already established, and let’s be real, that Golden State team probably could’ve won games without a coach.   And what is Walton gonna do? He’s not even a guy put in place by Magic Johnson. Lebron is locked up for four years and is the most valuable athlete on the planet. If Luke does something Lebron doesn’t like, he’ll be gone, and James will still be there.   Lebron has never really had to respect a coach. Maybe a little in Miami, but that’s about it. I think he’d respect a coach a little more if it was one installed by Magic Johnson, but Walton was put in there by a previous regime, and they just haven’t had a reason to replace him.   I’m not saying Lebron shouldn’t call the plays, because he is the team captain, and the smartest player on the court, but part of the reason Cleveland fell apart is because Lebron had too much unofficial control over the roster. They overpaid JR and Tristian because of Lebron. They brought in Wade because of Lebron. They brought in who they thought Lebron would be comfortable with. Michael didn’t have that kind of say so. The only thing he really did was threaten to retire if they went through with proposed trades of Scottie Pippen. So, I do think Lebron should let people do their jobs more. And I think he has, because in the past, I think he would’ve nixed the signings of Rondo, McGee, Beasley and Stephenson, because all of them have behavior problems, and Lebron has suggested that he rather play with classy, smarter veterans. Not saying Rondo isn’t a smart vet, because he is, but he couldn’t even make it a week into the season without getting into a fight. "
I don't think CP3 really gives a shit about a championship. The guy wanted to get paid. Otherwise he probably would have taken a paycut to go play with Kawhi and LMA on the Spurs or play with LeBron James on the Cavs when he had the chance. 
"Blake Griffin had a better rookie season than LeBron James, and certainly better than Doncic. "
Eastern All Star STARTERS (in my opinion)  PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Victor Oladipo  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Joel Embiid        Western All Star STARTERS (in my opinion)   PG: Stephen Curry (Damian Lillard in case Steph gets injured)   SG: James Harden   SF: LeBron James (pretty obvious lol)  PF: Kevin Durant   C: Anthony Davis     I can’t think of the bench players honestly because I don’t think I can think of too much players at 9 PM after I just came back from work.   
My username is not a reference to LeBron James for clarification.
Obviously. but what does that have to do with Lebron James and the nba?
"But seriously, the NBA is *literally* Pokemon.  &gt; Even though it looks different aesthetically, the NBA is functionally identical to Pokemon. &gt;  &gt; Imagine you're running an NBA team. Your quest [season] begins when the local oddball professor [NBA Commissioner] calls you in and presents you with a selection of unusual beings [players], allowing you to choose one for your team. Your rivals each pick one for themselves as well. [This is the NBA Draft.] &gt;  &gt; These unusual beings each have special abilities -- extreme [size,](https://i.imgur.com/YhuV8n8.jpg) [speed,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTWbRru8D2s) [cunning,](https://youtu.be/p6KeHZb9yso?t=4s) [unique](https://i.imgur.com/G8NNdjX.jpg) [physical](https://i.imgur.com/WpjwENr.jpg) [appearance,](https://i.imgur.com/SVRYags.jpg) etc. -- and signature moves that distinguish them from one another. [LeBron James used Chasedown Block! Jamal Crawford used Killer Crossover! Anderson Varejao used Flop! It's Super Effective!] &gt;  &gt; They also come in different [""types.""](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/analytics-basketball/) Some are rock-solid types, heavy and strong on defense but lacking in aerial skills [centers]. Others have the ability to catch fire and scorch their opponents from long range [shooting guards]. And some even have a seemingly psychic ability to anticipate the action, confuse their opponents, and move things around through sheer force of will [point guards]. &gt;  &gt; Your goal is to put together the best team of six individuals [five plus a sixth man] you can assemble, with the goal of besting your rivals' teams in a head-to-head matchup. It's up to you to train [coach] them to reach their full potential, figure out their strengths, and build a roster that balances those strengths in a way that best exploits the weak points in your opponent's roster. &gt;  &gt; Although you are given one Pokemon [player] at the start of your quest [season], you must find and catch the rest of your team in the wild [free agency] or trade with your rivals. Some types are easy to find and add to your team, but they aren't very good [benchwarmers/scrubs]. Others are better, but they're more rare [role players]. And there are a select few whose abilities are legendary, but they're the rarest of all, and getting one on your team is like catching a unicorn [superstars]. &gt;  &gt; At first it may seem clear which individuals are the best, but from time to time a lesser individual may have a breakthrough and [evolve into a totally different beast.](http://www.latimes.com/sports/nba/la-sp-nba-isaiah-thomas-20170318-story.html) This doesn't happen in every case, but with enough experience and the right trainer [coach], it is often possible. &gt;  &gt; Putting together the perfect team is a real challenge. You must travel around the country, visiting different Gyms and facing a different rival in each new city. (These Gyms are also type-themed; there is [a fire-type gym,](https://i.imgur.com/pvDZsBt.jpg) [an electric-type gym,](https://i.imgur.com/Dh3zLR7.jpg) [a flying-type gym,](https://i.imgur.com/Wcc9Tpu.png) [a leaf-type gym](https://i.imgur.com/4oJFs7S.gif) -- even [a bug-type gym.](https://i.imgur.com/k2t3FD7.jpg)) If you can't win consistently, you must reshuffle your roster and try a new approach. But in the end, if you can defeat all your rivals, you become champion and go down in history as The Very Best (Like No One Ever Was). &gt;  &gt; All of this -- being a Pokemon Master, or being a master of the NBA -- involves a lot of esoteric knowledge, and it's easy for people to become obsessed with analyzing stats, imagining hypothetical matchups, simulating ideal teams, and memorizing trivia. The aesthetics may be completely different, but the underlying framework is essentially identical. The things that cause non-sports fans to ""geek out"" over things like Pokemon or their favorite MMO are exactly the same things that cause sports fans to geek out over the NBA. &gt;  &gt; So the next time one of your self-described ""nerd"" friends says they don't ""get"" sports and don't understand why we sports fans are so addicted to playing ""armchair GM"" and fantasizing about how we'd run our favorite teams, maybe this can help explain the appeal."
Normally I'd agree but this is LeBron James we're talking about here
"The KAT thing was definitely not just this sub though.  2016-17 GM survey:  &gt;If you were starting a franchise today and could sign any player in the NBA, who would it be?  &gt;1. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota – 48.3%  &gt;2. Kevin Durant, Golden State – 20.7%  &gt;3. LeBron James, Cleveland – 17.2%"
Lebron James. He understands whats going on out there more than Luke. 
"&gt; I feel like this starting line-up (no bench) can even contend the Lakers.  lol, no. In fact I think that Sixers lineup is problematic mainly because of Iverson's presence. He was a horrible defender and a ball hog on offense, which wouldn't work well with the other guys in that lineup. You've also got Erving playing SG when he was a SF, Barkley at SF when he was a PF and Moses Malone playing PF when he was a center. It's a very strange lineup, to say the least.  The Lakers would counter with:  PG: Magic Johnson (greatest ever at this position)  SG: Kobe Bryant (2nd greatest ever at this position)  SF: LeBron James (greatest ever at this position)  PF: Pau Gasol or possibly Karl Malone?  C: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (greatest ever at this position)  To matchup with that strange Sixers lineup the Lakers could slide KAJ to PF and have Shaq play center though, I suppose. Or they could put Elgin Baylor or James Worthy in at SF and slide LeBron to PF."
"No, see thats where you're straw manning, you thought we were talking about 2014 just because OP made a hyperbolic comment about the FMVP. You were wrong we were talking about 2013 and then you decided to make the argument about Gary Neal.  Also, in discourse from time to time one uses an extreme example to illuminate a point that the other doesn't seem to be processing. (You didn't seem to think that a losing team could have any FMVP potential).You then try to debate me about Gary Neal being the same as Lebron James. That's how strawman works. "
James being Lebron. haha. Good Night!
"This is LeBron James, the best player in the league and arguably in the top 1-3 players to ever play the game. He doesn't need Luke calling plays from the sidelines. That's absurd."
"Luke Walton has no right to call a play to lebron james, let's be serious. Coach or not. James is a basketball genius. Walton is an ego manager at this point til James leaves."

"What I find a bit concerning is stuff like this:   &gt;James is averaging half as many post-ups per game as he did with the Cavs. He can't post because most of the time the Lakers are either fast breaking or relying on James to be the playmaker on offense.  I really wanna see him in the post more. Plus in an off-season like this   (it is) I would like to see the young guys take on even more responsibility. Although on the other hand playoff experience would be crucial, too, and with LeBron not leading the team in Rondo's absence they might be difficult to reach. "
"Yeah, just at the last paragraph of the article  &gt;Bottom line, things are trending more positively for the Lakers. James getting back into his comfort zone, whether it was in the original game plan or not, is helping.  The headline without context makes it sound like there Walton and James clashed or LeBron is walking over Walton"
Do you want LeBron James or Luke Walton calling plays for your offense? Serious question.
"&gt;Magic doesn't have urgency to win, when he has a 34 year old LeBron James on his team.  This was true 2 months ago. And there was no urgency. What has changed?"

"Team USA Olympic team in 2020.  I'm really hoping all of the United States stars show out to send off Pop into the sunset.  I mean, barring bad injuries a starting 5 could be...  PG - Wardell Curry II SG - James Harden Jr. SF - Kevin Durant PF - LeBron James Sr. C - Anthony Davis Jr."
"Ever since Lebron James that shit has gone back to 5th grade (does it go earlier now? That seems *too* crazy, even with how far the goal posts have shifted)."

"I mean for future AMAs, if you guys can, pretty please....  LeBron James 🙏  Edit: Barring that option if it's difficult, I feel like Embiid or KAT would do an AMA here. They have a great social media presence"
"Apparently Russ hasn't earned that trust in OKC because it's being reported in the link you yourself provided that Westbrook is still ignoring Billy Donovan in his 4th year under him as coach. LeBron, meanwhile, is in his first 20 games under Luke Walton, and even the OP's quote says that they had a small adjustment period but have already figured it out:  &gt; Walton has adjusted, and now when James is running the show, Walton will typically just let him call the game.  The difference is Walton is smart to let LeBron call the game, while Donovan is also smart when he doesn't think Westbrook should be doing the same. That's how you end up with a sub 30% 3-pt shooter like Russ taking 12 threes in a game like he did the other night, or **19**(!!), like he did in the game that got the Thunder eliminated last season."
Don’t be a tool.  History will always remember Lebron James defeating a 73 win team from down 3-1 in one of the most dominating performances of all time.   Not his fault Draymond went and recruited the 2nd best player in the league to help beat “Steph’s bitch”.  Fuck outta here. 
"Someone else linked this in this thread, so [here you go.](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24021479/what-lebron-james-move-los-angeles-means-nike-sneaker-line) Apparently Kawhi said nothing has been finalized with New Balance anyway though, so this whole thread is moot.  &gt; Why would he sign a deal with NB for less money and incentives for moving markets if he could simply wait for free agency, sign to a large market and guaranteed get more money?  So he can get paid this year as well, rather than just having no endorsement money for this season."

Signing LeBron James is the worst thing the Lakers front office could have done because it's going to stunt the growth of all their young players while relying on an aging star. If they don't get KD or AD in the next few years they have to start fresh again once LeBron is gone. 
"[Brian Windhorst just wrote an article today which 100% answers your question.](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25384727/lebron-james-takes-control-lakers) Here's the pertinent part:  &gt; When James came to the Lakers, he relished the idea of being able to play off the ball more, to use his post-up skills and to generally expend less energy. That was the idea behind signing Rondo, and Lance Stephenson ... it would ease the need for James to do as much creating.  &gt; But as those who have been around James over the years will tell you, there is the July version of James when he's sitting on a couch with a glass of wine and talking basketball philosophy. And there's the midseason version of James who wants to win above all else and trusts himself above all others to make it happen. As is typical, the latter has been showing itself as the games pile up.  &gt; When Rondo has been active and he and Ball have split point guard duties, some of that has happened. When playing alongside Rondo, James had been averaging less time of possession in games than players such as Zach LaVine and Jamal Murray. When Rondo has been out, James' ballhandling time is up there with John Wall, Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul. Basically, where he has been for years."
"Why you have to say BS? I wasn't born in 2005 and just started watching the NBA. You can't simply look at stats and say the player with the better stats deserved it. Give it to Lebron then 10 years in a row if that's all it takes.   Voters fatigue also happened with Jordan. Lebron joined Wade and Bosh so expectations were really high.   I still think Rose deserved his MVP. Bulls were the #1 seed, they were a really well playing and balanced team and Rose was young, upcoming and very special (even Harden and Westbrook MVP year didn't look as good as Rose's (not looking at their triple double average), his was on a Curry level) and made a big impact on everyone. Of course that plays a role.   &gt;Rose got 1,182 points and 113 first-place votes from a panel of media voters, supplanting Wes Unseld as the youngest to win the award with a runaway win. Orlando's Dwight Howard (643 points) finished second, Miami's LeBron James was third, the Lakers' Kobe Bryant was fourth and Oklahoma City star Kevin Durant finished fifth."
Someone will take a chance on him regardless being he’s lebron James son 
"I think Lowe addressed this today in an article. Something about what Lebron wants in July (less ball handling duties) is not what he ends up wanting when the season gets going.  edit. it was Windhorst. &gt;When James came to the Lakers, he relished the idea of being able to play off the ball more, to use his post-up skills and to generally expend less energy. That was the idea behind signing Rondo, and Lance Stephenson ... it would ease the need for James to do as much creating.  &gt;But as those who have been around James over the years will tell you, there is the July version of James when he's sitting on a couch with a glass of wine and talking basketball philosophy.

LeBron James or Steph Curry.
I'm in a non-nba city surrounded by non-nba fans. The only active player I feel confident that one of these people could name is Lebron James.
Also luka is more of a point forward a la lebron james. I wouldn't call him a true pg despite his skill as a ball handler and playmaker

"I suggest people actually read [the whole article,](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25384727/lebron-james-takes-control-lakers) not just the section the OP clipped to give it as negative a slant as possible (and people around here complain that ESPN tries to start drama lol). Here's the very next part of that article following what the OP clipped:  &gt; In fact, Walton has done a good job of limiting James' minutes and using the depth he has in the backcourt to attempt to ease the burden so James can be a bit fresher. He's averaging a career-low 35 minutes.  &gt; Even if it took a bit for Walton to figure out exactly how James was comfortable in the rotation. There was a game in Minnesota early in the season when Walton removed James just five minutes into the game in an effort to set the rotation so James could finish each quarter. James was, to put it mildly, mystified.  &gt; Bottom line, things are trending more positively for the Lakers. James getting back into his comfort zone, whether it was in the original game plan or not, is helping."
"Knox is not that athletic. Above average? Probably. But you don't see him dunking over people. He has the same wingspan as Frank Ntilikina -- 7'. For comparison, here are some of the top combo forwards' wingspan:  Durant: 7'5""   Lebron James: 7'   Tobias Harris: 6'11""   Khris Middleton: 6'11""   Paul George: 6'11"" Paul Millsap: 7'2""   Ben Simmons: 7'   Giannis Antetokounmpo: 7'3""  So you can see he's about average in that group... Maybe a little below average. Probably a little above average compared to the average 6'9"" NBA player. If you compare him against combo forwards with nutty wingspan, you'll find a bunch of guys up in the 7'4""/7'5"" range."
"""He has a lot of talent,"" LeBron James said after the game. ""He's going to continue to get better and better. They chose right."""
"Lebron James for Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Jordan Bell and 2 1st round picks"
"Well this season alone for sure he’s played better than Kawhi and I’m a raptors fan. He’s playing better than lebron as well, they have comparable stats (27.6/6/8) for James and (27/13/5) Davis on similar efficiencies, considering the fact that Davis is also nearly getting 3 blocks a game, 2 steals and playing top tier Elite D and lebron has turned into somewhat of a liability on that end of the floor and I’d definitely say he’s playing better this year.

"The difference is Sixers fans *shouldn't* expect to get any free agents (because they never have). I mean, I see y'all are lining up to embarrass yourselves again next summer with another vain pursuit of a free agent you'll never get, and you're gonna salary dump yet *another* high lottery pick in the bargain. First Noel, then Okafor and now Fultz lol How embarrassing!   Laker fans expect to get free agents because free agents *actually want to play for the Lakers,* and always have. Shit, look how many all time greats were drafted by other teams and forced their way to the Lakers: Wilt, Kareem, Shaq, Kobe, Karl Malone, Gary Payton, LeBron James, etc... You act like Laker fans aren't justified in their belief that they're gonna get prime free agents. Laker fans expect it because it happens over and over and over. The only reason it hasn't happened *more* is because they've been capped out while contending for one championship after the next.  So laugh if you want to, you're just gonna be all the more pissed when every free agent overlooks the Sixers *again* in their rush to be a Laker next summer, just like LeBron did lol"
"You should check and see how many off-seasons the Lakers actually had any cap room with which to pursue free agents. The Lakers were always well over the cap cause they were always in title contention. Tough to be vying for championships while also being far enough under the cap to offer free agents a max salary. Free agents want to play for the Lakers, obviously, but most won't turn down hundreds of millions of dollars to sign for the minimum the way Gary Payton and Karl Malone did. Look what happened once the Lakers finally got some cap space: LeBron James joined them. And next summer when they have a max slot again and there's tons of great free agents? Bet against the pull of the Lakers at your own peril."
"Nah, the young players are pretty good.  Lebron James isn't good enough to be the best player on a championship team though anymore."

"It seems like when there is a sure thing in a draft (barring someone like Durant) they get taken 1st. Since 1979, 29 first overall picks have made at least an all star team or all NBA team, and 9 have made the hall of fame, with Tim Duncan, Lebron and Dwight as shoo ins, and guys like Blake Griffin and Anthony Davis on their way. It's too early to tell for KAT and Ben Simmons, but both look like franchise guys.   It seems like more often than not, there is a ""guy"" in the draft. Even the non hall of famers like Larry Johnson, Chris Webber, Derrick Rose, they were franchise guys. So basically, there is a better than 50% chance that you get a guy who could be the best player on a championship team.  There are years when you get Blake Griffin, Steph, James Harden and DeMar in the same draft; 4 guys who can carry a team.  But, it has tended to be: Tim Duncan and everyone else, Anthony Davis and everyone else. Not to say there aren't other all stars or hidden gems, but there seems to be a sure thing in each draft.  "

"That is all players, not top level players.  Dwight Howard was all NBA at age 22.  Look at say Adrian Peterson, or Lebron James.    Lebron's best years were probably 21, 23, 24, 25, 28.  He just didn't improve much after 23.    Howard did improve slightly from 22 to 23, but then once again was pretty flat for two years after that, and then fell off a cliff.  Anyway, I will try to dig through some papers and data if I find time, but if you are already an all-star at age 22, there is just as much chance of decline as improvement.  The aging curve looks like it does from all the guys who have big improvements to make in conditioning/mechanics."

"**anti-hot-take: regression to the mean is imminent.**  - The Rockets, Celtics, Wizards, and Jazz will win more games.  - The Kings, Clippers, Hornets, and Magic will win less games. - Deandre Jordan will miss a lot more free throws and Derrick Rose will miss a lot more 3s. - John Wall will have a perfectly normal John Wall season. - Kyle Lowry will have an MVP-caliber first half and then a good second half, as he does in most years. In the spring everyone will say ""where did Kyle Lowry go?"" even though he's playing pretty well. - In the playoffs, the team that Lebron James is on will mercilessly break several teams that were superior in the regular season. - The Bucks will make a super-interesting midseason trade. - Lebron will be the most valuable player in the NBA again this year, as he is every year. He will not win the MVP award. - The Raptors will not win the NBA championship. When they lose, likely in the finals or the conference finals, everyone will be like ""see, I told you they were never a contender."" The Raptors will not be the favorites to win the East next year."

"All good. But prior to those games Ty Lue had been relying on James and Love to set the screen for Kyrie so they could draw the switch (often onto Steph) then get the ball back in their hands off the switch to try to overpower the defender with their size advantage. Lebron was the primary ball handler and Kyrie often drifted off ball to create space.  Then, when K.Love went down with the concussion, Lue had the Cavs centers (Thompson) screen for Kyrie. If the secondary defender stayed in the paint, Kyrie shot. If they tried to meet Kyrie beyond the arc, he blew by them. When the Warriors tried to adjust, Kyrie was able to kick to perimeter shooters (JR) and that’s how JR was getting open looks. Jefferson was happy to space.  So Ty Lue adjusted from switches in the post to high pick n’ roll / drive-kick. Would that adjustment work against the Warriors for most teams? Probably not. Would Ty Lue make the adjustment if Love hadn’t been injured? Maybe not. But he did, and you have to give the coach credit for getting Kyrie, and to a lesser extent, Lebron, going."

"Right, but here's the thing: Lonzo was a really good college point guard, but it was LaVar, Magic, and the LA Media that made him into a franchise-changing, transcendent prospect who would draw LeBron James and Paul George to LA and, in Magic's own words, ""Bring the Lakers back to the promised land.""   *That* may have been overstating Lonzo's impact somewhat."
This is less on the fans and more on Magic for buying into LaVar's hype. When they got rid of D'Lo it seemed as though the Lakers were all but certain that Lonzo would be a major piece in convincing LeBron to join the Lakers. Now it seems like LaVar may *hurt* their chances of getting LeBron James in free agency.

"That's partially incorrect, have you ever seen LeBron James get fouled? Pretty flagrant most of the time but it isn't called because there is no intention to hurt him. He's just a big guy whose hard to stop so the fouls generally look worse than they are.   Edit: people need to read the rule, a flagrant can be called if a foul is intentional, it's up for a refs interpretation. "

"I would say Lebron James is the better/more efficient scorer. I definitely believe that Lebron could score a lot more points if he wanted to, easily snatching the scoring title. When he isn't looking at career preservation with all the stepback 2's and jackass 3's, he damn near scores at will. Especially since we are losing the physical bigs to smaller lineups and stretch bigs.   Top 5 for me is: Lebron, KD, Curry, Harden, Giannis."
"&gt; ""You can see they're not playing for Luke no more,"" Ball said from a spa resort in Birstonas, where he is staying while his two youngest sons, LiAngelo and LaMelo, get ready to make their professional debuts with Lithuanian team Prienu Vytautas. ""Luke doesn't have control of the team no more. They don't want to play for him.""  &gt; “That's a good team,"" he added of the Lakers, who have lost nine straight games. ""Nobody wants to play for him. I can see it. No high-fives when they come out of the game. People don't know why they're in the game. He's too young. He's too young. ... He ain't connecting with them anymore. You can look at every player, he's not connecting with not one player.""  &gt; LaVar Ball has had issues with his sons' coaches the past few years and even pulled LaMelo from Chino Hills High prior to the start of the season because of problems with first-year coach Dennis Latimore.  &gt; “Lonzo looked good, but he also looked disgusted,"" Ball said. ""He was ready to play. Four minutes left in the first quarter, he dunked it, getting in a flow and Coach sits him down. Sat him down. Now game goes from four points to 10 to 15 to 20. I don't know what they're doing. If he's ready to play, let him play. Don't try and monitor no minutes, put on restrictions.""  &gt; Lonzo Ball, who missed six games with the injury, finished with 11 points and five assists in 27 minutes in the Lakers' 108-94 loss to Charlotte.  &gt; Lavar Ball also said he is confident that LeBron James, whom he has never met, will be coming to the Lakers this offseason as a free agent.  &gt; “LeBron's coming to L.A. I know he's coming to L.A.,"" Ball said. ""LeBron is not a fool. What's the only way he can beat Jordan? You can't get more championships. Only one way, to say every team I've gone to I've won a championship. Go to Lakers and win a championship, then you're better than Jordan.  &gt; “You can't give my son the best player in the league, and don't expect them not to win. Get rid of everybody. Give him LeBron and Gelo [LiAngelo Ball]. You got a 2 and a 3. And it's a win. It's a wrap. Then all you need are two rebounders -- [Julius] Randle and [Larry] Nance Jr.""  &gt; But even with James, Ball doesn't feel that Walton is the right man to lead the Lakers to a title.  &gt; “Even if you bring in a LeBron or a [Paul] George, he can't coach them guys,"" he said. ""What is he gonna tell them? He's too young. He has no control."""
"Harden is legit terrible. Lebron may take plays off and Westy may hunt for boards, but no star is as bad as James Harden. It’s the reason he can score 50+ in back to back games and still lose."
"&gt; during which of course -- ... -- he was not deserving of any All-Defensive awards or the defensive reputation he had.  I agree.  &gt; But during the earlier years, he was, as much as much a defender as Paul George is today.  I agree. Very early years. Not 06-07  &gt; Defensive stats are absolutely the most flawed statistics out there.  In basketball, they arguably are.   &gt; They are especially unreliable for guards.   I'd argue that guards simply have a lesser impact on that end (in general) due to the nature of the game.  &gt; They are confounded by minutes staggering and level of play against opponents.  As most impact metrics are.  &gt; The same defensive stats have Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Paul George as pedestrian defenders.   Depends on your definition of pedestrian and which stats you're referring to.   &gt; David West leads the entire NBA in DRPM next to Aron Baynes at first. Dwight Powell rounds out the top 10, and Sala Mejri is there at 13. It's highly correlated with impact in MPG and level of competition.  Draymond Green and Rudy Gobert also led the league in that stat last season. ""Outliers"" do not necessarily make the stat unreliable. I think good stats reveal high impact players that are underrated. Whether ESPN's DRPM is a reliable stat is another topic altogether.   &gt; You're looking at DRTG, On/Off, RPM, and basing your conclusions entirely off of that.  I admit that the stat I mentioned in my original comment isn't exactly the best defensive stat available, but I didn't form my opinion based on that, it's simply a more accessible stat. The thing is that Kobe is BY FAR, the player with the most defensive accolades that no defensive metric favours. Look at his All-Defensive team selections and one might think he's an all-time great perimeter defender matched by only the likes of Scottie Pippen but no stat, on-off based or box-score based, suggests that he is.

"Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James (I use to hate him), Russell Westbrook, Isaiah Thomas and Kyrie Irving"
"I'm sorry, but Lebron James is the GOAT flopper to me. When he flopped on his own teammate to result in a technical foul for the opposing team, I just knew he was the GOAT flopper. No one had ever thought about flopping on their own teammate before, until Lebron came along. He revolutionized the art of flopping."
"&gt;So you if you do something for your team, you contribute to it's performance, and therefore success. So the performance of a team is important to this discussion, by your admission. I'm just clarifying.  I think contribution to the team is important but comparing and contrasting two players contributions to the same team isn't. Curry is a PG, a position that will almost always impact team performance more than a SF (unless you're LeBron James). With KD out the offensive structure is essentially the same. Iggy isn't gonna put up anywhere near KD numbers obviously, but the system is similar. With Curry out, that's a primary ball handler. The replacement will inevitably not be able to do some things that a Steph Curry gives you. Now instead of having everything facilitated by an all-time great PG, some back up like Livingston, who isn't getting any respect from 3, or McCaw, who is getting less respect from 3 than Curry (to say the least), will have to fill in and the entire structure of the offense has to change. This leads to more ISO ball (by Warriors standards at least).  &gt;Meh. Frankly Curry has clearly been better on offense than KD. There is no debate, and so it's not really close. I'm not saying he hasn't contributed nearly as much as him, but there is a clear separation.  In terms TS% Curry has a noticeable edge, yes, but they are still even enough where I wouldn't say Curry has anything more than a slight edge on the offensive end.   And I think I take exception to your claim that offense is absolutely more important than defense but if you explain your reasoning then I might understand better. Further, even if we assume that's true, this isn't a straight up battle between defense and offense. Curry is at best an average defender while on the offensive end he's probably the best shooter to ever play the game of basketball. Durant is easily a top 5 defender in the league right now (looking at OPP FG%, blocked shots, DRTG, etc.) and also among the most prolific scorers in NBA history. To clarify, are you saying that Curry's offense is better than KD's to the degree that KD's defensive contributions are essentially irrelevant?  Lastly, if the Warriors play better with Curry than Durant that would only prove that Curry is more valuable to the Warriors than Durant, not that Curry would be more valuable to every team than Durant. Claiming that the Warriors playing better with only Curry than with only Durant and using that as evidence that Curry would have a greater impact on a given team than Durant is essentially using a sample size of 1 to generalize. Sure, we'll never have the data to find anything statistically significant in this case, but it's just a reminder that Curry and KD on other teams might produce different results."
"Liangelo  Okay, I know the title sounds outrageous - but I'm not saying Liangelo Ball is going to have as good of a career as the greatest basketball player ever. This is more a comparison in their play-styles to highlight the shocking and drastic change in the game. Watching Liangelo Ball play, his game is just...different. He's pulling up from 30 FT and nobody bats an eye. It's become the expected thing to do. The flashy dunks is non-existent. It's been completely replaced by the three ball and it made me think if this is what people felt like watching LeBron for the first time with his dunks and ""no called traveling violations"" (quotation marks because NBA is soft now). Just interesting. I believe Liangelo Ball is a phenomenon who's going to be the first of an entire generation of basketball players that will be the result of a three-point revolution heralded in by the likes of Curry and the Warriors in the last few years. And it made me realize something. LeBron James is officially old. His game is old. His style is out. No more high IQ passing, post-ups and flashy dunks. The LeBum James ERA is offcially over folks. Liangelo Ball is the next one."

"&gt; Spacing definitely helps in isolation but having a better supporting cast which Durant has always had over Harden or Lebron eases his burden in all scoring settings. Isolation plays are very arbitrary, since Durant's teammates are always more of a threat, he has an easier time scoring in all situations, iso or not.  Watch those OKC games when KD was on the team then. There was absolutely no spacing, and Westbrook doesn't set picks for anyone else. Most of his buckets were self-created.  &gt; IMO Durant defs is not the best iso scorer in the league or he would've hit on one of the over 20 chances he had at closing out the warriors in the span of three games  lol if Harden was the best iso scorer in the league, he wouldn't have brutally choked against the Warriors in 2015 or against the Spurs last year. And Durant balled out the last game against the Warriors.  &gt;  He is not a guy you can rely on to get buckets consistently on isolation Ala Harden, Melo, or Kyrie. he is most effective coming off of picks and pin downs.  I literally just showed you that Durant in fact can be relied upon to get ISO buckets, even moreso than Harden.   &gt; Same can be said about Lebron and Harden's supporting cast. Regardless of what your opinion of those players are, they are definitely better than Harden's pre 2017/18 supporting cast and Lebron's first stint Cleveland supporting cast.  Are you kidding? You would rather have Reggie Jackson who had a 52.7 TS% that year and Serge Ibaka than Clint Capela, Aaron Gordon, and Patrick Beverly? You have to be trolling.  &gt; They were definitely miles ahead of Lebron's supporting cast of mo Williams, boobie Gibson and illgauskus.  That Cavs team had the 4th best defense in the league. That's something. Better than Reggie Jackson and Serge Ibaka.  &gt; At that time (i.e. when Lebron was age 21), the East was a stronger conference than the west with powerhouses in Detroit, Orlando, Boston, Miami, etc.  The Celtics were the 2nd best team in the Eastern Conference when LeBron was on the Heat. All of their big 3 were in their mid 30's. That Celtcis was not better than the Kobe Lakers, the Duncan/Kawhi Spurs, OKC, and the Warriors for that matter.   &gt; And also as an aside, Lebron has always been a much better playoff scorer than Durant who always seems to choke when stage is at its biggest  LeBron James in the playoffs: 28.4 PPG, 57.4 TS%  Kevin Durant in the playoffs: 28.8 PPG, 58.8% TS"

"Yep, just like Lebron James flipping a water bottle during a basketball game."
"I mean, their best defensive lineup has been Wade/Korver/Green/James/Frye with a 85.9 DRtg (and a blistering 117.8 ORtg).  But that lineup has only played 67 minutes together, and lineup data needs a big sample size to be very meaningful (and right now, our only lineup with major minutes together is Calderon/JR/Crowder/LeBron/Love with over 300 minutes together while no other lineup is over 80)."
Not unless I'm getting Stephen Curry and Lebron James confused 
Yeah if LeBron James ceased to exist.
"I think he believes he's top 50 all time, when in reality he's around like  75-100.  If he doesn't win the ring with the help of KG and Ray Allen, he's just the 2000's version of Melo or like a better scoring but worse defending Paul George. He is a Celtics legend, but is he probably isn't even top 10 at his position.      Lebron, Bird, Dr. J, Durant, Baylor, Pippen, Havlicek, James Worthy, and Dominique are the top 9 in some order. Then you have Rick Barry, Arizin, Alex English, Chris Mullin, and Paul Pierce all fighting for the 10th spot."

I think it will be   Curry / Harden / Lebron /Durant / Cousins  - If Curry stays healthy the rest of the season I think he'll be a lock. He's more popular and better than Westbrook plus I feel like bad play (Westbrook at the beginning of the season) sticks out more than an injury.  - Harden is the front runner for MVP (at least he is in my opinion)  - Lebron (is Lebron James)  - Kevin Durant &gt; Giannis  - I'm hesitant at putting Embiid over Cousins because idk how many games he'll sit out over the course of the season

You never know""  What he said:  &gt;If my teammates are available, then i'm going with my teammate ahhh, but if not I gotta go with LeBron James, best player in the world, ahh, so we can have a good relationship for the free agency, you never know...""  yours fixed:  &gt;&gt;""If any of my teammates are available, then i'll go with ~~them~~ **my teammate**, **but** If not, ~~then i'll pick~~ **I gotta go with** LeBron James, the best player in the world, so we could have a good relationship ~~and that might effect in the upcoming~~ **for the** free agency.

He has a higher PER than Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Marcelo Huertas, Hakeem Olajuwon, you name it.   That was beautiful with the Eminem line, and I really dig the cheeky Huertas name drop.

Coach: Brad Stevens  Defensive: Paul George  Rookie: Ben Simmons  MVP: LeBron James  MIP: Victor Oladipo  6Man: Lou Williams
Lebron James.   i thought he didn't have the skill to be an all time great when he was drafted.
"If I was to do awards now: COTY: Brad Stevens. His defensive schemes, great inbound plays and stellar system have lead to his team having the 2nd best record in the league in spite of them losing their best or 2nd best player to injury at the start of the season.  Runners up in order: Erik Spoelstra, Gregg Popovich  DPOY: Paul George. He mans the helm of the #1 defense in the NBA. Paul leads the league in deflections, and on top of that is averaging a good number of steals and blocks while maintaining good positional defense.  Runners Up: Steven Adams, Kevin Durant  Rookie of the Year: Ben Simmons. In spite of the 6ers slide in record, Ben Simmons has been the most productive rookie in the NBA. While other rookies (who will be runners up) have also had great scoring months, his level of consistency, play and versatility has been staggering. He's essentially making up for the 2016 draft being a letdown on his own and reminding us why teams tanked for him.  Runners Up: Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum  MVP: James Harden. Yes he's been injured. Yes Houston's record has slid without him. But its apparent when he's on the court that James Harden is at the helm of one of the best offenses, not just this year, but in NBA history. He is freakishly efficient, dominating all aspects of the offensive end of the basketball, and is showing notably improved defense. If he misses a lot more games then the race becomes closer, but for now he is the clear frontrunner in my mind.  Runners up: Lebron James, Steph Curry (in my biased opinion would be in the lead if he hadn't missed so many games but he missed too many at this point), Kevin Durant  Notable Leave Off: Giannis Antetokounmpo. Watching Giannis feels like his consistency game to game is too poor to give the award. In addition, his dropoff in production against good defenses is staggering. He feels like a case of good numbers due to usage and having the green light. I don't resent him for that, he's a great player and deserves to be recognized as such, however I think his eyepopping numbers are a bit of fool's gold. I personally like rewarding winning, and the Bucks haven't been that stellar thusfar this season. He's a great player, but he isn't in the conversation with the people above in my eyes for that reason.  MIP: Victor Oladipo. His leap in production has been amazing and its leading to wins. He's putting up career highs in all the major statistical categories and efficiency with his usage going up. Its incredible to watch.  Runners Up: I can't think of any  6th Man: I don't think there's a notable frontrunner in this category. I'm personally inclined to say Eric Gordon but I think he and Lou Will will both be off the list of possible 6moy because of how many games they start. If not them I think one of the Raptor's bench players should be rewarded because of how much they've improved, however I don't know who to choose. Poeltl maybe?"
[String bean seems a bit excessive](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/lebron-james-of-the-cleveland-cavaliers-poses-for-a-rookie-of-the-picture-id3457562?s=612x612). LeBron didn't exactly come in like a Durant; one of his selling points pre-draft was that he already had an NBA body in terms of build.
"Spo is overrated AF.  He has achieved nothing without LeBron James and DWade on his roster.  Scraping 8th seed or 9th spot in the East is not impressive. For example, Brad Stevens regularly gets top 4 with relatively poor rosters."
"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father. I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know. I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people. and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s. I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better. he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?"" and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league? I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now..... until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible.. edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass. edit2: i just thought of something else, i've been pinning this on ""the government"" when there are plenty of private companies and organizations with the funding and technology to do something like this. i mean people this is 2015.....wouldn't you be more shocked if by this point someone HADN'T tried to create a super human by now? but you never thought that you might have been watching one this whole time."
"I think LeBron rivals MJ's athleticism, not to mention other guys like James White, regardless if he wasn't an amazing player. Dude could effortlessly between legs dunk from the free throw line."
"You would be 100% right if KD didn't ball in the Finals. He was the best player on the court in that series, as evidenced by his FMVP. He hit a cold blooded dagger to seal game 3, the dude averaged the most points in the finals while also distributing and rebounding at an elite level.  Let's also not forget that Kevin Durant was out-teamed by LeBron James in his first NBA finals where KD ALSO dropped more PPG than LeBron [Source] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2012-nba-finals-heat-vs-thunder.html). Over the span of 5 years these 2 players have both beaten each other in the same,NBA finals THE SAME WAY (having the superior team) but recency has painted one to be a snake and one to be the NBA's golden child. You want a golden child? He's 40 years old and plays for the Mavs. Dirk is the only one to beat LeBron without multiple star players around him and a stud coach backing the team up."
"&gt;To say that p n r and get out of my way are Different in the context they were previously being used in this post is ridiculous of you. Their are 0 players ever who isolate play after play as an offense. The point of everthing being on one player and that team bring able to compete is obviously a relative term and if you don't understand that, I dont know what to say  First, this comment is littered with horrific grammars; I can barely decipher what you are trying to say.  There are TONS of players who isolate with huge volume.. proof?  Lebron James shoots 25% of his shots in isolation setting  Kyrie Irving had 32% of his shots in isolation setting LAST year with the Cavs in the playoffs, While Lebron went 23%. So the two best players on the Eastern Champs had more points in ISO setting than pick and roll setting.     Once again. You are wrong.    &gt;The cavs best lineups scoring the ball and defending by net rating often came at a downgrade in talent to put shooters around LeBron. Yes, your team can play better the better the players are. LeBron with love and Irving is a luxury. But the truth is, the cavs still outscored teams at an elite rate with dellevadova and fry, and jefferson and others because they can stand and shoot, (and in dellys case, compete on D)  I literally have no fucking clue what you are trying to say here.   Yes, fits matter. LOL  &gt;You talked about a pick and pop four who can set screens. Love like I said is a luxury because he can do both. LeBron however has had success with the other players, who can only do one of the two. (Frye takes poorly angled screens, and gets his screening angle wrong and doesn't scare players on a hard role, green doesnt set good screens to begin with and thompson can't pick and pop and doesn't scare teams as a passer.)  LOL. Frye is an ELITE pick and popper. He is 95 percentile while 17% of his shots are coming off pick and roll.   Jeff Green is undersized, but he sets good screens and can really finish.    Tristan thompson is 89 percentile while 27% of his shots are coming off pick and roll. That's what got him that huge contract, his mobility on both ends. He's a very good pick and roller.  Once again, wrong.  &gt;Irving was a similarly luxury. But weve seen LeBron create or revive careers out of players who seem to exist in the NBA purely to shoot threes on catch and shoots. Is it great that he has Korver? Yes, but he's suceeded with Battier. Can LeBron go 1 on 5 ecru play? No. Is the spread p n r the easiest offense in the NBA to build around when a versatile, and brilliant player on both offense and defense like LeBron lets you find players based on single skills at discounts because you need far fewer things from your role players? Yes. By far.  Succeeded with battier? You are trolling  His efficiency with the Heat was relatively low comparative to his other teams. He was such a great player because HE GUARDED THE BEST PERIMETER PLAYER ON THE OTHER TEAM; it was not Lebron that revived his career.  Once again, wrong.   Lebron James being such a great playmaker does  make it ""easy"" for a team to build a pnr team; however, that does not mean He can dominate that play without talent to win. CP3, a better passer and shooter (Who's actually a better pick and roll player than Bron), didn't maximize his abilities as a pick and roll player untill he played with Denadre and Griffin.   &gt;But the reason this is notable is that so many teams run their own versions of the spread p n r at times. They either didn't plan for it because they didn't fully commit (okc last year.) They had a player who couldnt cover the teams deficiencies when it mattered on the other side of the ball (houston the past couple of years) and many other examples. LeBron with his vision, and a team that commits to a strategy of surrounding him with these players because they've seen him do it and they realize getting elite or good shooter is more important than positional choices or fit, making it easy to do, . since he's dragged bad teams to the finals with it since 2007 (they surrounded him with average shooters and he dragged them to the finals with an assist from boobie) teams know what they need out of a LeBron team to be competitive, in a way almost no other player can make a similar claim.  Once again, you are so wrong LOL  Lebron never took a bad team to the finals... that's absolutely false.   That 2007 team was fourth in defense while leading the league in rebounds. Lebron was relatively mediocre defensively that year; He carried them offensively, but defense took them to the finals. Outside that pistons game of course lol  But once again, I have no clue what you are trying to say.   Lebron James cannot win at a high level if he does not get players that fit his game; Lebron wouldn't have waited until Bosh and Wade signed with the Heat if he was so sure he could easily be the central piece on a championship team.

"No, fuck off with this BS. The NBA literally implemented new rules to weed out flopping, whereas what Ingram did is a playthrough, if he even threw an elbow. Id argue that moving his elbow was 100% fair considering it was a natural motion. So, one stop creating a false consensus on the initiation of contact, then flops are dirty as fuck, if Jo got someone injured flopping, Id raise hell too. Offensive fouls are part of the game, and I dont even think Ingram committed one. Harris throwing down a snowangel on the court to draw a foul was terrible and it causing an injury is horrible. But I bet you love Harden's head kicks too, the reason why youre getting downvotes is because youre defending a retarded practice that cheapens the NBA and just caused an injury. The NBA's #1 priority this offseason was to root it out. Everyone should be extremely angry at Harris and at the other routine floppers. Plus he didnt just head kick, he layed down in the middle of the court, basically inviting someone to trip on him. He basically pulled a Bruce Bowen on accident. He deserves to get shit on, and even deserves a suspension. This flopping shit needs to go away, and Harris should be made an example of. Heythe refs didnt call it, so by the letter of the law, Ingram did nothing wrong, and Harris broke the one rule that the NBA is trying to enforce the hardest. Also, dont equate an offensive foul with an egregious flop. People keep their elbows out every drive, and you dont see the NBA weeding it out, hell Lebron has made a career out of it, it is basically an NBA move. Flopping on the other hand, is barely a soccer move. But have fun watching James Harden flop his way to 20 free throws."
"Magic used to have these tweets where he would say something like ""This NBA season has been great. Kevin Durant he has been playing at an MVP level."" Then he would have a second tweet that would be like, ""Some other players playing like a MVP are Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden. More players like LeBron, Giannis and Kawhi have also been MVP worthy."""
“Maybe you need to use a bigger monitor”  My guy I was watching the game live on my 65 inch 4K tv just because you’re a fan of Ingram doesn’t protect you from seeing something that didn’t happen. Ingram shields the ball and devin flops that’s pretty much it. I can really tell you don’t play ball if you think that’s “driving an shoulder” into his chest. Ingram is planting his feet to hold his ground and defend the ball. Devin also snaps his head back so wildly Lebron James would have to go at him for that to happen not a 190 pound skinny player like Ingram. If you don’t see how that was a flop idk what to tell you man if it’s not homerism like you said then you’re just not good at looking at game film.

"What? There's a clear drop off. Love was a top 3 PF at the time. Unless you draft Lebron James, there's no way you expect no change, or a better change.  The point of tanking is not just to lose, it's to gain young assets while doing so. Thats what the T-Wolves were doing. If you're a tanking team, it's better to have a young player under control for four years, than an all star that everyone wants under control for one"
"if you average 70 games a season for 8 years thats 560 combined with the 617 games Love has already played by age 29 you're expecting him to play 1177 games and until age 37.  Seems pretty far out for a player that realistically is already past his peak.   EDIT: For clarity 1177 games would put Love at [45 all-time right now](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/g_career.html), thats currently more games played than Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Richard Jefferson, Zach Randolph, LeBron James."

"&gt;Lebron's averaging 27/9/8, shooting 64% TS while also playing 15 more games than him, so no Curry hasn't been better.  This is a better argument but a very poor one.   First, Lebron James is barely a positive when he's on the floor. Cav's bench? A stronger positive.   &gt;There's no way any reasonable person is taking 28 games of Steph over 42 games of Lebron.   Second, Uh. I will.   Curry was better, by a decent margin, in his 28 games than Lebron's 42. There's no way you can give Lebron credit for playing more games, when he has also been horrid defensively and incredibly poor in his offensive impact (Compare to Curry).  If it's a slight edge, I would absolutely say Bron was playing better; Difference between them is not very close right now.   &gt; Lebron should be ahead on every MVP list.  Third, idc about the MVP list. Curry has been better in the regular season.   &gt;He was pretty fucking amazing most of the last playoffs except for the Finals (on defense).  Most of his final appearances are littered with bad defense. I do agree he was much better in the playoff series tho."

Jayson Tatum Jr vs Lebron James Jr EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS 
"Offensively:   - Lebron James has not  been close to Curry's offensive numbers this season, from efficiency to volume. Curry is averaging more points while shooting **4** percent higher.  - Curry's offensive impact stats completely destroys Lebron's (Even though Lebron's numbers are inflated due to his rebounds); Warriors play better, by a huge margin, when Curry is on the floor.   - Curry has far stronger gravity; he has been creating better looks for his teammates than Lebron this season.   Defensively?  Lebron is having his worst defensive season since 2004.  Curry has been passable to mediocre defensively; Lebron have been atrocious"
"It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"Yeah, defensively is what I was wondering. LeBron has a tendency of playing softer in the regular season, something Pop would not put up with. I think that would be the biggest cause of friction if he played for Pop. Pop said that he learned with LMA that he should have let him do what he does best offensively, which we've seen him allow him to do this season, but defensively, he expects him to play his way, which, to LaMarcus' credit, he's done a really good job of. I think James has enough respect for Pop and how he runs his defense that would buy into his defensive system, but I wonder how he would handle not having much in a say when it comes to personnel decisions. We don't really pursue the FA market that often anyways. Really, the biggest signings and trades over the past 15 years was getting Richard Jefferson, LMA, and Rudy Gay in FA, and the trade of Hill that got us Bertans and Kawhi."
"When you're on the cusp of a championship you make moves for short term gratification. The Cavs took 37 years to get to the finals and it only happened because LeBron fucking James came along. When you're this close you go all in on a championship, not a #4-8 draft pick and possibly 40 more years before you have a chance like this again "
"&gt;can you jump during a free throw  Yes, you just have to land behind the lines  &gt; what is the difference between the positions  In NBA basketball positions get less and less important, but its still interesting:  Point Guard: Usually the smallest guy in a team. His duties are making the plays (often calls them as well), organizing the offense and getting his teammates good looks. Needs to have great handles, good court vision and passing, and in the best case scenario a good shooter and finisher around the rim. There are pass first point guards (Rondo, Rubio, CP3 to an extend) and score first point guards (Irving, Curry to an extend).  Shooting Guard: A bit bigger than the Point Guard he is often a primary scoring option beyond the arc. Also scores by cutting to the basket or off the dribble. Often the better defender thant he PG (as he is typically taller and has less duties on offense). A lot of SGs are considered ""3 and D"" players(Thompson, Ariza, Danny Green), so they basically shoot 3s and play tough defense on the best guard of the opposing team. Point and Shooting Guard together form the backcourt.  Small forward: Similar to the shooting guard. Typically he'd shoot less 3s and score more in the paint, often can post up as well. But the line between SGs and SFs is very blurred, often both positions are simply referred to as ""wings"".   Power Forward: One of the two ""big men"". Smaller than a center, but taller and heavier than SFs. In old school basketball they scored similarily to centers, around the rim and with posting up. Today a lot of PFs are so called ""Stretch fours"" that play beyond the arc, a style of play that was extremly popularized by Dirk Nowitzki. Other stretch fours would be guys like Love, Anderson or Porzingis.   Center: The other ""big man"". Used to be the most important position in Basketball, today less so. Gets rebounds, sets screens and scores around the rim. In modern NBA basketball some centers can shoot 3s as well (Cousins, Embiid), but they still often hang around the rim to get offensive boards. Most important position on defense, as they protect the rim against driving and cutting wings as the most important help defender. SFs, PFs and Cs are the front court.  Then there are some ""special"" positions: A swingman is a player between a shooting guard and a small forward (Butler, George), a combo guard can play both guard positions (James Harden for example). A point forward is a SF who doubles as playmaker (LeBron, Giannis)"
"Chalmers, Ray Allen, Korver, J.R Smith, Mo Williams, Kyrie, James Jones, Mike Miller, Daniel Gibson, Channing Frye, I mean the list goes on. Hell Wade, Bosh, and Love have all had terrific seasons playing with him too. Now if your arguing LeBron needs a certain type of player with him to flourish that's ok. But its asine to suggest ""no player has ever flourished"" playing with him."
"Could be a lot of things. Less effort, the fact that every PG on the roster is a sieve on defense, the fact that most of the players even outside of the PG spot are sieves on defense including Lebron James himself. They can't defend, guys are under-performing tremendously and it's finally catching up with them. You saw a lot of this in Lebron's last year in Miami, except he was still in his prime and a great defender. You can look at the Cavs [BBRef](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2018/lineups/) lineups page and see how many negatives are attributed to the lineups they use the most.  "
In a couple of words: Lebron James
"Yeah, you try standing up for yourself to Lebron James "
"As much as id like someone else to get to the finals from the east I don't think itll be close. Let's face it, every January the cavs slump and this year they actually have an excuse. Either way the cavs will roll thru the east again. Whenever teams play lebron they always have soemthing to prove, everyone wants a shot at the king. When the Celtics come to town it isn't the same. No eastern conference team has beaten a lebron james led team in a playoff series in 7 years. "
"Not sure what the eastern playoffs have to do with teams in the west. There's a massive cluster of teams in the same tier and then there's the Raptors and Celtics who look like they have the most balanced and talented rosters alongside the Cavs who have Lebron James to take them as far as they can go.  Now it's early, things can always change but right now, too many of these teams in the lower seeds have deficiencies that would make it very tough to pull an upset."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

I go to sleep at night looking up at the stars, wondering what celestial being aligned the universe in such a way to make an event as amazing as this occur.

That's a big part of what made me love him so much back in Chicago (not that I don't love him now). I think part of it is that he was the 30th pick and Thibs was known to not give young guys many minutes and Jimmy was able to prove his worth and get more and more minutes by playing defense. Even before he was a star on both sides of the floor we would put him in for the sole purpose of guarding Lebron because he could do it better than anyone on our team. That seems obvious now but it seemed crazy at the time that this guy who barely got any playing time was being put in because he was good enough to guard Lebron fucking James. He earned his place in the NBA by being a hustle guy and I'm glad he's never changed.

There's alot of great players who don't really play good defense but get a pass and no one really mentions it to the level of LeBron and Harden. Wall, DeRozan etc don't play as good defense as they do offense and just like the 'James brothers', take plays off, but no one mentions it. As for Hardens assists, he drives and dishes, attracts double coverage and dishes, has flashy passes, brings players into the game, utilises Capela extremely well with alley oops assists. This is a guy who's primary position is SG. Imo if anything his playmaking is underrated. "

Toronto is a great city to put up numbers and build a rep."
"I mean this is obviously the case. The most natural Lebron James team would be something like what Houston has (ie star ball handler + great pick and roll big + a bunch of lengthy shooters). But Lebron is a good enough player that there should be other formulas that you can build around him that work. This iteration of the Cavs isn't the most natural for the Lebron spread PnR and kick game, but if I were Lue I'd start looking other places for offense. Lebron and Love are both so good in the post, why not make that more of the centerpiece of your gameplan? With those two controlling the high post or elbows, with guys like Green, IT and Wade acting as cutters around that. There do this sometimes, but not as much as they could. Often it feels like they get Love a couple post touches early kind of as a ""Okay big man we want to feed you"" sort of thing but go away from it later.  There is no reason they can't run so many of the actions the Warriors run where we drop it in to Green or Zaza or West in the post and then have Curry and Klay run splits, or people backdoor cut. Yeah those actions are more effective with the gravity of Curry and Klay, but while the Cavs lack that, they make up for it in the fact that Lebron James is waaaaaaay more terrifying in the post and demands way more attention than Draymond.   Honestly the fact that Lebron is so good kind of acts as a crutch for this team. Even playing with un-ideal supporting parts in a badly coached system he can make them one of the best offensive teams year in and year out. So I'm sure Lue and the players to an extent are thinking ""Well its not broke, why fix it?""  But the bigger issue for Cleveland is defense. Last year they were bad on D and all year people kept assuming they could turn it up for the playoffs. And they could to a degree, but they got shredded by the warriors. The same concern needs to be at the front of their minds this year. They just have 0 rim protection. They desperately need a big man who can hold that down, but who also can hopefully play with Love. But bigs who can protect the rim, and aren't a total liability versus teams like the Warriors or Rockets are tough to find. And then their perimeter defense isn't great either. Lebron can turn it up in the playoffs, but even then he isn't the stopper he once was, and particularly struggled last year against KD. Which, no shame, everyone struggles against KD more or less. But still, you can't be counting on playoff Lebron to suddenly take an awful defense to a good one. "
"&gt; The Mavs pour in 1.18 points per possession when Nowitzki sets a pick for a ball-handler, seventh among all high-volume screen-setters, behind only Zaza Pachulia, LeBron James, Luke Babbitt, Channing Frye, Jordan Bell and Draymond Green, per Second Spectrum. (To review: three Warriors, the game's best player, a shooting big man who plays with the game's best player, and Luke Babbitt for some reason.)  Not sure why he put in that line about Babbitt. Babbitt has always been an excellent shooter, especially for a forward. It's not too surprising that he's up there."

"Oh please. The ONLY reason lebron needs to do this if he does is because his teamates are complete shit. lebron slows the ball movement and only passes to you when he believes you have an ""assist""/shooting position? and you cant hit it? At what point did any of these players give lebron james any indication that they were good enough to execute proper ball movement or strategy. When lebron had competent teamates he moved the ball alot faster ( Miami Heat ).  "
"I have said this for years now and get downvoted every time. Kyrie had a higher usage percentage because James milked the shot clock for so long in like 80% of possessions so obviously if he passes to Kyrie he's going to have to shoot it (and because he was their best offensive player).  Every team LeBron has played on (disregarding his original stint with the Cavs as I don't remember any of those games besides the 2007 Finals) has played sooooooooo slow in the half court. It's maddening. Obviously that isn't going to work nowadays especially when you have shooters that need ball movement and off ball action to get open for a shot.  This is LeBron's biggest weakness by far and why I don't think he's ""top 3 all time"" like others have so prematurely declared. But he gets away with it because people think he can do no wrong and because he's ingrained a ""You may not criticize me"" culture in all his teams."

"Here's the serious case:  Kobes squad that he took to win the title was incredibly weak...and he went 3 years in a row despite the Spurs being dominant.  No one else was an all star besides Gasol.  I think Pau Gasol is overrated, I think Kevin Love and Chris Bosh were better....at having Kevin Love or Chris Bosh would be enough to get Kobe to win a title.   However, Lebron needed someone even better than gasol, Love or Bosh as his 2nd best player...he needed wade or Kyrie.    If Kobe had Gasol and Wade, or Gasol and Kyrie, he'd easily win in the West 3 titles in 3 years, instead he won 2 in 3 years with Gasol as his 2nd best player and a non-all star as his 3rd best.   Thats just one argument.   Another argument is Kobe did better without that than Shad did without him.  Kobe won 2 titles, and made it to the finals 3 times.  Shaq won 1 title and made it to the finals twice.  Shaq needed someone as good as Kobe to win a championship.  Shaq, in my opinion, based on  hardware and championships and defense, is not above Kobe all time.   Kobe, based on hardware, championships, and defense is above shaq.    Another argument is the 2008 season.  Kobe wasn't in his prime, won an MVP, almost a title, won the olympics and notorious hater bill simmons said he never seen the 'best player in the world' arguemnt end so quickly and decisively as the gold medal game. Kobe wasn't in his prime, but wade, bosh, james, paul and melo all were.  Kobe rose above all of them and they looked to him to win.    How is a person in the 15th year in the league the best player in the world still, over guys in their primes?  Kobe top 5 easily...and he didn't chase Shaq out...shaq chasing movies and albums and cheesburgers chased shaq out.   Replace Shaq w. Duncan in LA and they win more than Shaq."
"This is the entire philosophy of the Cavs offense is play through James/another playmaker. Until this year, they had LeBron and Kyrie to run the offense through.

"Except it had been working. We made the playoffs 7 straight years, most of the time with 50 wins or more. We made a Conference Finals.

Everyone points to our success in the playoffs against the Spurs as a testament to Fizz's coaching, but we got blown out in the first two games and it only got more competitive and went to six when he started Zach Randolph, going back on something he had been trying to do the whole season.  His only success was a result of going back on his system that he was trying to implement the whole season, and letting the Grizzlies play the way we had always played.   Then in the offseason, he had management get rid of Zach Randolph and Tony Allen, and had known 3 point brick machines Andrew Harrison and Mario Chalmers fire away. We lost 8 straight. He didn't lose his job because he benched Marc in the 4th against Brooklyn at home, his job was ticking a year ago when he told a proud veteran locker room they hadn't accomplished anything, and claimed that he had, when in reality he was just lucky enough to coach LeBron James."

(besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.

I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass."
What the fuck does that mean Lebron James
LeBron James 
"Players with elite BBIQ and vocal leaders on the court like Draymond Green, LeBron James, CP3, Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Al Horford"
somehow the answer is still lebron james and we should all be disappointed in ourselves. 
"This. If he puts in the effort like say a LeBron James does (who is still actively trying to make his shot and overall game better) he can definitely change it. Like you said though, depends how much he wants it. "
"""What the fuck does that mean, LeBron James?""  ""You're welcome."""
"&gt;and stagger in between.   If you can't maximize LeBron and Simmons and Embiid on the floor together, how do you expect to beat the Warriors? LeBron is the only one of those 3 that is a serious threat at range (I was happy when Embiid was pulling up for three pointers in game 2) and even then forcing LeBron into a jumpshot is a huge W for the defense (unless you're the Raptors).   &gt;Their defense will be absurdly good.  I agree with this.  &gt;Lebron will feast having someone who can actually find his cuts, which will allow him to play off ball more. Simmons vice versa.  So LeBron is going to be the Robin to Simmons' batman? Idk how you sell LeBron on that one. Also, if you take the ball out of LeBron's hands you're handing a W to the defense because the ball is in the hands of Ben Simmons instead of LeBron James."
"Notes:   LeBron James- in a few of the 5 or fewer games, then isn't in 10,15,20,30, or 40, but reappears on 50 and stays on all the rest of the lists thereafter. (Shaq and Karl Malone too).  No Wilt was interesting."
You realise those are James Harden/Lebron level numbers right? You are in the MVP race with 30/10
"Nobody is disputing his physicality or his greatness (top 5 all-time 100%)..I am disputing 27.2 ppg in a pussified NBA being the GOAT. There is no denying the game today is a more finesse outside kind of a game as opposed to the rough handcheck physicality inside/mid range game of the 80's/90's. LeBron would still be a super star in that era but 27.2 probably means 26.9 and a couple less rebounds a game. As I said there are plenty Charles Barkley size 6'6""-6'8"" 225-250ish bruts that are not getting pushed around by LeBron. His pull-up mid range jumper is suspect at best, he should be greatful he is playing in this era. I love King James, he just is not the GOAT."
But the mean is pretty fuckin good because LeBron “outlier” James
"Lmfao Tyreke Evans averaged 20-5-5 in his rookie year,  becoming the fourth player to do so.    The first thee?   Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James "
Umm duh Lebron James.
Lebron James 
"The ""Grit n Grind"" Grizzlies had become a brand in Memphis, and Fizdale's objective was to blow it up.  ""He wanted his own locker room,"" a Grizzlies source told the Daily News. ""And he basically convinced management to get rid of Zach (Randolph), to get rid of Tony Allen.""  Trying to morph the Grizzlies was always going to strain a relationship with Gasol, and the toxicity reached a pivotal moment when, according to a source, Fizdale confronted the team about its lack of desire following a defeat. The coach went around the locker room asking each player if he believed he could win a championship. If they lacked belief, they didn't belong on the Grizzlies.   **The younger players went along. Gasol, however, answered, ""No."" Then when asked for an explanation, Gasol replied, ""We don't have the right leader.""**  Fizdale had a solid comeback, but it couldn't have helped his future with Gasol.  **""I get it, you want Gregg Popovich, and I want LeBron James,"" the coach told his star player, according to a source.**  The frosty relationship carried on for almost a year before Fizdale was fired in the middle of an eight-game losing streak. By that time, according to sources, Fizdale had alienated Gasol by disregarding the Spaniard's accomplishments — both in the NBA and overseas — and casting away Randolph and Allen. In pushing away Randolph, Fizdale even told the media that the two-time All-Star was no longer an NBA starter and moved him to the bench to audition for his next job. Privately, that didn't play well. The firing came a day after Fizdale benched Gasol for the entire fourth quarter of a defeat in Brooklyn. "
"If this was Lebron fighting with the whole Cavs bench, no one would care. This is going to go viral then everyone will pile on James Harden. Rockets had a big lead and these guy were still arguing about something that wasn't right on a rotation or something. I like it."
"Due to the Cavs troubles with big men, it would seem that the Pelicans would actually have a really decent chance if it weren't for this guy named Lebron James."
"What do you mean hyped up? As in like they don't really deserve it?   Simmons averaged 16/8/8 in his first year on the court and Mitchell averaged 20.5 and has already become the team's closer in tough games. They're both fantastic rookies by recent standards. The last 3 ROTY winners to average more points than Mitchell in their rookie year were Blake Griffin (22.5), Lebron James (20.9) and Tim Duncan (21.1). The last ROTY to average more assists than Simmons was Damon Stoudemire in 95-96. "
King James and then Jordan... you get more years of Lebron plus the whole Jordan baseball thing 
LeBron James
"He’s at least as good as Hakeem, and so what if his greatest asset was genetics? He still had great IQ and post moves. With this logic Kobe Bryant is a better basketball player than LeBron James because LeBron’s greatest asset is genetics?"
"I totally agree that Lebron can play with any team. But the fact is Rockets is Hardens team. And honestly I think he can easily win 2 rings if he keeps playing like this for next 5 years or so.   Also there is a big difference between CP3 and unarguably the second greatest player ever in LBJ.   When the time runs out, who do you think will take the shot? I'm not saying that there will be jealousy or anything, but what I'm saying is that Harden is on track to one of the best of all time.   Unless of course, Warriors again destroys the league then I'm all for it and let Lebron James Harden destroy the snake and gorilla.   "
"I don't realistically think he will come here, I was just joking around with the play on names ""Lebron James Harden"". It would be pretty cool to have those shirts / custom jerseys made. Houston wont be able to afford him unless Morey fleeces a team into taking Ryno which is pretty much impossible. We also have to resign Capela who is going to get PAID and cp3 next season so the chances are basically slim to none.  Not sure why people think Harden or Lebron are selfish like that though. People said the same exact shit about Chris Paul and were clearly proven wrong about there only being one ball. All 3 of those players are very unselfish and will make players around them better. Harden is at 8.8 APG while sharing the ball with CP3 at 7.9 APG, a team with 3shooters and a PnR center thrives with these types of unselfish players.   Lebron loves to coast in the Regular season and Harden definitely wants less stress and more help in the post season which is where Lebron comes out in true form. The team actually works out in theory to me."
"&gt;You have a warped understanding of what it entails competing at highest level in sports,  By joining your competition instead of getting better to beat them? Very typical of the snowflake generation to hate working hard and instead wanting to take the easy way out, but still expect people to give them full due.  What Kevin Durant and Lebron James did was put in cheat codes in a game they couldn't beat instead of getting better. But let me guess, cheat codes aren't really about making it easier to win right?  &gt;There are no extra medals for getting things done the hard way, just the opposite, actually.   No but now Kevin Durant's career is a joke. He'll have the rings but not the glory."

"It was only an upset because the Warriors were up 3-1. The Cavs had the so called best player in the league in Lebron James, plus two other all-stars in 2016.   They definitely had the talent to compete, plus a plethora of shooters surrounding Lebron.   I would say the Warriors in 2007 beating the 67-15 Mavericks team was a bigger upset. Even though they always gave the Mavs issues in the regular season."
"Pretty interesting, he’s definitely more of a Lebron stopper type like James Johnson Draymond Green, who are strong and just athletic enough to slow him down.  But remember Morris had Drummond in his breakout season behind him. That deters Lebron from slashing last Morris because I’m very sure Lebron is faster than Morris. In Boston it’s a different situation. Baynes was the backup in Detroit . At Boston he plays alongside Horford, often as the rim protector. If Horford closes games out Vs Cleveland it will become even harder for the Celtics coz Bron isn’t remotely scared of Al, he’s won against Al every season in the playoffs for a few seasons now. Al is a great defender but Lebron will score on him,and even if he misses the layup he’s muc more of a chance to get the rebound than if it was Baynes there. And Baynes himself still isn’t the best rim protector. Lebron will dunk all over him. Love Baynes but he’s got limitations, can’t play in the perimeter and isn as athletic as American Centres.   "

How many people do you know named.... Lebron....I know a lot of Micheals, I know a lot of Irvings, I know Irving Robinson that grew up in my hometown! I know a lot of Kyries, I know A LOT A LOTTA people named Larry. How many Lebron's you know? HOW MANY SKEEEIP!!!"
Getting swept in the first round =/= being swept by LeBron fucking James. Our backcourt isn't playing nearly as bad as r/nba is acting either.
All the players that are better than Steph: 1.Michael Jordan 2.LeBron James 3.Magic Johnson 4.Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 5.Kobe Bryant 6.Shaq 7.Bill Russell 8.Wilt Chamberlain 9.Tim Duncan 10.Larry Bird 11.Hakeem The Dream 12.Oscar Robertson 13.Moses Malone 14.Julius Irving 15.Moses Malone 16.Dirk  17.Kevin Garnett  18.Kevin Durant 19.Jerry West 20.Isiah Thomas (original) 21.Dwayne Wade(you could make a argument)  These were all I could come up feel free to argue with me lol
"Who decided this finals or bust thing? I guess Kyrie being gone and the Raptors evolving gives some reason, but Lebron is still in the East. That's not really a realistic goal for them with Lebron there. I get the three year window they have, but that window being open to the finals is something which should have been hard to believe after the previous two seasons.   I don't think this year shows us much except they can't compete with James which we already knew. But next year he might be out of the East. I still wouldn't expect them to make the finals, but it would be more realistic situation to consider the pressure to be on.    Harden and Paul losing to the Warriors will get some choke comments, the Raptors will get some, and more attention. People hold them to a higher standard than the Raptors."
"So? Elite defense won’t stop Curry from hitting three’s and KD from nailing everything in his defenders face. LeBron-Kyrie was a much more effective and efficient scoring duo than Harden and CP3 are and Harden is just a miles worse player than LeBron James is. Also, Rockets defense relies heavily on Capela. Warriors can go small, the fuck is Capela going to help then? Stay out on perimeter on Draymond? Capela has got no offensive game himself to exploit anything on the other side of the floor and Draymond would be more than capable of defending him even if he had. Warriors in 6. "
Lebron James
Probably because Utah fans aren't calling Mitchell the second coming off LeBron James
It’s really not close. 2010 was the start of LeBron’s 4 year peak in Miami. And Kobe was 32. [Here’s their 2010 seasons side-by-side](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;y1=2011&amp;player_id2_hint=Kobe+Bryant&amp;player_id2_select=Kobe+Bryant&amp;y2=2011&amp;player_id2=bryanko01&amp;idx=players).
I feel like the upsetter not having LeBron James and the upsettee adding KD makes up for that difference. I respect your opinion though it's definitely arguable.
"If Lebron James said that Kobe was better than him, then Kobe was better than him at that point. "
"&gt; Only one generation left the country worse off than they found it—and continues to double down on its greedy despoilation at this very moment. (The answer is neither gen x nor the millennials.)  Blaming others and not taking any responsibility. Sounds right. Sounds like Kevin ""joins a 73-win team"" Durant and Lebron ""it's too hard so I quit on my team to form a super team"" James too. As I said, Snowflake Generation."
the lakers are not getting lebron james 
"He started strongly hence the reason why he was getting early MVP talks. It was after that bad month of January where he played poorly, not crusing, that James Harden pulled ahead.   This was not a crusin year for LeBron at all. "
He's in his prime. He's a Tim Duncan. He's a LeBron James. He's in his prime as soon as he entered the NBA.
Lebron James and Michael Jordan always are.
"&gt; I mean, if you don’t think the Warriors didn’t get dogshit calls g3/g4 I don’t know what to say. Just a fact.  Cavs got it too. The most blatant sign of rigging was in favor of the Warriors. It was laughable they gave Draymond's 2nd technical foul to Steve Kerr when they realized they would have to boot him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8aD6OZzIdY  Lebron James and Kevin Love were called for 4 fouls each in Game 1. Kyrie Irving was called for 5 fouls in Game 3 and 4 fouls in Game 4. Love was even called for a flagrant foul on Durant after Durant yelled at the refs and told them too. *Hurr the refs helped the Warriors that's why they won*."
"LeBrOn James Jr., Derozan, Lowry"
"by being way better than them, do you understand the gap between someone like LeBron James and Jordan Clarkson, you don't think he could 4v5 that guy?"
"One thing is for sure, Kevin Durant can't influence the game the way Lebron James does. James is on a different level come playoffs."
"&gt;  remember we just had a 59 win season with him as well.  This is what makes the talk of rebuilding so dumb to me, and what makes me think that there's no way in hell Ujiri blows everything up any time soon. In terms of the regular season, this has literally been the best season in the entire history of the franchise. While that doesn't mean as much as deep playoff runs, it *is* a sign that what they're doing right now works. In a few years, when Lowry, DeRozan, Ibaka (inb4 secretly in his 30s jokes) and Valanciunas start declining? Potentially, but blowing everything up after a bad series against LeBron James would be a huge overreaction, considering that it's been *eight years* since a non-LeBron team won the eastern conference."
I can’t remember him giving Mitchell any credit. He always say he’s better than anyone except Lebron cause he’s proclaiming himself as the next Lebron James 😂 
"LeBron outweighs Pip by at least 50 pounds... And you named all those great centers which are just that, great. Incredible players. But you want one of them to guard LeBron James, arguably the greatest physical specimen the world has ever seen, out on the perimeter? Which one of those guys wouldn't get their ankles broken?   Yes, they could foul him. But what happens when they all foul out?   You can assume MJ would be great in this era, which is perfectly fine. He's an inch shorter than Derozan, but he himself is a great athlete and a hell of a basketball player. But you can't just assume that LeBron can't have his present-day athleticism in MJ's era. There's that article that says LeBron ran a 4.6 40, at 270 lbs. Tough to foul or get physical with something you can't catch.   If nobody else could ever be better than Jordan, why do you even bother watching basketball? Appreciate greatness, my brother. "
When can't a offensive player use their shoulders to create space? Literally every elite player does it?   That's how LeBron James gets so many of his his drive ins by using the strength of his upper body and shoulders.  NBA calls fouls more based on what the arms and hands are doing and not the body.
"I used 34% because that's his *career* average. The past two seasons he's actually shot 36+% on 4.6 and 5.0 3PA/game, respectively. He's shooting better and at a higher volume than his career averages.  Five of the past seven seasons he's been over 36%.  &gt; it's also a below average outcome for a league average player.  A league average player probably either isn't shooting 3s because they are an inside guy or they have to shoot 36% or better because otherwise they're not on the team. Kyle Korver is off the roster at that rate, because he can't drive like LeBron. Specialists like that will always skew your numbers.  There are 33 players who played in at least 40 games, scored 15 ppg, and shot 36% or better. That's it. LeBron is one. Do you know who's right beside of him when you sort by 3P%? James Harden and Damian Lillard."
"On paper...watch out.  I think personality wise...no.  Lebron is huge and somebody who dominates on and off the court.  I can't see him fitting in with the vibe the Jazz locker room has this year.  This isn't a slight on lebron.  I just think a part of the jazz's success comes from the fact that there isn't an ego on the team.  We always read stories about how such and such coach did such a great job of managing all the egos on their team etc.  With all that said, I might be wrong.  If there is one thing to take away from James is that his drive and will to win is probably the biggest there has ever been.  Thats some heady company in that category.  If anybody could set aside ego because it's ruining team chemistry and hurting their ability to win it would be Lebron IMO.  We got crowder at the deadline this year from cleveland.  He has arguably performed better for the Jazz then he did for his last team.  Maybe getting him out of the shadow of Lebron is what he needed...maybe not."
Oh when did he coach Lebron James?
"Guys what if Donovan Mitchell real rookie's his way into beating PG13, Melo, Westbrook, CP3, Harden, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Steph Curry, and LeBron James."
"&gt;We are living in an unprecedented offensive stat explosion yet you think Jordan had it easier?  Yeah because he played smaller, unathletic players. The hand-check doesn't matter if you outweigh the guy. Jordan was 216 before baseball. Jordan is second greatest athlete in terms of pure athleticism the league has ever seen. A part of that was Jordan's strength playing smaller players.  &gt;There was a post about 278 Pound Miami LeBron  The post said LeBron gained 7 pounds in a play off game and he played at 270. LeBron got up to 270 for 2 years before losing all of it and getting back down to [the size he played at the rest of his career](http://www.businessinsider.com/experts-lebron-james-diet-2014-9)  LeBron played at 250 most of his career. He was lighter when he first entered the league as well.   &gt;Moncrief was 2 -time DPOY as was Rodman. Payton won one too.  Jordan faced them and tons of all defensive guys.  Moncrief was drafted in 79. He won both his DPOY awards before Jordan entered the league. He also won his last first-team all defense Jordan's second year. When Jordan was out with a broken foot.  Guess what Moncrief's height was? 6'3. Do you see a pattern emerging of Jordan playing undersized players he was able to take advantage of due to the rules?  Moncrief never averaged more than 12.1 points a game and his defensive ratings dropped after the 85-86 season, the year Jordan was out with a broken foot. Jordan played against prime Moncrief a total of 7 times in his career. That's your go to? someone who Jordan played 7 times?  Rodman played with Jordan for half of his rings. Rodman also didn't guard Jordan either. Payton guarded Jordan for a 3 game stretch in the finals coming off a torn Achilles. Payton also played another position and was in another conference for the entirety of Jordan's career.  He rarely faced Payton. Payton guarded him one series and it was because the Sonics were already down, because (oh shit, another) 6'3 unathletic SG guard named Hersey Hawkins was getting cooked by Jordan.  &gt;You are delusional. Calling Klay and Durant and Jaysn Tatum athletic compared to LeBron but guys like, DJ, Dumars, Rodman frail compared to young Jordan.   I never said Rodman was frail. By DJ do you mean Dennis Johnson, because he was 6'4 and 180 pounds. If you meant Doctor J he was drafted 13 years before Jordan. He was 3 years away from retirement on a steady decline when Jordan entered the league. Klay, Durant, Jayson Tatum, Kawhi, Butler, PG, Derozen are all athletically superior to players you've mentioned and they also were the same height or taller than LeBron, with better help defense behind them.  You claimed Jordan played against elite athlete's but went on to named 6'4 shooting guards and point guards under 6'2 who couldn't get any help guarding him off ball and were too small to handcheck.  "
"&gt; You mean, like Lebron took the last shot of game 5 this year? Or how he put up 45 points in game 7? Which part of this is he scared of?  When he passed the ball to Drew Gooden instead of taking the final shot? Or when he has pathetic 4th quarter performances but MJ was known to elevate his game in the 4th quarter?  Or when Ray Allen bailed him out? Or when Kyrie Irving bailed him out with the 3 pointer?  I will say one thing: both Lebron James and Kevin Durant were clutch in the sense they knew they could never lead a team to the Championship so they joined super teams. Remember, Lebron went to Wade not the other way around."
Lebron James lives next to me?
Yeah i tend to agree here. Stevens is a magical coach but it’s one thing to gameplan for a rookie and another to gameplan for Lebron James. Healthy Celtics would win easily but with what he’s got right now (still a really good team) I don’t see it. Probably a few press conferences like last year “he’s a really good player. I didn’t think he could get any better but he is”
"thats just one guy amongst 8-12 players. Cleveland dominates everyone in the playoffs not just Al. With these ""Al is 1-16 against Lebron in the playoffs..."" kind of logic then you can also say ""Igoudala is 8-1 against James Harden in the playoffs..."" but we all know Iggy isnt the reason gsw is 8-1 against houston"
"What LeBron is doing right now is unreal. I still hesitate to give him GOAT status over Jordan because I've seen James quit on teams before (2010 Playoffs with Cleveland before ""The Decision"", 2014 Finals vs. Spurs) and of all the things you can say about Jordan, he NEVER quit on the floor, ever. His killer drive to win just would not allow it. That all being said, what LeBron is doing right now, especially at his age with as much mileage as he has on his body, it just unbelievable."
Why not add the most obvious players he compared to. Like lebron james who was a horrid shooter and sometimes still is but is much improved or magic. This seems cherry-picked.  Lebron Rookie year: .438 2p%	.290 3p%  then his best year  .602	2p% .406	3p%  Or draymond who started off as .209% 3P% .327	2P%  I think people point is that if he could shoot 40% from 2 he'd be good tho.

"No, you say that the points aren't the only thing you are referring to but then you never refer to anything else.  You seem to not understand that you can't just say something and that makes its true. You can't just say that scoring isn't the only thing you are referring to if you never refer to anything but points.  It is not semantics.   Lebron James put up those stats in 2012-13 when he won the title and finals MVP and was praised for his amazing playoff performances. Giannis is putting the same numbers up now and you say he has been less than stellar. There is documented proof that these same numbers were considered dominating the playoffs.   You are just talking shit and constantly trying to backtrack when you're proven wrong. "
"Didn't read, but is it that they're both equally likely to beat LeBron James in a game this postseason?"
LeBron James - 0 games with 0 points (1143 total games) 0% of games with 0 points  Anthony Davis - 18 games with 0 FTA (420 total games) 4.3% of games with 0 FTA (once every 25 games)  &gt;That's like Lebron scoring 0 points in a game.  Not quite...
An unfair reality he happens to be playing the same time that   1) LeBron is in the league   2) The following players are in their prime:   a) Arguably one of the ten most impactful offensive players of the past 30 years in Steph Curry   b) A generational talent......the 2nd most hyped one(and he's lived up to all the hype) to enter the league after LeBron in Kevin Durant( Greg Oden of course only being the one more hyped than him)   c) A guy in James Harden who the past 4 years is about to win MVP was players choice for MVP(2015) and could have easily won MVP(2017)   d) When healthy arguably rhe leagues best defender and a guy who averaged 26 a game on 61TS% last year in Kawhi Leonard   Such is life.....but let's also not act like Anthony Davis is better than LeBron/Durant/Curry/Harden just yet 
He was cramming it on everyone this season though. Not sure how he didn't look explosive to you. I believe he had back issues when he arrived in Cleveland which he's since worked out.  source: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22778062/how-lebron-james-fixed-back-track-play-all-82-games-nba   It's hard to compare his motor level because his role is so different than his Miami years

Lebron James
"Since 2000 the West has had a better head-to-head record vs the East all but ONE season. LeBron can keep the same stats, but he would have nowhere near the Finals appearances or win%. He has bounced around playing with all-star after all-star, even new ones in the same season to reach the Finals. No other great player has played with more all-stars than LeBron James. It actually isn’t even close. Then people have th audacity to cry about having no help. Laughable argument honestly. MJs third best player he EVER played with was who? Dennis Rodman who never scored even 6 ppg with the Bulls...?"
"Then they keep them. Harden and cp3 can make due with any rim running big, you think Capela is the crux of the Rockets?   I'm not saying losing Capela would be negligible (he's superb), but it wouldn't be team breaking if you ended up with LeBron James in the end. "
Lebron James is good at basketball. 
"Huh? Didn't Vegas odds and 538 favor them coming into the series? And how do they not have the better team? I know the Cavs have Lebron, but Kevin Love has been a no show for most of the playoffs and the Cavs'  second best player coming into the series was a 36 year old Kyle Korver. Talk about them all you want, but at least Lowry/DeRozan are consistent. The Raptors were the 1 seed, with HCA, won 60 games, and facing a Cavs team without Kyrie that had basically only been together for 27+7 games. So how were the Raptors not the clear favorites? And the answer isn't ""the Cavs have Lebron James,"" because basketball is a team sport"
"No, you're right, if you forget that Lebron James, the Warriors, and the Rockets exist - they're definitely not garbage. "
Lol you are so delusional.   Lebron has been added to a 47 win team. The 2009-2010 Miami Heat ring a bell? They went 47-35. The 2010-2011 Miami Heat went 58-24 and lost the finals...with Lebron James!   The single biggest reason Lebron will never surpass MJ is he up and leaves when his team can't help him win a ring. It's all about him and no one else matters. Theres a reason Kyrie left. 
"Yea I'll call bullshit. No team is concerned about how Lebron fits with their team lmao  Don't think he will come to Houston though if top dogs in the east want him.  &gt;“There was sort of a look of, ‘Why would we break this up right now?'  How about constant pressure he brings in the playoffs which is something we are lacking when everyone goes cold from the 3. He is the dominant force of scoring at will we do not have when Harden isn't getting foul calls and the opposing team is shutting down the pick and roll. The fact that if you double team Lebron James you are giving Harden a great look down the lane as also open shooters as a threat, Vice Versa. No one with a brain thinks Lebron would ever be a detriment to the Rockets. LBJ + Cp3 + Harden being able to control the ball with shooters will look like the Harlem Globe Trotters."
"I see where you're coming from, but at the same time, it's LeBron James. He just carried a team out of the first round against a better team than his own... in his 15th season.   Cp3-harden-lebron would be unstoppable"
"As long as they keep their core + some wings, it would amazing. LeBron+shooters is unstoppable on offense, but has historically been lacking on defense. Imagine a lineup of Pa/Harden/James/Any two of Ariza/Tucker/Mbah a Moute. Elite defending 3-5, and can switch those three positions easily. Against the GSW death lineup, put Harden on Iggy, LeBron on Draymond, CP3 on Curry and the two wings on Klay and KD. Switch off ball screens for Klay, switch almost every Steph P&amp;R. If they start spamming Curry/KD pick and roll, put a wing on Curry and switch.   On offense, just pick and roll the defense to death. You have three of the top 4 pick and roll ball handlers in the league. Have them take turns on offense. Remember the article Zach Lowe wrote about the Kyrie-LeBron pick and roll? He can repeat that with both CP3 and Harden. Any combination of those 3 is deadly. No one will tire out a lot, as they won’t have to handle the ball every possession, leading to increased effort on both offense and defense. Its LeBron+ shooters on steroids. They could also run some plays in the post for LeBron, he’s almost unstoppable there one on one and if you help off someone, its an open three.   Really, defensively shouldn’t be an issue because of personnel, and on offense he’s already playing almost the same system, the biggest difference would be less post touches, being used as the roll man more and not having to handle the ball as much, which should lead to giving more effort on defense(he used to be elite) and everyone will handle the ball less on offense, so they all should have more energy and be better handling the ball. A 120 ortg and 105 drtg would be possible."
"The reason why I believe LeBron is the greatest of all time is based on nights like this one.   When he plays like he did against the Raptors, I find it hard to argue that, as an overall, pure, player (not taking into account trophies etc) there's anybody better. He's the best passer of the ball I've ever seen, his athleticism is nearly unmatched, his work ethic is untouchable, his ability to score is so dynamic and well rounded that it's terrifying to watch sometimes.   I feel truly privileged to get to watch LeBron James play basketball, and I hope he continues for many more years. A once in ever player."
"In a league setting with different teams, there are the teams that are the best over all and then there is the THE team that counter's your particular team the most, and thus makes them the hardest opponent.    The Pacer's in my mind were the Cav's toughest opponent.  Toughest match.  Hardest competition (outside of the West of course).  The Raptors are good, but they are in no way the sort of competition the Pacer's were able to give the Cavs.  Which makes it easy for Lebron.    Think about it.  You have a grueling 5+ game series with a team that looked like they might pull it out and win.  Lebron fought tooth and nail that series and put up 40+ a game.  Now in Toronto there is no Oladipo to worry about.  Combine that with that thousand yard stare he put on Derozan and all of a sudden James looks very confident.  The sort of confidence that says,   ""Compared to the last team...this shit is easy""    And it is.  The Pacer's made the Cavs very tough going into the later playoff series.  I dont think any other team in the East can put the sort of pressure on Lebron that the Pacer's were able to achieve.  They were able to make him visibly frustrated and even got a tech out of him.  Toronto is not on that level.  There is no Lance to blow in Lebron's ear."
"Lebron James: 34/10/9  I think we have a winner, but let’s go a bit further. Lebron is having a historically great year for any age.  He’s also got a 35 PER 2nd in history to himself and 16.5 BPM which is also second to himself. He’s having the second greatest playoffs we have ever seen from a statistical standpoint and he’s 33."
&gt; Go ahead. Mock Lebron James.  Or what? We did that before this game and then locked him down. What's gonna happen now?
not to be dramatic but from this game alone I can conclusively say the celtics are the greatest team to ever play basketball and LeBron James is overrated
"LMAO nice spin with the thread title  how about the REALITY of his performance:  #LeBron James 5-16, 0-5 from three, 7 turnovers, -32 +- and just 2 assists in the second half"
"Mostly they do, but even in that I think it stays a bit funny.  People before the game: ""LeBron James CAN'T be stopped! He can't! He swept the Raptors! He will kill you anytime he wants to! It's impossible! Marcus Morris is so funny to act like they could!"".  People after the game: ""well Cavs just couldn't make a shot, nothing interesting, just part of the game sometimes you lose by 30"".  With a setup that good, you can write anything and the joke will work."
Oooh LeBron James post-game press conference!
"#LeBron James 5-16, 0-5 from three, 7 turnovers, -32 +-"
Who would have thought Marcus Morris would outscore Lebron James in Game 1 of the ECF.
I don't wanna be here. -Lebron James
Go ahead. Mock LeBron James. 
"""haha this idiot Morris thinks he can defend James...watch Lebron absolutely destroy him tomorrow"" - r/nba  James: 5-16 from the field, 0-5 from deep and 7 Turnovers"
Lebron James 35+ points 7+ rebounds 7+ assists ? Cavs might win : Cavs won't win 
"""haha this idiot Morris thinks he can defend James...watch Lebron absolutely destroy him tomorrow"" - r/nba  Lebron 5-16 from the field, 0-5 from deep"
"Yep you heard it here first folks.  It hath be declared by u/-Luka_Doncic- on the 13th day of May that one LeBron James is no longer a part of the ""GOAT"" discussion.   He hath spoken it. So it shall be Law.  Edit- IDK what month it is lol"
Jason Tatum &gt; everybody on cavs besides Lebron James
"LEBRON JAMES IS NOT A TOP 5 SCORER IN THIS GAME.  LOVE, TATUM, BROWN, MORRIS, AND HORFORD HAVE MORE"
What's cooler than being cool??? LeBron James!
LeBron James? I don't even know who the fuck that is.
MARCUS MORRIS HAS MORE POINTS THAN LEBRON JAMES
Lebron james? I dont know who the fuck that is
"Well... Now hear me out... I feel like a title is more significant and meaningful when won \*against\* the greatest player ever, not \*with\* the greatest player ever. What Eagles fans would want Tom Brady as quarterback? Even before February? The 76ers with LeBron James aren't the 76ers that they've been building towards for the past decade. They're just LeBron's next stop on the Guaranteed Title Tour. Does this all sound like nonsense? It might be. I'm drunk and emotional, for unrelated reasons."
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE JUST WITNESSED HISTORY.    A TRAVEL WAS CALLED ON LEBRON JAMES
"LeBron James confirmed worst player in NBA history. ""Not even a hot take,"" says u/dinerosobreputas"
Nothing like seeing Lebron put in that James Harden defensive effort. Love it. 
LeBron James and favorable calls from the referees when his team is staring at trouble. Name a more iconic duo.
LeBron James is why
it's because Lebron James
Kevin Love has scored more points than LeBron James.  Just like we all expected. 
Great pass by Lebron James to Baynes.
"Report: Lakers interested in trading for Kawhi Leonard, signing Lebron James and Paul George"
Wtf are you talking about. Paul George fits 0 teams better than LeBron fucking James
Marcus Morris 11/7/ at 50% shooting   LeBron James 12/6/9 at 33% shooting 
Brad Stevens &gt; Lebron James
"* Miami Heat are in surprisingly bad shape given how little they have to show for it. They're pretty much over the cap with only 6 players really (Whiteside, Olynyk, Johnson, Waiters, Dragic, Richardson). They can't even resign DWade and he's coming off that sweet, sweet Chicago buyout money, do they use up their MLE for nostalgia? Their future rests on Adebayo and Winslow, and Winslow is already almost off his rookie deal.   * Cleveland, if Lebron leaves. Even worse situation than Miami because of how they've bled draft picks. Like Miami they can probably rally into the bottom of the EC playoffs as a 6-8 seed behind a Hill/Love combo with some role players tossed in, but they've lost a lot of draft picks and have very little young talent to work with. They have to hit a home run with their lotto pick this year to have any kind of hope if Lebron leaves (especially if he goes to like Philly which won't have to do a sign and trade. At least with the Rockets they can probably get the 2020 and 2022 1st rounders to eat Ryan Anderson's contract in the sign and trade)  * OKC if George doesn't resign, but Melo opts in. On one hand, they'll probably just cut Melo immediately and it'll be 1 year of pain. But think of everything they gave up, to end up with nothing but a wasted 2018-2019 season (because the Melo cap hold will prevent them from doing anything), they're looking at an empty 9-11 finish in the West (just good enough to not be a useful lottery pick) and then having a 31-32 year old Russell Westbrook in 2019-2020 with nothing but Steven Adams as help and a $38 million a year cap figure. Ouch  * Detroit Pistons. I guess this depends on whether you think the Blake Griffin/Drummond pairing can be salvaged, but they make up 50-60% of the salary cap alone and neither is going anywhere for awhile. Either it works or it doesn't, and if it doesn't it'll be hard for them to either tank or move forward. It's a little ironic, because they were kind of in this situation before and the boldest thing Van Gundy did when he first came in is cut Josh Smith loose to try and move forward. Time really is a flat circle.   It gets a little harder to find a fifth, so I'll just do some honorable mentions that can kind of be lumped together.  * Portland * New Orleans  * Washington  All three teams are potential second round playoff teams, so they aren't in the same depressing boat as the above, but none of them have any clear path to get any better. No young talent expecting to make a huge leap or upcoming lottery picks, lots of long-term, hard to move contracts, no cap flexibility. This has consequences. Watch Portland spend too much on Nurkic (because they can't replace him if he walks), and New Orleans will be dropping a large contract on a big man coming off an achilles injury despite a potentially awkward fit. I, of course, think Cousins will come back and play his best basketball and the ""awkward fit"" will instantly turn into ""hard to defend"" and take basketball by storm....but I can see how objective outsiders may be more skeptical.  Washington went through this situation already last year when they had to drop $100 million on Otto Porter who, like Nurkic, good player, but not worth the contract he got.   I wouldn't call their situation bad, all three of these teams are going to produce multiple seasons of entertaining basketball and that's never worthless, but it's hard to see a different path forward for them outside of the teams they are now.  Incidentally, I *don't* think the Spurs are in as bad a shape as some people may think. If they have to trade Leonard, Leonard is worth a lot more than say a Lebron James sign &amp; trade. He's under contract, and while he can opt out in 2019-2020, he won't be a sign and trade. Anyone who doesn't want to pay SA's price would have to clear cap space for two seasons and hope they get him, that's a bold (and probably desperate) strategy.  If SA has to move Kawhi (who has a very friendly $20 million cap number) they'll be able to offload some deadweight with him. You're definitely getting Patty Mills alongside Kawhi.  Which means other than whatever young players they want to keep (Murray, White, Anderson, Betrans, etc) + Pau Gasol's $7 million buyout, they'll have a clear cap sheet in 2019-2020. "
"Lebron James and complaining about the same foul for 20 seconds, name a more iconic duo."
Lebron James not getting back on defense because he's too busy arguing with the refs. Pathetic.

There are people who unironically believe that LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time lmfao
Fuck no dude. Prime Kawhi is a finals MVP and beat Lebron James in the finals. Put prime Melo on that team and they don’t get out of WcF
It is when the guy getting open isn't Lebron James
We all have to fucking nut for LeBron James. But look fucking Marcus Morris is shutting his ass down. He still the GOAT? 😂
Lebron James is such a front runner. He's play so bad when things aren't going well.
this some of the most reactionary shit i’ve seen on this sub all day. the cavs have lebron james. don’t count them out yet just because of 24 minutes of basketball 
Can we recognize that Stevens is putting a fucking rookie on LeBron James right now in the ECF. And that it's working.  I mean... is there any shred of doubt that this man is the best coach in the league?
Marcus Morris &gt; LeBron James confirmed.
"Dude, if you have LeBron on board, Kawhi on trading block, you don't hesitate on freakin picks. You will be stacked with talent for 10 years, 3-5 with LeBron James. Who needs picks"
"After this half, Lebron James no longer has a higher PER than Durant OR Thompson.   "
lebron james using this trip to find real estate in boston...
8 years ago Celtics defeat LeBron James in the ECF and he leaves. Same fate happening now?
Lebron James is down 20+ to a team who is missing their two best players hahahaha
"Can we just get a pinned thread saying “[obvious] literally every team in the NBA interested in Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Paul George, etc.”"
Marcus Smart just stripped LeBron James
If we were talking about any other team in the league save the Warriors I'd agree. Man up and cheer for your team. You have Lebron fucking James
"First off, he hasn't won the NBA COY award (yet). So the first line of the article is misleading.  Next, just to give a bit of context:  - 2015-16: 56-win Raptors go to 6 games in the ECF against the Cavaliers, seen as a huge moral victory regardless. Future looks bright.  - 2016-17: 51-win Raptors swept by the Cavaliers in the 2nd round. That was tough.  - 2017-18: 59-win Raptors completely re-vamp their offence. Team looks far superior to anything else Casey has put on the floor in his career. The Cavaliers look to be the worst they've been since LBJ returned: we trend up, they trend down. And yet, we get swept. Two games we were in, two weren't even close.   Swept out of 3/5 playoff appearances, twice to the same team. Sure, we don't have the personnel to be competitive for a championship. But we sure as hell have the personnel to win ONE playoff game in TWO SERIES against LeBron James' Cavs.  "
"Tristan ""Lebron James"" Thompson"
"Anybody else cringe when they hear people call lebron ""king james""?"
LeBron James with the 2-6 LE PASSIVE MODE 
Definitely not. No way ~~cavs~~ Lebron James lets his team lose unless it goes to 6/7 games.
Mike Breen finally gets excited for someone that isn't named LeBron James
I think if the 76ers actually got LeBron that would mean moving Simmons (and possibly Fultz) for someone (Kawhi? / Paul George?). Probably would see kyle korver follow to whatever team he goes to like james jones.
Al Horford is better than Lebron James wow
"LeBron James isn't going to Philly. This is the new ""LeBron is going to the Lakers"""
Nah it'll be a healthy Celtics versus a LeBron James Rockets.
Al Horford is everything LeBron James is but 3 times better.

Does Boston need another championship to gloat about? And do I wanna hear about Lebron fraud ass James in the Finals?   Just kill me. 
"On this sub I always say shoulder into the chest is 99% of the time an offensive foul. Well guess what, Morris - James collision was that 1%  Morris came in from the side and bumped into James's path. And the collision was because of him. LeBron didn't even bump into him with his leading shoulder (right shoulder).  Edit: Alright guys I get it. It's Darren ""Collison""."
"""is clear that lebron James is a Marcus Morris stopper"" lmao"
"No it doesn’t. The thread is about James reaching 7 straight finals . Lebron probably doesn’t get to do that without those easy passes to the ECF every year.  He’s never had to play the warriors , spurs , Lakers etc. in the first or second rounds."
"This Celtics team is just as overrated if you think they have a chance in hell of beating these Cavs in a 7 game series. LeBron James is not getting knocked out by a team of rookies and Al Horford. I'm sorry, it's just not happening. He won't let it happen. This guy is in the conversation for GOAT and we're just supposed to act like that's even a question? I know we all want a competitive ECF but it's over. The basketball gods fucked us by injuring Hayward and Irving, so you might as well just lose hope for that now"
There is literally no scenario where adding Paul George to a team would make that team better than adding LeBron James. 
"One second y'all I got this   EVERY TEAM interested in trading for Kawhi Leonard, signing LeBron James  There fixed it. "
This comment makes me realize that LeBron wasted a golden opportunity naming his son LeBron Jr instead of Lil Bron James
I think he means Lebron James the basketball player and international icon
What we know now:  Gordon Hayward ... done.  Kyrie Irving ... done.  What we'll know after this series:  LeBron James ... DONE.
"It's crazy and I don't know why anybody on this sub would say any different. LeBron James isn't missing the finals to a team missing its two best players. He flew his way past the 60 win Hawks with a team that started Delly, Mozgov, and TT at the same time"

It’s LeBron James bruh FORGET Ben Simmons has everyone lost their MINDS
"Why not play Lebron off the ball with Simmons?  What I'm saying is, they both have similar skills with the ball in their hands. One can shoot and one cannot.  Why not then let Simmons act as the cheif ball handler. Defenses aren't going to collapse off Lebron James for two reasons: He can spot up or attack closeouts at a highly efficient level.  Another way of looking at it is, replace Ersan Ilyasova with Lebron James.  It wouldn't be a problem. "

Lebron is worth way more than a max contract. So you’d be getting Lebron James as a steal.  Think about that. Underpaying Lebron James

"lebron james should be 4x, he deserved it in 2015"
He's still in LeBron James head.  Must be lost there.
"Everybody is severely underrating how good Simmons is. LeBron and Ben would work well because they both have high bbiq. I know Ben has no jumper but the way people are talking about him you would think he’s on the same level of wiggins as a prospect.   Lebron is the GOAT in my eyes but if he demands you trade a kid who put up comparable numbers to Magic for a Kawhi rental then you end the meeting right there and say “This ain’t gonna work Mr. James.” I don’t care if Jesus Christ himself was a free agent, no GM should let a player dictate roster moves."
"You remember when [Lebron scratched Blatt's final play](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2460317-lebron-james-says-he-scratched-david-blatts-call-on-game-winning-shot-vs-bulls) against the Bulls in the playoffs, and then went on to [sink the game winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lswi2Y7L58M). It was the ultimate lose-lose situation for Blatt. The media was on his ass afterwards. At the end of the day though, nobody knows whether Blatt's play would've worked, too. Or whether he would've been blamed if Lebron missed the shot?"
I don't think any of these guys understand cap holds.    Anyways it's possible but extremely difficult.   https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/12/11/16761746/lebron-james-rockets-free-agency-salary-cap-how
"That Miami team is kinda weird. Lebron tried to hard not to fuck up so he fucked up until he accepted the villain role and he didn't like that.  He felt bad for leaving Cleveland, destroying his jerseys, crashed the downtown economy, the stigma of being hated. That was his prime and he choked over and over having to live with his only mistake he ever made to the public, he made it right and now I will allow him to go to Houston, he earned it.   Just my thoughts. Old ass players don't help tho, could u imagine if they still had James jones and mike miller!"
"First game I ever watched was Game 5 of the 2011 Finals where Dirk, J-Kidd, and Shawn Marion dismantled the Heat’s Big 3.   I was at my grandma’s house and my uncle came over. I was really young at the time and I had just started playing basketball on a church team a few months prior. My uncle had heard about me starting basketball so he turned on the game, thinking I’d be interested.   I watched it but understood none of it.   He asked me if I knew who LeBron James was. I was absolutely clueless.   He asked me who I was rooting for. I didn’t even know who the teams were. I probably didn’t even learn that the Mavs won until a few months later.   But that night, something sparked in me. Ever since, I’ve been an avid fan of the NBA. I remember nights when I’d stay up for hours upon hours reading Wikipedia pages about players, learning all the knowledge I could get. As soon as I finished one article, there’d be some tidbit in there about another player, and another, and another. Before you know it, I start at LeBron James and end up learning about Bob Cousy. It was crazy. And that’s how it’s been for me ever since. My love for basketball is always growing and always hungry for more. One day I’d love to even play in the league itself, just to prove that I could do it and do what I love for a living. But, that’s just a dream for now. "
KD took less money to keep the warriors warriors.  I don't see LeBron James doing it tbh
"I'm of this opinion as well. I wouldn't fault LeBron with choosing whatever means necessary to beat the Warriors and KD. The Warriors basically took care of their two biggest threats by signing KD; the Thunder and the Cavs. And Kevin Durant took care of his too biggest threats, the Warriors and LeBron James. "
"I think the current construction of the roster and org is absolutely the fault of Lebron James. Signing TT, JR, to shit tier deals, pissing off Kyrie enough to force a trade, chasing off David Blatt, chasing off his GM.    There's clearly a ""Lebron the basketball player"" and ""LeEverything Else"". LeBron the basketball player isn't hurting the Cavs but LeEverything Else has at the very least out the Cavs in a tough spot. It's been a long time coming and probably worth it since this team is salvageable and he won Clevland a ring but here it is.  "

Pau and Ben Wallace, would provide good interior defense alongside getting a decent amount of boards. I could have picked more modern bigs so they could space the floor more, but I think CP3 and Klay can provide adequate spacing by themselves. This starting unit is more than solid on defense and I'm relying on that more than anything here.  My bench is really just random tbh, but I find Michael Redd for $600 is a steal and a half, and Joel Embiid would be instant offense and defense off the bench. Baron Davis is only here to end another unfortunate souls career."
"1. LeBron James faced tougher competition.  Same argument for Jordan over Russell or Chamberlain.  2. LeBron hasn’t retired yet, goes to the Finals every year, and shows little sign of slowing down.  What if he keeps doing this until he’s 40?"
And none of this will matter once the playoffs start. The regular season has never meant less to a player than it does to Lebron James.

"Well, I guess we'd have to agree to disagree then. I think Curry was injured, as even Steve Kerr [implied it](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-finals-injury-lucky-cavaliers-lebron-james-081016). Has he not been injured, and had Green not been suspended, they would've won 4-1. Heck, had Curry not been injured at all, we would've been looking at a very different series.  Just look at Curry in the '17 finals. He was blitzing the Cavaliers with ease. Steamrolled TT and Love. "
My guess is that you started watching the NBA in 2015 and you've never watched pre-heat LeBron James.
Holy shit there is like an entire decade of players who couldn't get to the NBA finals because of LeBron James.  (Half of them)

The LeBron James effect
I mean Bleacher Report did put Davis as no.1 on the list of best players of NBA entering 2015 season over LeBron James so I think there's an argument he took that kind of jump
"Fair point, but to be fair, Parker just sucks at defense, he was never known for being a great defender. Lebron however is capable of being a beast defensively. While Pop will give players more freedom offensively, especially if they show that the reward is greater than the risk (like Manu's antics that you mentioned), he does not put up with lazy efforts on defense, period. He's always been that way, and he'll never budge. The Spurs have always been a defense first team. Maybe though, LeBron will be able to give more of an effort defensively if he played for Pop, considering he'd be playing less minutes, and would probably have more games off than he did with any other team he's played for.  I don't doubt that Pop would love James on his team, especially with how great of of a ball mover he is, it's just that IDK how Lebron would handle having less of a voice when it comes to FO decisions, and the fact that he'd have to practice and play defense in the regular season. Maybe they are able to work something out. Pop was able to mend his relationship with LaMarcus.  I'm not hating on Lebron, I love his game, and his BBIQ and vision would allow our offense to get to the beautiful game type of play when we last made the Finals. His game would allow him to age very gracefully, and Pop's minute management coupled with Lebron's durability would mean we could seriously get 8-10 years of solid productivity out of him, if he choose to stay here that long. I just don't think he'd fit in with the culture of this team. It would be weird though to see the Spurs getting national exposure though with him on the team. I'm so used to this team being under the radar."
75% of the league hasn't played in the league without LeBron James making the NBA Finals

"&gt;NBA&gt;Euroleague  Is really wide open to interpretation. Since we are talking about coaches, that has to speak to knowing how to play and adapt. I am bringing up that Dragic, Jokic, Nurkic, and others are from those places and they had the Euroleague as the closest league that they watched or learned from.   &amp;nbsp;  So when I said the best cerebral, it's not an automatic ""America does not have any"". It's not even relevant to the questions I have about Blatt and your assessment of his coaching ability being inadequate.   Let's not seek ways to be insulted. I am not trying to be, but I am, as I stated early, been always confused at this opinion and what transpired after 1 year. I will edit it with ""some"" since that's the conclusion some people are jumping to.    &amp;nbsp;  edit: after the way Blatt was publicly humiliated, I am not surprised he didn't look nor anyone offered:  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/cleveland-cavaliers-fire-david-blatt-lebron-james-shamed-nba-finals-012216"

"&gt;I mean the reason for this is that LeBron doesn't straight up disrespect Lue because Lue acts as LeBron's ""yes man"". Because of this, the rest of the team follows LeBron's lead and also does not disrespect Lue.   At least Lue had the balls to yell at Lebron/Kyrie/Love and challenge them.  &gt;With LeBron straight up disrecpecting Blatt, the rest of the team followed suit.  It wasn't only Lebron who had no respect for him. Even Haywood said this:  &gt;""Coach Blatt was very hesitant to challenge LeBron James,"" Haywood said. ""It was one of those situations where, being a rookie coach, and LeBron being bigger than life, it was a little too much for him. I remember we had James Jones (talk) to Coach about how, 'Hey, you can't just skip over when LeBron James makes a mistake in the film room.' Because we all see it.   &gt;""That's when … as a player, you start to lose respect for a coach. David Blatt can't come to a huddle and draw up a play that would get us a good shot,"" Haywood said. ""David Blatt doesn't understand sometimes substitution patterns.""  &gt;""The mistake he made against the Bulls when he didn't have the ball in LeBron's hands at the end of the game … There were obvious mistakes he was making, and you start to see it as a player, where 'We're going to have to win this on our own, because he can't do for us what Gregg Popovich can do for the Spurs.'""  Right from a player's mouth. Lebron and the other Cavs understandably had little respect for him as a coach. He seemed disorganized and too shook to challenge the big 3."

"Blatt was never going to get respect from anyone in the locker room when he acted like this:   &gt;According to Chris Haynes of cleveland.com, Blatt tried too hard ""to get in the good graces of his top talent."" He held back from criticizing members of his Big Three — James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving — and whistled players for ticky-tack fouls on his stars during practice.  &gt;Blatt alienated players trying to kiss up to LeBron and never won over his biggest star, who was dissatisfied with many of Blatt’s coaching moves and his European pedigree. In the end, though, it appears it wasn’t Blatt’s failure to win over LeBron as much as it was his failure to win the locker room. That created a disconnect between the players and coach, which GM David Griffin referred to at his news conference, and led to a ""lack of spirit"" that manifested not only in embarrassing losses to San Antonio and Golden State, but also after wins.  &gt;""Sometimes you can win games in this league in the regular season and get worse,"" Griffin said.

"Yeah I mean I'm not sitting here telling people to not hate Durant or to compare their situations, more just noticing that people seem to have really short term memories about The Decision. It was basically all anyone talked about, every old school player gave their 2 cents about it and how LeBron had taken the easy way out, etc.  It wasn't meant to be a comparison between the two players choices, just an observation that people just kinda like to hate shit, so they'll hate this Durant thing for a while until they forget or stop caring, then there will be some new thing they can hate.  This is direct from a bleacher report article in 2010:  &gt;Fans of legacy are also disappointed in LeBron for not being the hypercompetitive freak that MJ was, with the idea being that Jordan would never go play with his biggest rival. It would ruin the chance to crush them. **Bird and Magic never would’ve played together either. But LeBron and Wade will, which makes them not fit the narrative we have crafted about how basketball is.**  Source:  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/498277-lebron-james-the-miami-heat-and-the-season-legacy-died?source=rss_teams_Miami_Heat  I **completely** think the Durant decision was worse for a myriad of reasons. You obviously can't compare Durant joining the league's best team that he almost beat the year before.  My post was simply about people forgetting just how much flak LeBron actually for ""ruining the integrity of the game"" when he went to Miami. I honestly think LeBron got more shit than Durant did, because of The Decision, it being his home town, and the parade they threw.   Cavaliers fans were burning his jersey, and people have largely moved on already.  edit;  These are a couple top posts from the reddit thread when the decision went down.  &gt;Well, he might win 5, 6, or 10 championships, but he just threw away any chance he ever had to match or surpass Jordan's legacy, let alone Kobe, Magic, or any other all-time great. He'll be known as a front-runner who had to join forces with 2 other hall of famers to win his titles for him.  &gt;He just completely ruined himself. Went from being the next Michael Jordan, to just being a good nba player (who everyone except in miami will hate the fuck out of). fuck this, it ruins him and it ruins the nba. If they don't win literally 80 games next season they are a failure. I hope LeBron never wins a championship. Fuck this.  Notice the second comment. Look familiar?

"I know what you're saying, and let's agree to disagree since you feel otherwise, but I'm someone who believes in letting the people whose competence is actually managing a basketball team do their job, while players should stay in their lane.  Sure, you all pointed out the right things, but never has LBJ in his entire life been one to submit to his FOs wishes. Even in Miami he pulled LePolitics, he just got checked time and time again by Riley. We actually don't know what a LeBron James who actually doesn't sabotage his own team's management can do.   Like I said, the things you pointed our are all correct, but LeBron's way led him to 5 Finals losses. Maybe, just maybe, he should take a step back and let other people do what they're paid to do? "

"Flawed question is flawed. If you think these guys don't lift weights, I have a tiger-repelling rock I'd like to sell you.  Less snarky answer:  Most of these guys do the bulk of hypertrophy (building new muscle fibers) in high school, through college and into the first few years of their career. That's what pundits are talking about when they describe rookies needing to gain 15 pounds. Of course they're still running a periodized weights program in alternating cycles of hypertrophy(heavy weights), strength (sub-maximal, motor recruitment), and strength endurance, but the bulk of hypertrophy is done in those early years. [You can see that in a comparison of Lebron's body in 2016 vs his rookie season.](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/styles/marquee_large_2x/public/2016/12/06/lebron-james-evolution.jpg) He has good definition even then, but nothing compared to where he was even a few years later.  Not wanting to bulk up too much, because it limits mobility and jumping, players then transition into maximizing motor recruitment, efficiency of movement, and patching over any strength imbalances that pop up. Again, they've been doing this the whole time, but now they don't need hypertrophy as much, so more focus can be spent on other stuff. That means less heavy weight. They want to maintain and improve recruitment of the fibers they have, not build a lot of new ones.  Finally, you have the guys hitting the end of their career. The speed and the knees aren't there any more, so you see them try to drop weight to stay quick and durable enough for the league. Again, less hypertrophy, dropping muscle mass from the upper body preferentially while keeping the legs and core strong. "

"If Lebron James can average a 30 point triple double in the NBA finals at 32 against the best defense in the NBA at 42 MPG while playing at a faster pace than any game since 1990, I would rather just wait than bet against.

"Fair enough, guess we'll see. Recent history is on my side with this one though. 7 straight years don't lie.  Edit: 30 seconds to go in game 3 of the 2017 finals, KD just hit a big 3 to put the Warriors up 1. Kyrie dribbles the ball up court, waves off everyone to iso Klay Thompson, and pulls up a contested three with something like 16 seconds left on the shot clock. If Stevens really got through to him and he adopted a system and sticks to it then awesome and I'm wrong. But I think when the pressure of the playoffs is on I think he's going to revert to iso ball Kyrie. And yes, obviously that won the Cavs  a ring, but that was with LeBron fucking James pulling the other half of the load."
This isn't your typical run of the mill veteran lol..it's LeBron James  
Trading Julius Randle to get Lebron James does not make the Lakers worse wtf...  Also the Lavar/Lonzo drama is blown way out of proportion.

Lebron James and the Nets pick for Draymond Green who says no
"They put 09 Cavs on 6th place above the Lakers, Jazz, OKC &amp; Kings. Honestly, the Cavs were never projected to be where they finished in the league but astonishingly they made it to the ECF. And there's only one reason for that, LeBron James.    Now the Spurs, they were one of the teams considered to be a Finals contender (like every year because they're the Spurs) &amp; maybe a potential championship contender but never really *that* great of a team, to be put above the other teams on the list. OKC was much more of a favourite and also the Cavs were considered by many to be better than them. Spurs were never really the biggest favourite and certainly not #4 above LAL, OKC &amp; Kings (respective to the years they played). Tim Duncan was really aged too.  This also brings me to why the Lakers are placed really low on the list. Also, why 15'OKC isn't there then and why teams from the past aren't here."
When Lebron James went to the Cavs in 2014 
"I hope Cousins will be good. With that being said, Ha! Fuck you LeBron ""kosher hairline"" James"
IMO Nate Robinson's performances against the Lebron James Heat move him at least into top 4 (behind James- better than Lebron- Jones and Kyle Kristopher Korver)
"The year is 3413. Markelle fultz is still “2 weeks away.” The best nba player, LeBron James XVIII is the best shooter ever. He pulls up from the 8 point line better than any other human or alien player "
"Okay, okay, I know Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone and John Stockton were exceptions and maybe LeBron James is too.  I sure hope so.  But I still worry."
"Lebron owes his success to James Jones, it's no secret that Lebron only won rings once he teamed up with him. "
"1.  This is why I'm worried about LeBron James logging heavy minutes at his age.  2.  Cousins' superhuman effort against the Bulls, the first 40-20-10 stat line in 50 years (44 points, 24 rebounds and 10 assists with 4 steals, 1 block and a W), may have set him up for this devastating injury.  [Reddit rightly praised it at the time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7sbpd8/demarcus_cousins_drops_the_first_402010_stat_line/)"
"I think that it's ultimately kind of impossible to effectively compare across eras, and as such kind of impossible to isolate one GOAT player. The way I see it is you have a select group of GOAT tier players, all of whom have a real argument for GOAT based on their performance in their respective eras.  Imo GOAT tier is:  - LeBron James  Honestly in terms of raw ability I think prime LeBron is the greatest basketball player we've ever seen. Maybe the best physical specimen of all time, brilliant passer, game-changing defender, if he'd played before zone-defense was a thing he genuinely might have been even better.  - Michael Jordan  Self explanatory, transcendent scorer, all-time defender, led one of the greatest dynasties of all time, 6 rings+6 FMVP's, and his postseason numbers are disgustingly good. There's only one team that dominated the league harder than the Jordan Bulls did.  - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  6 MVP's, 10 finals, 6 rings, all-time leading scorer of the NBA, insane defender at the most important defensive position. It's a travesty how much Kareem gets left out of the GOAT discussion. To me he's the best big man of all time, and if I had to rank him he'd definitely be top-2 overall.  - Wilt Chamberlain  Just dumb stats, like dumber than dumb, like playing 2k on easy mode stats. Not to sound like a broken record, but holy shit look at those goddamn stats, what even.  - Bill Russell  Centerpiece of the most dominant franchise of all time. 11 rings, 8 straight finals wins, maybe the greatest defender of all time. I get that him and Wilt played in the BC days of the league, but with the dominance they showed I don't think you can leave them off this list."
For me it’s about how much you add to your team. If you add (hypothetically) 10 wins to your team but you have a losing record you were more valuable than Lebron James if he only added like 6. If it was possible to calculate it that way. 
"One team has LeBron James, and the other one doesn't."
imo he is among the leaders for mvp. James Harden is the leading candidate although he missed some time and Rockets still won. Kawhi is out. Steph and Durant have been in and out with sporadic good games. Kyrie has been winning but inconsistent individually with pedestrian averages. Lebron has been losing. Westbrook was losing too. Nobody has the perfect case.
If curry goes cold in some games in the playoff and yes he does like what happened in the finals two years ago he becomes less valuable. Lebron is a threat on both end pf the floor in every way even if he's cold. Just see The Block by James.
lebron teams always. Coaches get fired. Constant trade talks around teammates. Constant media hype and over-analyzing everything. The pressure to win when you have Lebron James is mentally ill. He seems to be the only one isn't affected by it.
"Lazy passes = not really. Flop in the paint = not really. He only flops (falls to the floor) on charges and only ever exaggerates contact on offense off ball when he gets in his post position wrestling matches. Almost all of his turnovers come from getting stripped on drives by a help defender or his own man  because he’s not Lebron James but wants to play like him. His handles just aren’t quite tight enough even though they’re the best handles at the C position in the league.  That said, when he drives there’s only 3 possible outcomes and two of them are good so we can live with the turnovers, we just needed to get better at getting some defenders back after he makes them. The 3 outcomes are high percentage shot near the rim with the possibility of a foul, kick out pass for open 3 when he’ll comes, or a turnover. "

"The Announcers:   HEY MELO, YOU'RE GREAT AND IMMA LET YOU FINISH, BUT LEBRON JAMES HAD THE BEST 30K MOMENT OF ALL TIME"
"I'll try to answer.  &gt; Okay... How are you not sick of the Warriors then?    Well, Lebron has dad dicked the east for almost a decade..whats he been to like 8 straight finals now? Warriors have been to three. So its not quite the same rate of prevalence in the finals.   &gt; Why will it be better to see them crush some other team?  I think the answer is because Celtics have thus far, this season, proven to be the best team in the East. Cavs surely cannot make that claim. As of today, Cavs are probably the 6th best team in the league. So for the finals, typically you want to see the two best teams play, and Cavs aren't in that category. Dubs would still be favored in that series, but the Celtics are a more competitive series against the Warriors than the Cavs are. Especially if Gordon makes a late season return, that series could be amazing.   Edit: I see I've pissed off lebron fans by simply trying to provide a reason for why people might want to see a different team than the Cavs in the finals. I know its easy to get lost in the noise of r/nba, but outside of this sub, the warriors are nowhere near as hated as they are here. There isn't as much viewing fatigue of Steph Curry, as there is of Lebron James. James is obviously still immensely popular, but the vitriol this sub has towards the warriors, is not the norm in r/outside. "
Torontos looking more playoff proof this year. But its still LeBron james.
"&gt; Of course the shots matter, but it is undeniable that the defensive intensity is greater in the Finals, not to mention the fact that Kyrie was doing it against 3 elite defenders in KD, Klay and Draymond.  The defensive intensity was *lower* for Kyrie because he was the \#2 option and had LeBron fucking James on the court with him for most of those shots (and Kevin Love spreading the floor).   &gt;Since the regular season stats from Nash's time don't show how far the closest defender was to him, the stats are at best inconclusive  There's absolutely no reason to assume that Nash, the clear-cut best player on his team and two-time MVP, faced less defensive attention than Kyrie did while playing second fiddle to LeBron. That's the exact *opposite* of a reasonable assumption. It's just grasping at straws to try and throw out hard numbers that show Nash was a more efficient finisher.   Even in 2006 when Amare was out for the season Nash still shot 70% at the rim. The idea that defenders were just ignoring him while he lit them up to focus on Barbosa and James Jones is absurd. "
They won a title because LeBron James was born in Akron. They’re still an absolutely awful franchise.
It's going to 6 games either way. I will say cavs because they have lebron James and he is the best player in the league.
Most surreal moment I've witnessed was the AT&amp;T Center giving LeBron James a standing ovation 
"&gt; Yup. He was. Multiple times. used to fight with those people all the time in top 5 point guard threads.  There are arguments for guys all the time, but go on twitter, go on instagram. ESPN and casual fans think he was one of the best players last year. He gets tons of love. Having some victim complex as a Kyrie fan is insanely insecure. People have opinions, but it's not like this was some wild conspiracy theory. Take a look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6o1z9k/after_hundreds_and_thousands_of_ratings_here_is/). Kyrie is ranked as the 6th best PG, behind Curry, Westbrook, Harden, Wall and CP3. He only really has an argument over Wall. Curry westbrook and Harden all are better than Kyrie at most things and CP3 is a great defender plus doing a lot of the same things. That's where most people rank him. End of conversation.  &gt;People need to stop being so obssessed with positions. There arent even really positions in the NBA anymore  I mean shit if you're going to be bitching about how people classify him then be consistent. He's not a true PG, he doesn't distribute the ball, and he's an ISO scorer. Whatever the state of positions is, he's not a true PG regardless.  &gt;When theres a faction of posters that think trash ass lowry is better than Kyrie freaking Irving, then theres a problem. There was definitely a group of Kyrie skeptics on reddit and you are playing revisionist history by saying there wasnt.  Not thinking he's as good as Lowry is not the same as thinking he's not good. Also that's a super biased opinion because they really weren't that far apart last year. check the numbers [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kyrie+Irving&amp;player_id1_select=Kyrie+Irving&amp;y1=2017&amp;player_id1=irvinky01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kyle+Lowry&amp;player_id2_select=Kyle+Lowry&amp;y2=2017&amp;player_id2=lowryky01&amp;idx=players). Idk why you're acting as if Kyrie is a landslide better player when they both scored similar numbers on similar efficiency. I think Kyrie is better but acting like that's a terrible opinion is just your bias.  &gt;Better supporting cast top to bottom? His supporting cast doesnt have lebron james so thats some bullshit.  The Celtics are a deep, good, well coached team. Literally the only think the Cavs have that the celtics don't is Lebron. Celtics have 2 All Stars, a ROY candidate, great role players etc. He's not on a struggling team.  &gt;Coaching has nothing to do with it.  Oh stop it. Celtics kept 3 fucking players from their #1 seed team and still end up being just as good if not better. The Celtics made IT a 29 ppg scorer, and now Crowder and Bradley are having poor seasons. Coaching is a huge advantage. Stevens is a much better coach than Lue.  &gt;Speak for yourself. I feel super vindicated since everyone was wrong about him last year.  You feel that way because you have a bias (as I showed in the majority opinion of Kyrie). He's putting up the same stats on an already great team. He was a good player and he's still a good player. Nothing has changed."

Better supporting cast top to bottom?  His supporting cast doesnt have lebron james so thats some bullshit.    Of course i wanted to vent.  Its annoying that people only started to realize how good he is now that hes on a different team even though hes playing the exact same game.  Coaching has nothing to do with it.   &gt;There is no vindication here.  Speak for yourself.  I feel super vindicated since everyone was wrong about him last year. "
It's less of that and more of he had lebron fucking James on the same team
Is George starting? Or is he just on the team. I heard Lebron will get to pick who starts. I think putting Westbrook in would be a decent move.   A line up of Westbrook-Irving-Durant-James-Davis would be a solid line up.   It’s like a couples get away retreat with 3 couples but AD’s partner sadly tore his Achilles so he can’t make it and now AD is gonna be a 5th wheel and have to play mediator to two dysfunctional couples in Bron/Kyrie &amp; Kd/Russ. 
LeBron James did that last year against the wizards in the playoffs with the game on the line. 
Kemba Walker has never in his career beaten LeBron James in a game of basketball. That'll do it
"when the player is at their smartest but still within their athletic prime, see: lebron james ecf the last few years. The player may not be peak athleticism but they have so much experience and smarts they still dominate"
I think the craziest part is that most people STILL expect Cleveland to make and win the Easter Conference Finals. That's the power of Lebron James I guess regardless of the dysfunction the team is currently seeing. 
"The cavs are non stop drama this year.  I live near Oakland so I’m not a fan but I still think they win the east and give the warriors all they want in the finals.  Injuries, mid season lost of interest, drama, whatever it is, it won’t stop a Lebron James team in the playoffs."

"With lebron sure, if people want to hate him for doing TV interview for 40 minutes where he announced his next career move and raised millions of dollars for charity. Sure people had some right to feel some type of way about it.   With KD, he had no reason at all to stay loyal to OKC. They destroyed a dynasty because the owner was too cheap to pay James Harden 6 extra million dollars (and didn't want to go into luxury tax after just making the finals). He loved the city, their fans, but he made the right choice for his career and his overall happiness.   LeBron didn't have any reason to stay loyal to Cleveland either, they wasted the first 7 years of his career.   Players make moves to help themselves, as they should. "
"Which is why he gets a pass, since he's so damn good. It's not the same because Lebron James is an expert at crafting his image. Yet every single one of his teams has ridiculous amounts of turmoil. It always just looks like it's everyone else's fault and his defenders are determined enough to defend his actions to the death.   Boogie whines to the refs and gets techs. Thats about it.

THE NBA THIS YEAR IS ON FIRE  NO NEW FRIENDS  **LIST OF PEOPLE THAT DISLIKE ENES KANTER:**  1. The fans of the Utah Jazz  2. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  3. Kevin Durant  4. LeBron James  5. Devin Booker  6. Jared Dudley  The list keeps growing every day!
"Ah, the generational players: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, KAJ, Magic Johnson, Micheal Jordan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, DeMarcus Cousins"
LeBron James and Gordon Hayward 
"I was going to reply seriously but before commenting I read some of your replies sooo...  Paul George, LeBron James and then you trade Clarkson, Nance Jr and Randle for Davis."
"Look at Kyrie's numbers for the 2016 Finals...if that doesn't scream ""duo"" you're crazy.  Irving and James essentially matched one another offensively and Kyrie was such a tough cover it enabled James to facilitate.  Kyrie matched James offensively in every game they won except Game 6, the Tristan ""maybe we should trade Kevin Love"" Thompsan game.  Furthermore in the games they lost, James and Irving were equally bad.    Like I said, James did his share of the lifting, but if ever there was a case for Co-MVPs that was it.  James and Irving complemented one another perfectly when they were on in that series but LeBron needed Kyrie just as much as Irving needed him.  "
People talk about that Kyrie 3 as if that just magically gave Lebron the ring. Just look at his stats in the playoffs/finals. Dude balls harder than anyone.   https://i.pinimg.com/474x/8b/d8/1a/8bd81a50eb70b4f479f5a77d891c133d--lebron-james-stats-nba-finals-.jpg  This tells you why he gets the glory. 
"2012 they smashed on OKC, but 2013 just like 2016 could have gone either way and I think it's ridiculous he gets all the credit when Ray and Kyrie bailed him out on one end while Kawhi, Manu and Timmy all blew easy ones or FTs and Draymond was a dumbass.  LeBron did more than his share of the heavy lifting but it's absurd the way James gets all the glory the years they won and none of the blame the years they lost.  I can't blame Kyrie for wanting out.  It was ""his fault"" he was hurt in '15 and Cleveland lost and yet it was James and James alone they won in '16 despite the fact that the series literally came down to an Irving three in Game 7 and Kyrie balling out down 3-1 helping James lead the comeback.  It's like folks forgot he quit against Boston in 2010, dude has been just as bad as he's been good.    Kyrie got the Kobe treatment a la the Shaq-Kobe era.  Both were true duos but the media shoved the Batman and Robin rhetoric down our throats to incite drama.  "
"Hello! I am qualified to answer this. Hippa still applies. If there is something major that has to take place like a life saving intervention (say, LeBron James was in a car wreck and needed cpr), there's a procedure for stars and well-known people called ""break the glass"" that allows medical personnel access to any/all data, but they still must be as discreet as possible. And every single file and page you look at for ANY patient is tracked to your user ID, whether you're using EPIC or another ecosystem for patient care.  If anything the secrecy of high profile people is MUCH more tightly guarded than normal. If we get a famous person in our setting, the security is extraordinary. No one cares if Joe schmoe had a heart attack but if we admitted a movie star and that got out, massive fines would ensure and heads could roll, even and up to doctors and senior administrators.  ""Break the glass"" allows medical care to assume saving lives takes precedence over secrecy. Anything you hear about a star is relayed through the publicist or other figure that has the legal authorization to release that information. "
"Someone will offer him the max. Maybe not the Pelicans, but someone. Injury discounts only work when there’s no risk of another team offering more. Bulls, Pacers, Lakers, Mavericks and Hawks will all have the money, though they may wait for decisions from Paul George and LeBron James first."
"Not after Colorado.  The reason the media hyped LBJ so hard since the day he came info the league was to draw attention away from Bryant who many saw as MJ's heir to the throne up to that point, especially after the threepeat.  Colorado turned a lot of folks against Bryant though and the NBA scrambled hard for a ""clean"" star to carry the league in Jordan's absence.  From that point on until the back to back chips the media always painted Kobe as a villain.  His '08 MVP, leading Team USA to Gold in 2008 and winning two more titles forced the media to accept him but you could always tell it frustrated them.    Not to take anything away from James as he's a phenomenal talent, but never have I seen so many excuses made for a player of his caliber in the NBA.  It's always because of him when his teams win but never his fault when they lose as opposed to Kobe.  During '08-'10 it was his fault when we lost in '08 but according to the media, ""no way we win without Pau, Fish, LO, Ariza or Artest"" the following two years.   It always amazed me how game recognized game though.  During LBJ's last days in Cleveland before the decision and during his first few seasons in Miami, no matter how hard the media tried to portray James as being superior to Bryant the players always picked Kobe over LeBron.  "
LeBron James with that Westbrook quadruple double tonight! 
Thanks for this.  It's like any time anyone brings up cultural differences between races the (white) people get all defensive like it's not Kevin's fault or hey they have to try too!  All we're saying is Kevin Love's uncle was literally a beach boy. LeBron James doesn't even know who his father is. It's different. Surface shit like going to movies and stuff won't help you feel apart of something that you don't even know exists. It takes time. 
If lebron James was chris Paul size?
"I was skeptical as well, but google found me this article.  Seems like it's legit  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/opinion/sunday/in-the-nba-zip-code-matters.html?_r=0   &gt; Growing up in a wealthier neighborhood is a major, positive predictor of reaching the N.B.A. for both black and white men.   &gt; Putting all the information together, my best guess is that black N.B.A. players are about 30 percent less likely than the average black male to be born to an unmarried mother and a teenage mother.   &gt; From 1960 to 1990, nearly half of blacks were born to unmarried parents. I would estimate that during this period roughly twice as many black N.B.A. players were born to married parents as unmarried parents. In other words, for every LeBron James, there was a Michael Jordan, born to a middle-class, two-parent family in Brooklyn, and a Chris Paul, the second son of middle-class parents in Lewisville, N.C., who joined Mr. Paul on an episode of “Family Feud” in 2011.   &gt; These results push back against the stereotype of a basketball player driven by an intense desire to escape poverty. In “The Last Shot,” Darcy Frey quotes a college coach questioning whether a suburban player was “hungry enough” to compete against black kids from the ghetto. But the data suggest that on average any motivational edge in hungriness is far outweighed by the advantages of kids from higher socioeconomic classes. "
He would basically be LeBron James with slightly better shooting 
LeBron with the James Harden quadruple double.
(Lebron) James is an ass and we won't be working with him anymore!   ftfy
OKC TRADES WHOLE TEAM LESS RUSSELL WESTBROOK FOR LEBRON JAMES
"Nets pick TT and Shumpert for Lebron James, who says no?"
"""Teacher, when was history created?""  ""That's a very good question, hypothetical child. History was created in June of 2016, by LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Steven Adams's balls. Before that point is what's called, 'prehistoric.' That means nothing was ever written down formally. Stories and lessons were passed down generation to generation verbally, or through cave paintings, like that famous one of Allen Iverson stepping over a merman. While some stories passed down this way are surely apocryphal, like everyone's favorite tall tale of the Knicks not sucking for some period of the 1970s, others are absolutely true, like when we talked about Manute Bol being able to tie his penis in a knot. The problem with prehistoric time is that false beliefs weren't fact checked in the way they are today on instagram. So you'd hear crazy theories about spherical heavenly bodies and 'gravity.' Thankfully, once history was created nearly 2 flat-spin phases ago, we've been settling on universal truths at an astonishing rate.""  ""I'm not sure I get it.""  ""That's understandable, here's a video featuring our two favorite historians, Steven Adams's Balls, to help explain""  *Powerpoint intensifies, mate*"
Lebron Magic James
Lebron “Lebron James” James 
Bruh we got my dad from the Y guarding Lebron James
"Have you ever seen a more lopsided battle physically than Bojan ""Dad bod"" Bogdanovic vs. Lebron ""Once in a lifetime athlete"" James?"
lebron james = cavs good!
"Anyone who claims to be able to predict what Lebron James is going to do is full of shit, this includes 90% of sports media "
So Lebron having two instances in a heated series with little to no actual history of extended dirty play is comparable to a guy who spent an entire season kicking people in the nuts and injuring some? Yeah it is pretty funny you try to scapegoat James to excuse greens dirty play. I don’t even like Lebron and you can call him a lot of things like a flopper or drama queen but dirty isn’t one of them. When you don’t have an extended history of dirty plays you can get the benefit of a doubt 
"In a better world Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, and Jimmy Buckets lead the Bulls to electric Finals matchups against Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook's SuperSonics. Instead we have Lebron and co. vs. Dallas, OKC, SAS, and GSW for a decade. I made myself sad"
That is true! I did not account for that. I think then LeBron will still stay at #22 then behind James Harden and Klay Thompson. Oh well. Props to Harden and Klay.
1. Kevin Durant (Team LeBron)  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo (Team Steph)  3. Anthony Davis (Team LeBron)  4. James Harden (Team Steph)  5. Kyrie Irving (Team LeBron)  6. Joel Embiid (Team Steph)  7. DeMarcus Cousins (Team LeBron)  8. DeMar DeRozan (Team Steph)  **Reserves 1st Pick:**  Klay Thompson (Team Steph)
"The Cavs signed them to such team-unfriendly deals ~~because Lebron James is a fucking diva and either thought he was screwing over Dan Gilbert or b/c Lebron was also getting a cut of the action.~~ because they won a championship and Gilbert was willing to spend. It didn't matter if no one else was offering that much money because they were holding up negotiations. Tristan Thompson's contract wasn't signed until the season started, becuase he wouldn't accept less than $80 mill. Once the season started, LeBron pushed for the front office and TT to get the job done.   We're stuck with them because they had steep dropoffs. Otherwise, we'd be rolling with them without considering trade scenarios. And if LeBron leaves, it won't matter if those guys are stuck with us because we can wait out their contracts during the rebuild.  Like I keep saying *this only affects dan gilberts pockets*"
"""Dan Gilbert was willing to spend whatever it took to keep the team together.""  The only reason I am repeating that is to make it clear to you that I am comprehending what you are repeating.   Now, let me repeat, nobody was going to pay anywhere close to what the Cavs paid to retain those players.  The Cavs could have signed them to much more reasonable deals and still retained them because, lets be honest, they weren't going to take less money to play on a lesser team.    The Cavs signed them to such team-unfriendly deals because Lebron James is a fucking diva and either thought he was screwing over Dan Gilbert or b/c Lebron was also getting a cut of the action.   Because they are now signed to such albatross contracts, those players are untradeable and the Cavs are stuck with them until those contracts near expiration or they continue to sell their draft picks.  "
"Also missing Pau Gasol, who was drafted 3rd overall in 2001. This whole list is kinda bullshit because of the fact that Duncan played 4 years in college and so most of his top competitors in his prime were drafted before him. That ends up ruling out the following top 3 picks from title teams post Duncan draft: Jordan (1x champ post Duncan draft), Shaq (4x champ), Billups (1x), Kidd (1x). So you're cutting out key players from 7 championship teams as well as Duncan's 5 titles. That's 12 of 20 teams excluded.   Here are the 8 remaining eligible championship teams and where their key players were drafted:  * 2008 Celtics -- Kevin Garnett (#5), Ray Allen (#5), Paul Pierce (#10), Rajon Rondo (#21) * 2009 Lakers -- Kobe Bryant (#13), Pau Gasol (#3), Lamar Odom (#4), Andrew Bynum (#10) * 2010 Lakers -- see above * 2012 Heat -- Lebron James (#1), Dwyane Wade (#5), Chris Bosh (#4)    * 2013 Heat  -- see above * 2015 Warriors -- Steph Curry (#7), Klay Thompson (#11), Draymond Green (#35) * 2016 Cavs -- Lebron James (#1), Kyrie Irving (#1), Kevin Love (#5)   * 2017 Warriors -- Steph Curry (#7), Kevin Durant (#2), Klay Thompson (#11), Draymond Green (#35)  So ~~3~~ 2 of the 9 teams didn't feature a top player who was a top 3 pick. Of these top players, all but Draymond Green were lotto picks. 13 of 17 were picked in the top 5."
“We got that good relationship”  ESPN: LEBRON JAMES IS CONSIDERING JOINING THE THUNDER THIS OFFSEASON TO BE WITH HIS GOOD FRIEND WESTBROOK
Can you imagine Kevin Love and LeBron James being on the same team during the regular season? That would be insane.
"I'm not poo-pooing on signing those players.  I'm saying that they were signed to enormous deals that no one else was offering, only to appease Lebron James.  Now, they are stuck with those contracts.  And when Lebron James leaves Cleveland again this summer, those are going to be the only players left behind and the Cavs are still going to be paying a luxury tax. "
Lebron James is the greatest player to ever play basketball. 
"LeBlock.  The block itself was amazing, but the context really elevates it. It came in the climax of the fourth quarter of Game 7 of the NBA finals, tons of lead changes, with the Cavs coming back from 1-3, beating the team with the best regular season record in history, and Lebron James fulfilling his promise and his redemption story for Cleveland.  That game had it all."
"&gt; I love how you talk like the Raptors have accomplished more than the Celtics.  I love it too because it's true.  &gt; But who expected anything different?  And we were expected to beat Lebron James the last two years? I missed the part where we were favourites.   &gt; go to your team's subreddit and they'll tell you the same thing in the game thread  Obviously there's going to be salt after a loss like this. We've had a bad stretch of 1-2 weeks. It's our real first bad stretch since January, it happens. Not worried. Good night. "
"[The NBA's contested shot stat is bunk.](http://www1.vantagesports.com/Articles/article_view/ViAAjSEAAFIWKwSG) It's especially useless for deciding whether a jumpshot was contested or not. Honestly, I don't trust any stat that NBA teams don't use.   &gt; Russ does better in some all-in-one metrics but that's almost solely because of his rebounding, much of which comes from free boards gifted to him by Adams so he can start a fastbreak (and even more of which are a result of him being out of position to contest, which results in an open shot as often as it does a rebound).   Defensive rebounding alone doesn't give him *that* much of a boost in advanced defensive stats. The reason those stats like him is not just because of boards, but because he plays next to a perrenial DPOY in Roberson. Before Roberson's emergence, Russ's defensive stats were not good.  &gt; then why does he have a worse a/to?  I understand homerism, but there's literally no argument here. Westbrook is the superior facilitator. If we go by raw a/to, then Dame is leagues better than LeBron at facilitating.   Russ drives more, passes for assists more (he leads the league in potential assists), and has a higher USG% overall. Obviously, his TOV% is going to be higher. This is almost the same exact case for James Harden, stat for stat. And Dame certainly can't playmake like the Beard.  Overall, I absolutely agree that Dame is having a better season. But you don't really present a compelling argument here. Dame is mostly just a better scorer."
"&gt;No PEDs whatsoever. He’s pure as the new driven snow.   LOL nobody is denying Bron never took PED's. Literally anyone can take PED's or other shit, especially any athlete, but who else is even remotely like LeBron James? Dude's 6'9 260+lbs of pure muscle, super strong, yet super agile and fast, outjumps and outpaces everyone with all that physique. Dude's also one of the smartest player ever, highest of the highest BBIQ.   &gt;   He might have done PED's, of course. Maybe even more shit, but guess what? Anyone can do that. But there's only one LeBron. That's why he's mostly a genetical freak with godly talent, durability and work ethic. Otherwise i could do PED's right now, yet i can never be LeBron, no one can. It's that fucking simple kid, learn to use ya brain. It's free"
"My first season really watching the NBA was 09-10.  I’m a Jazz fan so I got to watch that Boozer/D-Will team put in work.  The highlight of that season by far was the D-League call up Sundiata Gaines taking over for an injured Deron Williams and willing the Jazz to a victory over LeBron James and the Cavaliers with a buzzer beating 3 at the end of the game, the first three-pointer of his NBA career.  It was all just too surreal; a D-Leaguer dueling the reigning MVP?  AND coming out in top?  That’s gotta be fake, but it wasn’t, I watched it happen in front of my eyes and went nuts.  One of 3 NBA moments that still give me chills, one other being Brandon Roy’s last hoorah against Dallas"
Lebron James is going to crawl back into the championship series isn't he?
Lebron James easily
"Because he's been young enough to do that. As he ages he's gonna look at longer contracts. Maybe it's this one, maybe it's the next. At 33 I wouldn't take any chances outside of one with player options as soon as the 2nd year.  &gt; even a heavily declined LeBron James will be a very very good role player.  Which is the issue. You don't want to be paying insane money for anything outside of a superstar. That's how team hamstring their roster and can't make any moves then get stuck in mediocrity."
because lebron never signs long term. he signs short contracts all the time. and even a heavily declined LeBron James will be a very very good role player. 
You don't think that LeBron fucking James has a better chance to be top 5 even though he's #2 already? 
"Hayward isn’t LeBron James Or Kevin Durant. He’s a star player but he’s not going to make the raptors chances against the Celtics 0, they’re fairly even matched teams. Also you’re implying that Hayward is going to stop LeBron James lol."
The East belongs to Lebron James. The West belongs to the Warriors. Everything else is child speak.
"Fam, LeBron James ripped me off once!"
"LeBron James could probably make YOU average 15 a game lol, let's see what he can facilitate on his own before we call people delusional"
"I mean as you can see I’ve been downvoted into oblivion for thinking there’s better use of our cap.   I just think putting this team on the “championship or bust” mentality next season is too much. I love Lebron James, but I don’t want the headaches that come with him. "
"Since you marked this as serious, let's answer this seriously.  ----  **Your main point:**  &gt; As a black person who used to enjoy posting on here, I find it more and more difficult to reconcile coming on here when this sub has the tremendous racial bias that it does. It’s been going on for a long time, but is getting increasingly worse as time goes on.  Okay, let's look at your claims.  ----  **Claim 1:**  &gt;Black coaches are routinely disparaged and looked at as incompetent buffoons on here, which started as mild mending but has evolved into much worse.    Do you have examples, or are you just going to say this? [Posted today about Doc Rivers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8alzww/doc_rivers_ive_coached_a_long_time_18_years_or/dwznsna/) That doesn't sound like racial bias. This sub was pissed (along with the players) when David Fizdale was kicked off. Dwane Casey is widely being considered in the race for COTY. Alvin Gentry has gotten praise while he was working with the warriors coaching staff, and has had mixed reviews since being a head coach; coincidentally, the Pelicans have also had a mixed performance as a team. Nate McMillan isn't mentioned too often, but then again, the Pacers aren't mentioned as often as a lot of other teams. And the joke about Tyronn Lue is that he's not the real coach and Lebron James is- do you really want to suggest that ""lol this guy who's black isn't the coach, but this guy (who's also black) actually is."" Is THAT truly reflective of racism? Or is that just pointing to the fact that Lebron James understands the game of basketball and his team better than the head coach, which is not really a stretch of the imagination?  ----  **Claim 2:**  &gt; Players are looked at as uneducated and irresponsible, and even implicated as gang members without proof on threads that pop up daily.  Again, are you going to post proof of this? Where are these comments? How much support do they get? What's the nature of them: serious or joking? If we're talking about the raw academic education of these players- a lot of them aren't that educated! They go through high school and a few years of college, and it's well known that their focus is not really on academics, but on their craft of basketball. At the same time, a lot of players are celebrated for their BBall IQ. I've never seen random gang member comments celebrated. If you're going to claim ""without proof"" on threads, then you would do well to provide proof yourself.  ----  **Claim 3:**  &gt; Not only that, European players are consistently overrated and any slight criticism of players like Jeremy Lin gets met with brigading and even bans.  Again proof? Which european players are being consistently overrated? Do you think people are just excited to see players from underrepresented places be celebrated on the biggest stage in basketball? Are you saying that the people are casually racist against black people but then celebrate other minorities joining the fray?  ----  **Claim 4:**  &gt; When myself and other courageous black users try and point this out, we are called “sensitive” or “snowflakes” (especially from those with particular team flairs) or similar things, or get accused of race baiting and are told that the disparagement of black figures is based only on merit. That is not true  How do you know these fellow users are black? Cause race is usually pretty unknown on this site.    ----  **Closing Remark:**  &gt;and I want this sub as a whole to acknowledge the bias that’s been going on so we can try and do better as a community on here. Let’s do better.  It's hard to acknowledge the bias going on when you're not really giving any concrete examples. It's also a bit difficult to imagine that this sub that celebrates black coaches and enjoys a predominantly black league of players is racist.   I think most people on this sub are more than happy to reduce racism, but we all have to understand the standard here. You're not making that clear, and instead just using vague comments and accusations without underlying examples or proof, and it's hard to ""do better"" when we have nothing to go off of."
"Yeah, they tried to make that on a ""who has had the best career"" and cut off people with short careers because of that. Using the data I collected last year, the current VORP leaders that are active players (this may be a bit off as it's last years data) is:  * Lebron James * HUGE DROPOFF * Chris Paul * Dirk Nowitzki * Dwyane Wade * Vince Carter * Pau Gasol * Russell Westbrook * Kevin Durant * Manu Ginobili * Andre Iguodala * Stephen Curry  So Manu is probably one of the bigger steals of the century.  edit: overperforming starting 5:  * SG - Manu (VORP as of 2017: 46.8, pick 57) - 1999 - 30th overall in VORP/Game * PF - Paul Millsap (VORP as of 2017:33.5, pick 47) - 2006 - 47th overall in VORP/Game * PG - Kyle Lowry (VORP as of 2017: 31.5, pick 24) - 2006 - 37th overall in VORP/Game  * SF - Kawhi Leonard (VORP as of 2017: 25.6, pick 15) - 2011 - 13th overall in VORP/Game * C - Marc Gasol (VORP as of 2017: 31.2, pick 48) - 2007 - 23rd overall in VORP/Game  This being said Nikola Jokic should probably be there at C instead (VORP as of 2018: 13.7, pick 41) - 2014 - 17th overall in VORP/Game (2017) or maybe even Rudy Gobert (VORP as of 2018: 15, pick 27) - 2013 - 34th overall in VORP/Game (2017)  edit 2: definitely a case for jimmy G buckets as well (VORP as of 2018: 23, pick 30) - 2011 - 25th overall in VORP/Game"
"LeBron James, TOR, and MIL, in that order. Particularly NOT a fan of Boston or Philly."
"Nets fan here:  #East  **Cavs**- LeBron James is my lord and savior. I want him to go god mode. Jesus and Allah himself pray to LeBron  **Sixers**- I trust the Process. I am one with the Process. I hate Philly. Fans...but I love me some Embiid. Also, I hope to have a rivalry with the 76ers some time in the future.  #West  **OKC**- I want Russ to destroy KD doo bad  **Spurs**- I love how the Spurs got no one beaides Aldridge and they still compete. Pop is GOAT coach  **Rockets**- Fuck KD. Fuck the Warriors"
I've had this weird craving for a James Harden John Wall playoff series. I could dig Celtics Rockets if Kyrie wasn't hurt. Westbrook/PG rematching LeBron could be fun. Sixers/Warriors
"“LeBron James, with NO regard for human life!”"
"He's among league leading scorers every season. If he decided to pass up open layups and jumpers in favor of assists like Rondo does all the time then his numbers would reflect his skill. Technically, LeBron puts more velocity on his passes than anyone in the league. He can hum the ball across the court one handed with ease. He also anticipates action better than anyone else, often times throwing the ball before a play develops and his own teammate is aware it's arriving where they will be. If we extend this to playmaking, no one you listed *creates* assist opportunities better than James, who is almost always drawing an extra defender while the likes of Rondo is often waiting for an opening to materialize and deliver them the ball."

&gt;Celtics - LeBron James - 35  *eye twitch*
"So like....Lebron James? Lebron was never put as a PG on paper, but he's essentially a point guard. "
"yeah, wish we were all as smart as you. you're even smarter than all the nba players bro!   &gt; Sports Illustrated asked 190 NBA players who they would want to take a last second shot and Bryant won in a landslide, taking 76% of the votes. Chauncey Billups, LeBron James and Paul Pierce received 3% each, while Dwyane Wade got 2%."
But would a Lebron post up be better than a James Harden iso/PnR
"it's LeBron James, he's the best player on the planet. If you have him, you adapt to him, not the other way around. "
"LMAO your jock strap riding love affair for Lebron is so evident.. with a username like that I can't imagine you being any older than 13, a grown man would usually let go over their childish obsession of a man they don't know, must be some coping mechanism for your pathetic life.  And I'm pretty sure Jordan will always be remembered.. the man who single handedly revolutionized the popularity of the NBA.. the one who sells their shoes and makes millions off of it.. the guy who influenced your boyfriend.. yeah *that* 23 will always be remembered.  And the 90s were trash? lol again, your age is showing. Clearly you do not watch any basketball. James would get crushed in that era."
LeBron James Harden
No. Have you seen what LeBron James is doing? Harden might be MVP but LBJ deserves runner-up
"Said player has to be elite at ISO to take advantage of the 1on1 from all that floor spacing. Said player also has to be able to quickly dump that ball to Capela when the rim protector helps on his drive. Said player also has to be able make those cross court passes when the 3 point defenders collapse even a little bit.  The one guy who fits that criteria was born to one Gloria James, in the city of Akron. That said, I don't know that 'Bron makes them better, as he won't get to the line as much. What makes Houston special is the fact that they put you in a situation where you either have to help (in those situations I outlined in the first paragraph) or let Harden play 1on1. If you let Harden play 1on1, he'd probably put up 50. LeBron can do that but he simply won't do it as often. Lebron still hasn't taken more than 36 shots in a game (Kobe and MJ each have games where they took 49 shots), he just doesn't keep shooting. Harden doesn't have to shoot a lot, as he will get to the over 15 times if he get's to play 1on1 all game."
"If the floor is spread out well enough LeBron is scoring almost every possession, he cant be stopped by any individual defender while going to the rim. Plus, a CP3/LeBron p&amp;r might be better than Steph/KD. It’s close but they’re the two best passers in the league, can kill opponents on mismatches, and imagine LeBron passing to CP3 on a pick and pop, or skip passing to any of the rockets elite shooters. Or Paul giving it to a rolling LeBron James with three elite shooters spacing the floor"
"&gt;important attribute.  LOL yeh, and you know what's an even more important and extremely rare unheard-of attribute? Single handedly destroying any kind of deficit and bringing his team back into the game by dominating in every area of basketball while being super efficient as well, like it's nothing.   &gt;    But Bron will do ALL THAT but miss one or two free throws in the end, and these trash ass Skip Bayless followers will forget everything he did before to even bring his team to that certain position, and only focus on a damn free throw.    &gt;  **FYI**, If LeBron James was shooting 80-90% from the line, he'd literally be the only player in basketball history to have ZERO weakness in any area of the game. IDK if you realize this or not, but that would be extremely fucking unfair, even more so than now.. Just saying"
"Y'all might kill me but I don't think LeBron could replicate Hardens role. The system would have to change, and there's no guarantee that itd be better, although it likely will. For instance James is a much better isolation player."
"That’s a great point, I guess role model is the wrong word. Does Harden have talent and play the game extremely well? Yeah I won’t disagree with you there. But when he plays (what I consider) dirty, I don’t think he should be rewarded. Like take LeBron James or Anthony Davis or Russel Westbrook (and a few more)- I consider them to have not only talent, but an overall clean and strong game. I suppose by role model I mean someone that truly embodies what the sport is about, that’s what an MVP should be. "
"How is it reactionary? Harden does this every game, and it affects his play because he doesn’t put any effort in successive possessions. That’s not the attitude of an MVP.  As for “best stats in the league”, Harden doesn’t even have the best stats between him and LeBron. LeBron averages more assists, rebounds and blocks; as for scoring, LeBron shoots a higher FG% and 3P%. And he does all these things with a lower Usage Rate than Harden.   So yes, there is a debate, especially if you try to argue Harden has the best stats for MVP.  I would vote for LeBron James, but I will accept that there is an argument to be made both ways. There is definitely a debate, you ought to realise."
"I dunno we gotta go through birth records to find who was literally the next LeBron James, it might even be LeBron James Jnr. considering how young he was when LBJ Jr. was born"
"&gt;Jalen Rose: ""I have never seen lebron james play"""
"How is it? LeBron James is the best individual player right now. Just as KD is the 2nd best. You're not bringing anything else into that discussion except for their own individual skill. And I don't only mean 'If they play 1v1 kd wins'. Say KD and Curry are playing against each other, 5v5, KD would have the much better individual stats, but Curry's team would be better than KD's team due to how he elevates his teammates."
"They have already made rules specifically to deter Harden. That is just a false statement.  Watching guys whose primary strategy is to get to the line is bad basketball. It isn't entertaining, and it is something that's already on their radar.   I mean just look at the big picture. Harden should be revered in NBA circles like Lebron James or Kevin Durant or Steph Curry but he isn't yet. That isn't cultivating a star. It's creating an enigma and it's bad for the league all around."
"""LeBron James is definitely the Performer, dribbling between teammates' legs, and throwing up blind shots, and just generally smiling his way through his career a lot more than Jordan."" lol"
LeBron James will never be the next Jordan and the media narrative doesn't make sense. &lt;-OP in 2004   You always get compared to those that come before you.
"I don't like Harden's flops, I like LeBron James, and if you switched them, HOU with LeBron is better than HOU with Harden.  LeBron is my MVP, don't @ me."
"LeBron James is literally in contention to be the greatest of all time. No shit he’s gonna have better stats at the same age 😂😂. No one is arguing that Simmons is just as good as him, or will be just as good as him. They just have similar impacts on the floor (minus the scoring and shooting). Time will tell how good Ben’s offense will be."
&gt;OKC gets: Lebron james  
Lebron James.

I get that his team was worse, but that also means he got more opportunities for counting stats.  "
"""Lebron James reaches his 18th damn prime and faces his 2 sons in the Eastern Conference Finals for the 13th time in 20 years!!!!

"To be fair, the Cavs won the game love was out for, but yeah that was a huge factor.  The official shouldn't have called it a flagrant when it was James instigating it by stepping over Draymond unnecessarily. They wouldn't have dared if it was a closer series at that point and that was a huge turning point.  I'm not going to go into the refereeing otherwise, because as much as possible I try to ignore that.  It was a weird series, but one that's not as cut and dry as LeBron came back down 3-1 against the 73 win warriors. It was a clash of 2 superteams who both had injury problems and there was a dubious suspension."
McCaw has as much of a chance as becoming the next Iguodala as Wiggins does of becoming the next LeBron James.
"Completely healthy is missing one of your starters? Interesting.  Bogut was their defensive anchor, an excellent post facilitator, and set the best illegal screens. You can't just lose one of the players instrumental to your success and still be considered the better team when the other team is LeBron James and 2 all stars"
"My goodness point number 2 just solved a huge piece of the James Harden puzzle for me thank you.  I could not for the life of me put a finger on why I can’t see him hoisting up a championship trophy, and you made realize it’s most likely because of what he has down to a science, which is the INDIVIDUAL game of basketball. Which yes, will result in more money, endorsements, fame, whatever people want for themselves selfishly, which you can by no means blame him for, but ultimately will be the main thing holding him back from the main point, which is WINNING! Him not getting the same calls in the playoffs are a microcosm of the flaw in “me-ball” vs. “team-ball”. You either have to be Jordan/LeBron/Kuzma-esque caliber in me-ball, or it simply won’t get you to the promise land."
"Kobe's image was still recovering from the rape case and I honestly think that had a lot to do with his lack of votes/support. He got the 2nd most 1st place votes, so you either thought Kobe should've won or you had him nearly out the race.    I wouldn't say ""vasty superior"". I gave LeBron credit for his 31 points but there was a noticeable skill gap at that time. LeBron can put up numbers in his sleep but you could tell he was still raw in a lot of areas. The spurs leaving him wide open at times in the finals the following year for example. Kobe was clearly in his prime while you could tell James was still learning. He definitely deserved to be in the conversation but it came down to best player in the league(Kobe) or best player on the best team(Nash)."
"Googles Lebron James. Listed as 6'8"" and 250 everywhere. OKAY fanboy tween."
"I hate when Lakers fans who don’t know what they are talking about try to sound smart. We have two lottery picks, we just won 44 games with no Pat Bev, Dalino, or Milos. We are literally going to have 2 max salary slots in 2019. Lakers fans base their future on Paul George and Lebron James both which probably aren’t going to come so until they put pen to paper and y’all win more than 35 games I don’t want to hear shit about “future”."
"Uhhh, I started watching the NBA because of lebron James. Still a sixers fan "
"They're different players, so you'll obviously see some differences, but they also have enough similarities for the comparison to hold up. Plus there's more than enough to derail your argument.   For starters, you're comparing Lebron's 3rd year to Simmons' rookie season. Plus this Sixers squad is a much better team than what James began with. Lebron developed with a team on his back while Simmons is carrying a lesser load.   Like Harden going from 17/4/4 to 26/6/5 when going from OKC's 3rd option to Houston's 1st option or Kawhi making small but consistent leaps every year playing with the big 3. There's less work on better teams. So maybe Simmons just hasn't had the chance yet. Either way, you gotta wait more than one season to say what he will or won't be. "
"Lebron James, Draymond Green and PG-13."
"Are we still doing this?  Seriously?  Let's look at actual number of games played, Lebron James missed practically all of January."
"Yes, it's okay cause it's a fan's opinion. When KD or if Simmons said it, people would cause a fit because both players would be full of themselves. No one in the league can do what Lebron James does during the Finals. "
This game had nothing to do with LeBron James.
"If Harden wins the MVP award over Lebron James, it will be the biggest travesty in NBA history. How can we give this choker such an award."
next month: Lebron James would be my #1 pick if I had to choose between him and Jordan.
Of course it doesn't make sense. You can't just be the next Lebron James cause it's Lebron James lol
"Haha his undeserved ring. He dad dicked a 73 win team into submission. The refs didn’t hand them three straight games, and certainly didn’t hand them game 7 at Oracle. No, that was Lebron fucking James letting the Warriors know they better go get Durant if they want to beat him. Would have won in 14/15 too if Love and Kyrie weren’t out. Pretty embarrassing the Warriors let that roster win 2 games considering Delly was the second best player on the court for the Cavs that year. That all being said, the Warriors deserved both of those titles, because guess what, they won and nothing else fucking matters. Except in your world, where something is only legit if it fits your narrative. "
"Ah yes, the James Harden narrative. He deserves an MVP. He tricks and cheats the referees much better than LeBron ever could.  The huge disparity in free throws? There has to be an explanation. He can't possibly fake and act his way to that many free throws per game, does he?  I'm not sure what the referees' game plan is coming into the game but it certainly isn't curtailing moves that make them look like idiots."
Okay I think Seth Curry is better than LeBron James. Just an opinion so I'm not wrong right? ;)
"Jesus christ this post is written by some tweenager in Cleveland lol.  James is like 250 max right now. He's also listed as 6'8"". It's like everything you type is just some yankfest kid scheme to make your god look godly. Keep trying child.  Lebron would peak higher my ass lol. The guy literally had the easiest conference technically out of many superstars. The East was garbage for YEARS, some would say almost a decade besides the top two or three teams. He never even played in the best conference in his career, something Jordan actually did.  And then you change the goalposts again to suit your illogical argument. OMG average times in the hundred or the 800m are a little bit faster OMG these guys would completely destroy the earth and make everyone else look like garbage OMG because I said so guyz!  A fuckton guyz! A FUCKTON. Did you hear that! That's how I measure arbitrary differences in decades I never was even born in against the 2000s and up. LOL Lebron had handles no big man.... ahhhh haha. Wilt Chamberlin would literally kick the shit out of Lebron with one leg. I wasn't even around then or close to it, but you are clearly not the sharpest tool and one hilarious poster to boot. And super serious too, which makes it even more embarrassing.  Also, don't try to make this an old man post. I am not an old man, and there are players that because of much better conditioning they do run a bit faster. Some of them are stronger. But that has nothing to do with anything. Averages mean nothing in the NBA. Stronger players are not always good players. There is no correlation between stronger and faster and better. Dwight Howard puts that argument to rest.  Again, have fun because this is my last post to you. This conversation is worthless."
"If scientists wanted to create a perfect basketball player in a laboratory, the player they created would very closely resemble Lebron James. That being said, if those same scientists were picking players at the playground, they would probably pick Michael Jordan first. "
"Favorite part of this clip is the commentators talking about Sixers trying to make a statement ""against that man, LeBron James"" ...and he makes a statement dunk immediately after."
"Yes, no doubt. As is Lebron. I didn’t say Jordan was only great at midrange shooting, just that this and free throw are where his advantage is over Lebron James...who is also one of the greatest offensive players in history."
LeBron James Jr. getting a chase down block on LeBron James Sr. 
"It's odd too because while this is a smart play, it's not exactly revolutionary or interesting in the way that some of the more elaborate breakdowns that get posted on here are. Like in the context of that article with tons of analysis, it makes sense to include plenty of examples like this, because it helps highlight James' BBIQ.   But it's not like this is some sort of crazy mental chessmatch being waged between Brad and LeBron... this is a supper common action in the modern NBA. Teams are constantly running high PnR action to generate mismatches, and the best defenses are naturally going to communicate and look for opportunities to switch intelligently.  Again not trying to say this isn't impressive -- the speed at which LeBron makes these reads and anticipates what the offense is looking to do is a big part of why he's one of the greatest ever. But it's sorta a bummer that someone wrote up a huge article with lots of detail and examples and it probably didn't get that much exposure, and someone lifts a 15 sec clip from it with a nice title and it goes straight to the top..."

"That's too far, but he's Lebron James. They take his feelings into account. I don't see why it has to be just LBJ or the front office directing things. "
"If he wins the title this year especially against the Warriors, we can put him back in the GOAT discussion but otherwise he's ""just"" LeBron James which is pretty great!  3-8 doesn't matter unless you're comparing him to Jordan."
LeBron and only LeBron. No one else is close really. At least one James will be taking that award.
If LeBron should be compared to anyone it's Magic Johnson. They're physical build and style of play is closer to each other than Jordan and James.

"Ok first of all you're the one who stated ""major players"" in your comment. Dwight Howard, Al Horford, Kyrie Irving, and Gordon Hayward are by most measures considered to be major players. Let's not shift the goalposts of this argument as it conveniences you. All of the players I listed either left the West to join an East team or left from an East team to go to another East team. I disproved your earlier statement.  Your entire argument is based around the fact that all superstars have an inherent desire to leave their original home team to join another team for an easy path to victory. Not all players are weak-minded like Lebron James. And many of the superstars we talk about today are comfortable in their respective situations. It's a long process to leave a current team to join a new one, and most of the time the far fetched prospect of ""an easy playoffs"" isn't worth leaving an entire lifestyle and team behind.  &gt;never said East wasn't easier than the West  Then what are you even arguing for now?

What? It's not like KD could play for them in the next round...you act like he was scared so he made the call. The earliest KD could beat lebron wouldn't be for another year...Draymond ended up playing exceptionally well and put up 32 in a game 7. You're reaching.  He wanted KD with him because KD is a top 5 player why does there need to be another reason? Are the sixers not confident in beating Lebron so they're going to make a FA pitch to him? Or do the sixers think they'd be better with James than without.  Draymond had been talking to KD all year even before the series. So Draymond was planning a year+ ahead of time because he didn't have confidence? They won 72 games and had an MVP...if anything those last 3 games show how confident in their jumpshots they were
"[Pippen: ""The way Lebron James plays, Michael Jordan was never asked to play that way, because I took that away from him... he played the game as complete as Lebron James did when he needed to, but he was asked to score the basketball, and thats what he was great at...""](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8afg3d/pippen_the_way_lebron_james_plays_michael_jordan/)"
I guess we will see!   But I’ve learned to never count a team out that has LeBron James on its roster. 
"LeBron ""Literally Adamantium back"" James "
"So Gordon Hayward(Utah to Boston) just doesn't exist I guess, same with Dwight Howard(Houston to ATL), Kyle Lowry(Houston to Toronto).   Not to mention the other stars who went from Eastern teams to other Eastern teams: Kyrie Irving(CLE to Boston), Wade(Miami to Chicago), Al Horford(ATL to Boston).   And before you say that PG13, Butler, and Melo left the East ""because MUH LeGOAT scared them off"", they all had their own reasons for leaving and it had to do with their FOs, not a distant player on another team. Players make their career decisions based on themselves and their interests, not based on what Lebron James does. Please stop being delusional and buying into this bullshit. The West's playoffs are are gladiator bout compared to the carnival that is the East's playoffs.   Nobody in their right mind would want to face Houston, Golden State, San Antonio, and OKC over the Bucks, Raptors, Cavs, or Celtics."
"If I replied to your comment saying something as absurd as ""NBA superstars plan out their own careers based on where Lebron James decides to play"", you too would see that there's no point in arguing further."
"&gt; “Michael Jordan is probably the greatest scorer to play the game, but I may go as far as to say **LeBron James may be the greatest player to ever play the game** because he is so potent offensively that not only can he score at will but he keeps everybody involved.  I can see why Scottie takes issue with what Zeke said.  Oh wait, Zeke didn't say that?  I wonder who did then...  Oh right, Scottie Pippen.  https://newsone.com/1265855/scottie-pippen-lebron-james-michael-jordan-greatest-of-all-time/  Dude is fickle as fuck.  He gave the exact same reasoning Isiah gave.  What's especially silly is that when Pippen said it in 2011, Zeke disagreed with him.  &gt; Thomas, whose Piston teams beat Jordan's Bulls three straight times before finally losing in 1991 as Jordan later claimed his first title, didn't have as firm a stance as Abdul-Jabbar, but wouldn't agree with Pippen's comments either.  &gt;""I think LeBron has a chance to eclipse Jordan if he continues to improve his game, but where they are right now, you still have to take Jordan as being the better player,"" Thomas said Tuesday night on ""The Stephen A. Smith Show"" on ESPN Radio 1050. **""Now, six years from now, if LeBron continues to add different facets to his game, then maybe you can have that argument and you can have that debate.**  Now we're 7 years later."

Why does that matter? If they beat James that's LeBron hopping onto a finals team that bounced him. That's cupcake shit. Honestly how can y'all have this take? And this dude is better than Jordan?
Fuck off I hate this so much LeBron James leave my conference alooooooooooooone
"Skip: ""Classic Lebron James making fun of a rookie even after taking a loss. It's despicable and quite frankly if I was him, I'd never laugh again after what happened in 2011"""
"His defense was elite.  Also his post game was elite.  Ray Allen's post game and defense was nowhere near Kobe's.  Also Kobe's shot selection was as good as he was hot.  If he was on, it didn't matter that he was double teamed lol  If the game was on the line the only shot selection that there needed to be was Kobe shooting from literally anywhere.  I'm not sure why, but people on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair? "
"Wtf, Rachel Nichols first question did not have to be about why Simmons should be ROTY. Man's just put up 27/15/13 against Lebron James and Co.

"Definitely. This would be the 3rd time he'd jump ship and  join a team when he feels it's about to sink. I understand wanting to play with his friends in Miami with a chance to compete for championships. I applaud him for taking control of his own future. What I don't like is the fact that we judge KD(rightfully so) for joining the Warriors and trying to form a juggernaut but that's exactly what LeBron wants and did with the Heat. KD gets more blame for joining a team that he just lost to, which is fair, but in this 76ers scenario, that's exactly what James would be doing. When LeBron returned to Cleveland, he didn't foresee the vast improvement of the Warriors and thought he was forming another superteam with Kyrie and Love. Joining Embiid, Simmons and Fultz AFTER they beat you would fall in the same category."

Because “Lebron James comments on big news of the day” equals clicks. Unfortunately.
"No one thought Oladipo and the bros could match up to Lebron ""I'm East's daddy"" James"
"If Lebron James jumped off a bridge, would you jump too?"
It wasn’t just that they asked. The announcement broke during the game. Lebron didn’t know. Lebron and Pop are close friends from Olympic teams. They broke the news to Lebron that his close friend’s wife died on live tv just so they could own the footage of Lebron James learning his close friend’s wife died on live tv. 
Jerami Grant or Lebron James? Who ya got?
“Lebron James fined for cursing on live tv”
"""LeBron James just dropped 46/12/5 in a key playoff game, and for a reward, we're going to make him react to a friends' personal loss, live in front of millions of people!""  Honestly, how fucking shameless is that. Somebody, other than Pop or LeBron, needs to do their best Pop impression and take TNT out to the woodshed. Ideally the commissioner or something. These people are paid to put on an entertaining basketball game. They have a right to some semblance of a private personal life. This isn't Big Brother."
"Anybody that coaches LeBron James gets put under a microscope, so it's really not fair. I think he can be a good head coach and he needs a second chance."
Maybe someone like LeBron James.  
"Lebron James. Goddamn, that would be fun to watch. "
"Said LeBron James, current NBA Star, while hugging himself before hitting the locker room. "
"Former NBA star LeBron James hugged LeBron James and said, ""Le'All look so different."""
"Bruh. You’re a cavs fan. My man. Lebron freaking James, no matter what age or injury, people would pay him solely to have him on the coaching staff alone. He’s a great leader, and an amazing player. One of the best basketball minds of our era. You don’t trade him. Him having a NTC is a security blanket for him, its like having a model lambo, even if you don’t drive it, you bet your ass you want insurance on it. And besides, there was only one time Kobe was ever considered for trade and that was to see if the cavs would give Lebron Mother fucking James for him."
" While looking in the mirror LeBron yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” The mirror gave a look of pleasant surprise. LeBron yells out once more, “We got a [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the bathroom door, He glanced back one more time and said, “You look so different.”"
"We Need To Talk About JR, starring Lebron James."
Til lebron James is good at basketball. 
"understandable, but it's worrying that at home court, the cavaliers managed to edge one out over 6 points over LeBron's 42 points on 70 FT%. That's unsustainable.  With Oladipo presumably not getting into foul trouble anymore, Pacers moving to their homecourt, and depending on the severity of Love's injury, this *might* actually be a first round exit for the Cavaliers.  But, you know, LeBron James exists so nothing is set in stone yet"
I don’t even like LeBron but can these assclowns  not ambush James like that on live TV for a dramatic reaction.  WTF?
“A very emotional moment for Lebron James right there”    Like what the fuck? Why not ask him about the FORTY SIX POINT GAME HE JUST PUT UP? Jesus fucking Christ man

LeBron James. 
LeBron James
"Lebron walks into a dark room. The television is on. It’s Sportscenter. The headline on the screen reads, “Pacers-Cavs game 2 may be the biggest game in Cavs history.”  Lebron shakes his head and turns the television off. He sits on a one person couch and looks up. It’s a painting of Lebron and Kyrie hugging after the 2016 Finals but Kyrie’s head is replaced by Dwyane Wade’s.  “Mr. James, I’m here with your wine.”   Maverick Carter walks in with a glass of wine on a gold plate.   Lebron sticks his hand out and takes the glass without turning around.   “Thank you, Maverick.”  “Mr. James, your wife and kids want to see you.”  Lebron’s face grows with anger.  “They know it’s Zero Dark 30-23...”  “I know, Mr. James. That’s what I told them. Just figured you should know.”  Lebron shakes his head. “Just wait outside, Maverick.”  Maverick Carter walks out.   Lebron takes a whiff, takes a quick sip, and swishes the wine around in his mouth before swallowing like a true wine connoisseur.  “Vino powers I know you hear me. I know I’ve exhausted nearly all the extra powers you’ve allotted for the season, but I just need a little more to carry these bums to the championship.”  Lebron sits in silence for a moment. He goes to his phone and opens up his music app. He chooses something.   “I’m nick wright and coming up, I will tell you all why Lebron James is both Steph Curry’s literal AND figurative father.”  Lebron sits back, closes his eyes, and casually sips his glass of wine."

come on man it's lebron james with a realistic chance of going down 0-2 at home.  what do you expect? 
"I don't know how many years you watching the NBA, but believe me that no chance that Denver could win the NBA title without the superstars on their roster.  In 2-3 years, Warriors will still be the best (if they can keep the core), although Philadelphia and Wolves (and probably Rockets) will be amongst the top teams in the league, with LeBron James' team.  I know that you appreciate Jokic (and maybe you are from Serbia, too), but Jokic is not a good defensive player, and he needs to develop more every year if he wants to become one of the best centers in the league.  Btw... Will Barton will go this summer.  "
"Why is it whenever someone critiques something about the game, not necessarily even related to LeBron, the immediate response is ""Lol look at all these LeBron haters"". Bad reffing has literally nothing to do with LeBron James, why insert him in every critique towards the Cavs? "
that's not a flagrant on anyone but Lebron James.
I am impartial being a sonics fan (RIP) and it is quite obvious that some people do not like Lebron James because he is Lebron James.  He honestly seems to get less calls than anyone else.  Serious.
"The refs aren't out there making fadeaways, that's lebron james. "
LEBRON JAMES! 🐐🐐🐐  Edit: All you downvoters just enjoy watching the greatest basketball player of your lifetime while you can 
It's LeBron James
"Lebron ""James Harden"" James"
LeBron James! Stephen Curry! 
"&gt;there's no way he would do PEDs  Lol what the hell are you talking about? Literally every major competitive sport, even ones where there aren't millions on the line like distance running, are riddled with PEDs.   These NBA athletes have so much at stake with million dollar contracts on the line - or in LeBron's case [billions](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/05/17/lebron-james-nike-deal-contract-one-billion). LeBron cares so much about his body and the NBA is the laxest of the major sports about drug testing; it's almost naive to assume that LeBron isn't using *some* sort of performance enhancing drug. "
What if this is the last home game for LeBron James as a Cleveland Cavalier?
Ty Lue needs to not have Calderon out there with James. Put in one more shooter. Calderon needs to be out there with the second squad because nobody besides him and Lebron can get the offense set properly.
"pacers are still keeping it close even though Lebron ""Bitch I Look Like Goku"" James showed up, so that's nice"
LeBron ppg and fga are high due to him having to do more to help the team.  James Harden passes more now due to the system he is in now. That's what his coach is asking from him. He was basically the PG before CP3 joined him. LeBron has been doing it his whole career
I'm not surprised fans of a LeBron James team are complaining about a call involving verticality.
"I like how every year we speculate about why the cavs are actually weak now and forget that at the end of the day, he's still LeBron fucking James "
"If arm extensions were called as push offs LeBron James would foul out in the first quarter every game, including this one."
This LeBron James guy can score easily on the Pacers.
"LeBron James yelled, “There you go!” LeBron James gave a look of pleasant surprise. LeBron James belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, current NBA star LeBron James hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Any team that has Lebron James on it is going to get hate naturally. 
"“FLOPPING Lebron James can’t win games without the help of the refs! He has no integrity, unlike my spurs.”"
"imo it wasn't a hate the Cavs as much as ""I hate they have fucking Lebron James""  But this is referring to the actual interactions between their fans. Between Pacers fans crying (pun intended) foul about how the reffing is skewed, and Cavs fans presumably salty about the beatdown Sunday and how everyone wants them to lose, it's a dangerous mix"
"LeBron James: ""LeBonjour"""
"""LeBron James doesn't have the clutch gene. The chosen one will turn into the frozen one in game 2 and will hand his throne over to one Victor Oladipo"" - Skeeeup probably."
"The cavs aren't a good team, but they have LeBron James. And that's enough to beat just about anyone any time. But putting up 60 points a night is going to kill him physically, and even the king can't do that every night. Bad news for the cavs really. "
I honestly don't know why some goofballs on this sub were acting like it was over after game 1. End of the day he's still LeBron fucking James 
ESPN: IS LEBRON JAMES A PETTY PERSON AND A SELFISH FRIEND?
"For a team that was literally outscored by LeBron James in the first quarter, being down 12 at the half isn't too bad for Indy. Just got to keep Oladipo on the court this half (hopefully he's fresh from playing relatively little in the first half). "
"Dipo getting that ""we the NBA cannot allow LeBron James to lose this game at any cost"" treatment"

Fuck a team I'm Lebron James baby
"Did you see the comments for the last game? People were shitting on him while he had a triple double.Anyone else and they can't their cocks deep enough down their throat. Lebron? ""oh and people are gonna act like this loss isn't lebrons fault""..When he passes too much..It's lebrons fault. If he scores more and doesn't pass. It's lebron's fault. James could score 60/20/20 and people would say ""oh he's just showing off""."
This is why the Cavs are still the favourites to come out of the East until proven otherwise. Lebron James.

Lebron James
"1. I seriously doubt any one knows anything at all about where Lebron James is going next year. 2. Lebron on a team of up and coming young studs is counter to The Process so the league should forbid them getting a big time veteran FA.  EDIT: Come on guys, I shouldn't have to point out that I'm playing around when I put ""the league should forbid them from getting a bit time veteran FA"".  "
"He would have. He would have, and he would have hit it, and they would have won.   He's Lebron James."
"Lebron James admittedly phoned in an entire month during the regular season. Name one MVP, that clearly deserved the award, after doing something similar.  Lebron James had an amazing season, but the award will mean nothing if you give t to someone that literally gave up at one point."
"You know who else didn't go to college? Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Tracy mcgrady, they went straight from high school to the NBA"
"Erik Spoelstra was along for the Lebron James ride. Pop had nearly 2 decades of dominance, I wouldn’t be shocked if Spo never saw another conference finals."
"Personally I think it's pretty silly to compare across sports.  But I have a hard time not believing it's a Quarterback.  You can win titles without Lebron James, in a wide variety of ways.  You simply cannot win a title in the NFL without stellar QB play.  No position carries as much weight in all of sports as the QB.  "
https://hashsports.com/why-lebron-james-isnt-just-the-nbas-most-valuable-player-but-the-most-valuable-player-in-sports/
"&gt;actually get touches and shots up  Are we watching the same LeBron James? Sure, Boston has one of the best offensive systems in the NBA, and Brad is absolutely Top 2 or 3 in the league right now, but Bron gets his guys involved too. "
"For those trying to say ""only 25 times"", I did some math.  2,491 games since Dominique first did it in 1986 until LeBron James did it last night. This includes all the games played on the day Dominique and James went at least 15 shots without a miss at the free throw line.  In those 2,491 games, we can assume at least 10 players with the heaviest load of minutes (either being the 10 starters, or a 6th man who players ""starter type minutes"").  So, that would be 24,910 players with ""starter minutes"" in those 2,491 games.  Since this has only happened 25 times, that would be .1% of those 24,910 players.  So, in the 2,491 games, this has only happened in 1% of those games, and out of an estimated 24,910 players, only .1% have accomplished this."
"I'm about as big a LeBron fan as you can find, and I'd still say Westbrook.  You just have to watch the two games.  They both carried their teams, but Westbrook was a force of nature.  With Gobert out, the dude just was electrifying.  If Bill Simmons described LeBron accurately as a serial killer coldly dismembering bodies and stuffing them in the fridge with a blank look on his face, then Westbrook went Jesse James on their asses."
"&gt;He literally blocked it like a split second after it hit the glass.  http://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-block-victor-oladipo-goaltend-2018-4  Not the best video angle, but you can see Oladipo trying to lay up with his right hand from the left backboard, then look closely at the ball's projectory before LeBron touches it and draw your own conclusions.  The pic at the top of the page even shows how far away from the rim it was.    In any case, it was technically a missed goaltend that I saw as a makeup call for the ball earlier getting slapped out of LeBron's hand out of bounds that Cleveland should've kept.  &gt;At full speed there’s no way anyone can claim they know it for sure wasn’t going to have a chance.  I agree, and also it wasn't clear that it was a goaltend until you see the replay as well.  "
Which is ironic because he's now obsessed with Ben Simmons even more than LeBron James
"So what? This is a case of stats being misapplied. You would need stats on Lebron James buzzer beater 3's going to his left, to make an apt comparison on your first stat. For all we know it includes 2's and shots at the rim.     And on the second one, there's no reason that the teammates shot has to be an open 3. Lue might not be the greatest coach, but it doesn't take a genius to tell your players that if your man goes to double you cut to the open space. "
Lebron James clutch goaltending on Oladipo!
"&gt; Here's a thought experiment: LeBron James and James Harden switch teams. How well would those teams do?  Rockets would have gone 70-12, Cavs would have gone 40-42. LeBron is so clearly more valuable than Harden, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills every time someone says ""Obviously I understand why Harden's the MVP this year"". It sounds to me like ""Obviously I understand that yellow plus blue makes orange"""
"hey man, i understand how you feel. Before we had lebron james, all we had was a culture of losing. My dad took me to the 1995 world series. He cried that night."
We are all LeBron James on this blessed day?
"No. Tell me how many LeBron James' there are in the world? How many KD, Curry, Harden, Westbrooks there are?  Now granted, in terms of NBA money some are overpaid (I'm looking at you Evan Turner). "
"I still think that the Cavs make it to the finals, but to me it is more in doubt than it has been since they were down 3-2 to Boston in  2012. From 2013 to 2017 I never had any serious doubts as to a LeBron led teams ability to get through the East. But this year looks like the year he could finally not make it.   Granted I think the Pacers are a bad matchup for them and I think they haven't gotten good shooting on open three point shots for the most part from non-Kyle Korver players (those shots will have a period of time when guys like JR, Hood, and Clarkson among others hit.) But still the Cavs just look like the pre-Heat LeBron Cavs where it is just LeBron James and 4 other guys.  "
"LeBron ""Nap Lajoie"" James"
Lebron. James.
"I mean, Oladipo put LeBron on skates and actually got it on the glass before James could close the gap and block it. It was actually an uncalled goaltend. I think this was clearly the right play, but the refs missed a very difficult call without review."

So the past only counts when we're talking about the Pacers vs. Lebron James in the past 10 years? Is there a statute of limitations that I'm not aware of when it comes to lamenting sports failures?   I'm just saying we've been there too. Just because it was a little longer ago doesn't make it less real. 
Cavs ran a 1-dimensional offense that got shut down by prime Dwight Howard. Honerable mention to Rashard Lewis and Hedo Turkoglu who were also tall enough to bother the drives.  Also helps that magic team was leading the league in HGH. The magic starting 5 were all on HGH and on the Cavs only Lebron was. Hedo and  Rashard were both caught using roids. Rumors/speculation link Jameer Nelson along with Lebron James to a certain Miami clinic. Dwight was never caught AFAIK but it was just obvious from his comic book shoulders.
hey this lebron james guy is pretty good
Man only people outside Cleveland call Kevin an all star. He is 100% reliant on Lebron James. His post up game sucks and he only does good if Leborn drives and kicks and Love makes it. He CANNOT create his own game.

Well unless you’re LeBron James jk
LeBron James is a good basketball player. 
I am a Cavs fan dating back to the late 80's-early 90's.   Replace Lebron James with Michael Jordan and I could have written this 25 years ago. 
"I disagree. Lebron James may as well be the better basketball player, I don't dispute that.  But if you have ever lived in a country where Michael Jordan is the only reason people even care about basketball, you wouldnt say even compare Lebron's off the court accomplishments to his. Jordan brought basketball, shoes, and this mythos of being the greatest in the world across the world and people who had never heard of the sport in their lives tuned in to watch that. Even today, look at all the Bulls gear around Asia. I dont think anyone has a chance to be the next Jordan because there isnt room for anyone to do what Jordan did for basktball. That's why he will always be the GOAT for me.  But I won't deny that Lebron may be the better player in a vacuum. "
Well Lebron passed Michael Jordan in playoff game winners overall and tied him in playoff buzzer beaters in 2015: https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/5/11/8584749/lebron-james-michael-jordan-game-winning-shots  Add tonight's buzzer beater and he's two game winners ahead of Jordan and one buzzer beater ahead of Jordan.  
"I'd agree with you... but Lebron James. You can only bet against the man so many times before you start saying 'fuck it, maybe'.  If there was a man that could do it, it would be him. And if he does it, he solidifies his GOAT argument."
"It's nuts, his early career was riddled with LEBRON PASSES TOO MUCH HE DOESN'T HAVE KILLER INSTINCT hot takes. Can't even remember which year it was but one year he caught a ton of flack for passing to donyell Marshall for a wide open corner three to win the game instead of going 1 v 5  Edit : here it is http://www.espn.com/nba/dailydime?page=dailydime-070522  &gt; Marshall couldn't have been any more wide open on the 3-point attempt from the right corner with 5.9 seconds left, so you can hardly fault James for getting him the ball. Right?  &gt; Well, maybe you can.  &gt; Because at the moment James threw that pass, he was driving to his left and seemed like he might have been able to get around Tayshaun Prince and power to the basket, although Richard Hamilton was closing hard from one side and Rasheed Wallace was coming in from the other.  Just insane.   "
"No, and I say this as a person whose favourite player of all time is LeBron.   We cannot simply evaluate a player but absolute wins added. The purpose of the league is to win championships, or in the regular season, win as many games as possible. Each player adds a certain amount of wins to his team based on how he and the rest of his team played during the season.  Even if you take LeBron himself. If he were to join the worst team in the league, he takes them to the playoffs by himself. Phoenix would go from winning 21 games to 45 or so just by adding LeBron. Now if you gradually improve the team he is added to, the amount of wins he will add will be diminishing in return, even if his level of play (not necessarily the volume, just overall excellence) remains the same. Like, the Rockets with LeBron may only add like 5 or so wins to the overall total. He is still playing at the same ability, but there's only so much you can improve a team that is already so good.   This is not just limited to LeBron. Generally, it is exponentially harder for a team to improve a team, the better the team is.  So why should we reward less wins added to a good team over more wins added to a worse team? After all, LeBron may have taken an otherwise 25 win team to 50 wins this year, while Harden may have ""only"" added 15 wins to a Rockets team that many have won 50 without him. As I said, the purpose of league is to win as many games as possible. The purpose of a superstar is to lead his team to elite status.  Without getting into a deep statistical analysis, it's suffice to say that both LeBron and Harden put up similarly elite numbers. However, Harden is doing so on an elite team. With most players, you will find that the better the team, the lower your production will be. One, it is because the usage will be shared and two, it is because after a certain level of talent advantage, your team will start blowing out all their opponents and there will be more garbage time. Bosh in Toronto vs Miami, Kobe in seasons where he was surrounded by scrubs vs seasons where he had a contending level of supporting cast, KAT on 31 team last year vs how he did on a playoff team this year. Happens to everyone.   In 2015-16, imagine if there were two identical Steph Currys, who were equally good. The GSW Curry put up 30-5-7 on insane efficiency in 34 mpg on a 73-9 team. The alternate Curry, on say the Nets, would not average those numbers. He would have had a bigger load, have less good players to share usage with, less blowouts so more minutes. He might have put up 35-6-9 and lead the Nets to 50 wins, the way he was playing. But would the Nets Curry be a better player? No because, they are identical. Nets Curry just puts up more impressive numbers because of circumstances around his team. This is why, when two players put up a similarly impressive numbers, the one doing so on a better team is more impressive. Doing it on a better team is harder as production opportunities are less.   The purpose of any player is not to put up big numbers and carry the burden on an otherwise mediocre team. The purpose of any player is help his team win as much as possible. Adding wins and putting up stats to a better team is harder but that is what a player should be judged by. Not their ability to stand out on a crappy team but to be the most outstanding contributor to one of the elite teams. MVP award is that incentive, imo.   This is why, I would go with James Harden over my favourite player this year and I would have gone with him over Westbrook last year. I have mostly agreed with the MVP selections in the past otherwise.   Note: All the estimated numbers are pulled out of my ass and you may disagree with the exactness. "

"I agree entirely. Harden's team is literally built for him. Great perimeter defenders who can also shoot 3s, one of the best pick-and-roll centers in the league, and another elite ball-handler and distributor who allows Harden to be effective off the ball. I think Harden is a fantastic player, but I think a couple other players could play his role in Houston.  Here's a thought experiment: LeBron James and James Harden switch teams. How well would those teams do?"
Carmelo Anthony father of Lebron James confirmed
"I enjoy watching the Lebron James. They are my favorite NBA team. When they score, I think to myself ""yes."" When the other team scores, I think to myself ""no""."
This Cavs team needs to grow the fuck up and fast. They are laughably bad when Lebron doesn't play. I saw a stat after game 4 that said the next highest total assists to Lebron's ridiculous number was Jeff Green with 9. 9 assists over 4 games. It's horrendous basketball on the offensive end but their defensive hustle (not sarcasm) has been their saving grace along side the obvious Lebron James.

"Lebron James on the 76ers. People touting it like it's a brilliant move, but I think the play-styles of Lebron and Ben will end up clashing quite a bit"
"i kinda like the whole Lebron vs the world thing. too bad it's not gonna get them anywhere. Lebron is more valuable to this team than James Harden is to his team. I understand why Harden will win MVP for this season, but the truth is there is no bigger MVP than Lebron. He gets overlooked every season now because he consistently puts up the same points. If other players put up Lebron's stats they likely win MVP.   edit: perfect example is when harden went 2-18 they still won by 20. if lebron goes 2-18 they lose by 30."
You must be new to this whole LeBron James business
This LeBron James team looks explosive. 
"Cavs forward Lebron James yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Lebron James gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Lebron James yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Lebron James traveling back in time via Instagram hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Lebron has made a total of 1500 FT in his playoff career.  Shaquil still has the most FTA, by 300.  James is already 500 points ahead of Jabbar but Jabbar has made about 130 field goals more. And 300 points ahead of Jordan. (playoff totals)  If this keeps up Lebron will likely surpass Jabbar's playoff+RS points within 3 seasons."
"Makes me think, when those haters and trolls on Lebron James become old people, like with basketball understanding grandkids, and asked by those kids, ""How was Lebron James like during your time? How'd you experienced his greatness?""     Curious what would they say."

"Gotta be the pressure. Oladipo went off for 32 in game one and he’s a tremendous talent. However, he’s not at a caliber level with LeBron and the rest of the league’s current greats.

"The game is said and done but it's funny how many people don't know the rules.

"Well, on a basic level, the league on average was [older](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats.html) when it was ""much worse"" due to the supposed flood of high school players.  And more importantly, players drafted out of high school between 1995-2005 have actually outperformed expectations relative to where they were drafted.  We remember the busts due to the narrative the media pushed about all these young guys that weren't ready.  Just like there was all the downplaying of international guys as a backlash to the Tskitishvilis (spelling, lol) of the world.  Going off [this page's](https://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/index616a.html?p=2740) research which I chose after doing some light googling we can look.  Of the 39 guys drafted out of high school between 1995-2005 more outperformed draft expectations than not.  Let's delve into this in detail, cause I'm in the mood.  #Top 3  Here we see some notable examples on both sides of the discussion.  You have LeBron James (1st overall), Dwight Howard (1)and Tyson Chandler (2).  You also have Kwame Brown (1) and Darius Miles (3).  I think it's pretty clear where they all end up.  The first 3 outpaced their draft-position-contemporaries, while the other two didn't.  *Hit rate: 3/5 (60%)*  #Rest of lottery (4-14)  This is a noisy group.  There are 12 players here, and more than half of them had their careers either ended prematurely or severely impacted by injuries.  That's the nature of the beast, however.  So that leaves us with:  5 guys exceeding expectations: Garnett (5th overall), McGrady (9), A. Stoudemire (9), A. Bynum (10), K. Bryant (13)  7 guys underperforming: E. Curry (4), Livingston (4), J. Bender (5), M. Webster (6), Diop (8), R. Swift (12), Telfair (13)  More guys underperformed than didn't, but I don't think that paints a full picture.  The 5 guys who outperformed *destroyed* their expected value.  The only one that even came close to his expected value is Andrew Bynum, who had his career cut short extremely early due to injury.  On the other side of things, the 4 highest drafted players in this group of underperformers had their careers cut short, again, due to injury.  Curry was still likely to flame out, but Livingston was just as likely to end up in the first group.  Webster had a decent shot to finish above the baseline.  Bender is hard to project because he was so young when he first got hurt.  *Hit rate 5/12 (42%) ((lots of caveats, however))*  #Remainder of first round (15-30)  There are 12 guys in this group, let's breeze through.  Exceeded expections: Al Jefferson (15th), J. O'Neal (17), Josh Smith (17), JR Smith (18), Dorrell Wright (19), Al Harrington (25), K. Perkins (27) *7 total*  Underperformed: G. Green (19), T. Outlaw (23), D. Stevenson (23), L. Smith (25), N. Edi (26) *5 total*  So we can see here it's all pretty well distributed.  A few home run picks, a couple complete busts, and a bunch of role players who toe both sides of the line.  *Hit rate 7/12 (58%)*  #First round summary  So it's worth noting that throughout the entire first round the picks shook out to a 51% (15/29) hit rate.  Far from the cavalcade of busts people describe it as.  Definitely not the ""for every 1 Lebron there are 5 Sebastian Telfairs"" as the guy above said.  #Second round  10 guys here.  Exceeded expectations: R. Lewis (32nd), CJ Miles (34), M. Ellis (40), L. Williams (45), Blatche (49), Amir Johnson (56)  Underperformed: R. Sanchez (35), K. Young (40), O. Cisse (46), J. Lang (48),   We see here 6 guys all massively outperforming expectations, and 4 not making it.  Two of the guys who didn't are international guys who attended prep schools briefly in the US before declaring -- far from traditional high school guys.  *Hit rate 6/10 (60%) with two players barely fitting into criteria*  #Overall findings (TLDR)  So we can see, 21 (54%) of the 39 high school guys drafted between 1995-2005 exceeded expectations of a player picked at their spot.  That means, on average, players drafted out of high school outperform expectations.  If we were to (admittedly, maybe a little unfairly) account for injury that number is closer to 60%.  On top of that, a large portion of the guys who outperformed their draft slot *absolutely fucking murdered* what would be their expected career Win Shares.  The idea that high school players made the league worse is a dumb myth.  Is that enough examples /u/ohchristworld"

"I don't think you can really translate them the way you are trying to.  For example, defensive rebounds are more about who the team decides to give them to than about actual defensive talent.  Look at Westbrook for instance.  Think about all the uncontested defensive boards he gets because the team decides to just give them to him to help him pad his stats.  This isn't to say that Lebron is just stat padding.  In reality, it just makes sense for most of the team to let him pull down the board because he is so good running the offense, especially in transition, compared to other big men.    Or look at the way teams space the floor more now and the line-ups this favors.  By generally moving players towards the 3 point line more and by switching out more traditional big men for guys that are more versatile and can play further away from the rim, you get more of an opportunity for smaller guys to compete for boards.  This isn't a knock on LeBron or anything, but I just can't imagine that he is getting the same number of boards if he is playing in '94 when you had Ewing, Mourning, Shaq, Hakeem, and David Robinson all making the all-star team.  The fact is that when you got that many legit 7 footers who live in the lane, it is stupid to send Lebron in to bang with them all game.    Same thing with guarding 1-4.  While I'm not saying he can't do it, what coach in their right mind is going to put James on the Charles Oakley's of the world?  Sure, he might be able to handle those guys, but it is going to be such a physical grind that it isn't really worth it.   As such, I'm not sure the fact that he *could* do it matters as much.  I think what matters more is what is practical for them to do *and* not have a drop off on the defensive side.  From that standpoint, I'm not sure you are having him guards 4's in Jordan's era at a high enough rate/level to make up for the other areas where Jordan is better.  It is somewhat the same thing when it comes to guarding 1's.  I mean, *can* he guard 1's here and there when the situation demands it?  Sure.  Is he going out there and getting Westbrook or Kyrie or Curry as his primary assignment for the entire game?  I don't think really think so, but I could be wrong.  As before, does the fact that he theoretically *could* guard these guys all game without totally shitting the bed really enough to make up for the other ways that Jordan is better defensively?

Secondly saying the same PPG is a joke. Durant shot 64.7 TS% in a league where the average was 53.4%. KD was +11.3% over expected, which is outrageous. Davis shot a 61.2 TS% this year in a league where the average is 55.5%, +5.7% over expected. While AD's efficiency is very good, it's a joke to compare it to what Durant was doing at the same age. Not to mention KD was the 2nd best player in the world and finished runner up in the MVP to LeBron for the 3rd time. He also led his team to 60 wins and the 1 seed, New Orleans barely made the playoffs.

Lebron isn't James
"Lebron should not go to Philly. It would really mess up Simmons. I get that they're similar players and Simmons could learn a lot from James but with no decent jumper and James being so ball dominant, Simmons will get left out.   LBJ would kill with Embiid though. "
"To become a high level IQ player, such as Kobe, LeBron, Cousy, Maravich, or Bird, you must first understand the nuances of the game. For example, the Spain Pick and Roll is a highly complex tactical set that only the more advanced students of the game (like myself) can understand. I, for one, get most of my high-level basketball knowledge from browsing r /nba. I am actually in the process of developing some [OC] that speaks to the more Machiavellian style (if you will) play of Joe Ingles and how that relates to the 3 pillars of Basketball Knowledge set forth by the Basketball Elders (John Wooden, Hubie Brown, Dr. James Namesmith, and Mark Eaton)"
LeBron James
Im lebron james and good at basketball but don’t have photographic memory.
"&gt; Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James is the first player in NBA Finals history to lead both teams in points, assists and rebounds for the entire series, according to ESPN.  Then said that's not good enough and led both teams in points, reb, assts, steals, and blocks for the 2016 finals."
I am LeBron James except I am not good at basketball. 
"Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!”   Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise.   J.R. Smith belted, “We got a f***ing squad now.”   And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, Dirk Nowitzki hugged him &amp; said, “There's going to be a video of Mark Cuban beside himself. Driving around downtown Dallas begging DeAndre Jordan's family for an address to DeAndre's home. And I'm going to be honest with you, I'm going to need your support during the challenges."""
"By far not the best coach in the league is a pretty bold statement. I'd say that pretty much everyone relevant has him in the top 3-5 at least, and he's a finalist for CotY. Once again you're saying some crazy shit that's nothing but your opinion and insist that it's evidence supporting your narrative.  Brad Stevens is one of the best coaches in the NBA.  The Boston Celtics have a very talented roster.  The Boston Celtics are a young roster that occasionally make rookie errors.  The Boston Celtics are outperforming the expectation of their talent during this postseason.  All four of these things are true, and none of them are contradictory. The Celtics are a talented team, but extremely young and prone to rookie issues, they have an extremely talented coach who has helped to smooth over this rough transition period and as a result of all of these factors together, the Boston Celtics are playing at a level that they should not be at on paper.  The Celtics without Hayward and Irving are talented, but even with both of them healthy they were expected to make a deep layoff run with a ceiling of losing the finals. Once Hayward was injured, they were expected to have a ceiling of losing the ECF. One Kyrie was injured, the ceiling became a second round exit.  Very talented teams of young players don't tend to make ECF runs in their first year together, and they definitely don't tend to threaten LeBron James in the ECF. Boston doing what Boston has done this post season is extremely impressive even when you take the talent of their young players into consideration."
&gt; muh basic reading comprehension  Either that^ or you didn't actually watch basketball that season so I'll spell it out for you.  My argument is the Hawks won the season series fairly dominantly so clearly when comparing basketball teams based on the ACTUAL MATCHUP like any non-(autistic 12 year old) the Hawks were the clear favorite versus the Bulls  *REGARDLESS* of each teams' independent abilities to deal with LeBron James. Which is irrelevant to a Hawks Bulls series since LeBron wouldn't be playing in it.
"Interesting scene in the Celtics locker room. Jaylen was FaceTiming his father, Kyle. He asked to see LeBron James. Someone brought the phone over to LeBron and he said ""good game!"" LeBron responded, ""Not me, that was your dad."""
"Normal brain: ""Brad Stevens is a great coach""  Big brain: ""Brad Stevens deserves most of the credit for the Celtics success""  Bigger brain: ""I'd rather have Brad Stevens than LeBron James""  Galaxy Brain: ""When the Celtics lose, it's just yet another stroke of Brad Stevens genius, he's clearly throwing the games"""
"Lebron James stat pads a lot to absolve himself from any blame when things aren't going the Cavs' way, letting teammates catch the flak."
"""World Fame"" my ass. I bet if I asked 100 random people in my home town ""Do you know who Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, LeBron James are?"" about 95 of them would answer ""No"". NBA basketball is literally non-existent in Germany's media."
Lol what!?? This sub is so pro LeBron James. And they hate Kobe. Where do you see this ?
http://www.insightsquared.com/2013/06/how-lebron-james-embraced-analytics-and-became-a-legend/  He likely has a balance. I remember reading Shane Battier was a big influence on him to use advanced stats and analytics during his Heat tenure.
http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2777308-lebron-james-on-data-saying-hes-slowing-down-the-dumbest-s-t-ive-ever-heard  Worthless stat...
"Defensively the Celtics were also giving the Cavs non-LeBron players too much space from 3. You should be able to live with guys like Green, Hill, and even current JR taking semi-contested 3's if the alternative is LeBron James 1v1 against someone driving to the rim. There was such little help all game."
"11 players have averaged 24+ PPG in their age 21 season (including Booker).   Of the 10 that came before Booker, the ones who ended up with a 30 PPG season are: Bernard King, T-Mac, Rick Barry, Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, LeBron James.  The ones who missed it: Anthony Davis and KAT (so far), Shaq missed it by 0.3 PPG in 2000, and Melo missed it by 1.1 PPG in 2007.  So based on past history it would at least seem like Booker has a strong chance to come close. "
"I mean if he joined the Rockets, I think that would hurt him. People *still* won't get over KD to the Warriors. If James Harden and LeBron team up after the Rockets either make the finals (W or L) or lose to the eventual champion Warriors, that's going to look bad on LeBron, just like it did KD. If people don't criticize him for it, they're hypocrites. "
"If that's an average speed, it's not very informative. It probably just has to do with the fact that [Lebron walks a lot to conserve energy](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23384071/lebron-james-plays-rests-keep-cleveland-cavaliers-hopes-alive)."
So we don't have our small PG repeatedly massacred by forcibly getting switched onto LeBron James on literally every possession in every meaningful playoff game. 
"Man we've been through alot this year and only one thing didn't change in my mind.    Never count LeBron James out, the man just hates to lose..."
"Neymar:  x3 more search score than Lebron James  x2 more followers than Lebron James  But hey Lebron makes x2 more in endorsement money (which by the way it's the most stupid way of measuring popularity) so Lebron is more popular.  Just look at the number 10 position.  ESPN creates these lists to promote American athletes, especially Basketball and golf players."
"That Bulls team was no doubt one of the best of all time, but I'd still rank GSW above them on name and talent alone. You gotta remember, the GSW team won 73 games without Durant on their team. They didn't win the title that year because Lebron James and Kyrie happened but 8/10 times they would have. "
**WHAT???? I'M SORRY BUT I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER ALL OF THE LEBRON JAMES**
"While impressive, it is important to keep in context.  Specifically, VORP is, in many ways, a counting stat.  As such, the fact that LeBron played so many more games than a guy like Jordan heavily skews this stat.  If you calculate Jordan's per game VORP and extrapolate to Lebron's number of playoff games, you get 32.0 for LeBron and 29.7 for Jordan, which is fairly close.  When you add in other factors such as the much better approach to efficiency in today's NBA (i.e. James shoots 3's at almost double the rate of Jordan in the playoffs), the fact that first rounds being extended to 7 games series giving more games against weaker opponents, etc. the difference/gap closes even more.  Some of these differences can be addressed by looking at a stat that is more normalized to a straight per minute production like PER.  Using PER, LeBron is at 28.2 compared to Jordan's 28.6.  Basically, like everything else, they are *both* absolutely amazing players who know how to perform when the stakes are the highest."
LeBron James is a good basketball player
"&gt;“He is numero uno when it comes to making players around him better,” Korver said. “He obviously puts you in situations to succeed, but he just exudes confidence. How he talks to you: He’s intense, he’s fired up. He just breeds confidence in the guys. The situations he puts you in because of his skill level and then his personality and his leadership, it just elevates guys around him.”    &gt;""So I told him, I said, ‘Thank you,’ because I made one boneheaded defensive play, and also, a missed free throw, so I’m just glad he’s on my side.” - Jeff Green    &gt;""It’s pretty amazing,"" George Hill said about playing with James. ""This guy gets so much criticism for all he does but if you really get to know him, he’s one of the nicest teammates you can ever have and one of the coolest guys I’ve been around.    &gt;“He’s somebody you can learn from every day, takes the game very serious,” Rose says. “He’s professional and, come on man, it’s like a blessing being here.”    &gt;“He just brings it every single day,” Derrick Williams said. “Sometimes when you have star caliber players like that it can vary, but he’s really big on bringing it every single day. His work ethic spreads throughout this whole locker room.”    &gt;“If you compete and play basketball the right way he’ll be one of the great teammates you’ll ever have,” Richard Jefferson said. “That’s what he prides himself on, is high level competition and guys playing the right way. He works extremely hard and the guys we bring in here follow in that same mold so that’s not hard for guys to pick up on.""   Nah but you know what it's like to play with LeBron."
"&gt;but have you ever wondered why Boston even went 7 games with THIS Cavs team?  'Cause they had LeBron James, wtf is this question? "
&gt;Never forget that this dude played in a pitiful Eastern Conference in his prime and still never took his team anywhere  You could say the same thing for LeBron James. One measly Finals appearance where he got swept. Take 2007 out of the equation and LeBron's first stint in Cleveland is entirely forgettable.   See how that works?   &gt;He should thank Kevin Garnett every day for him having even a modicum of a winning legacy.  The way Kobe should wake up and thank Shaq and Pau? You remember Bryant demanded a trade from the Lakers on national radio because he couldn't even get them to the 2nd round by himself? 
"&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James is the first player in NBA Finals history to lead both teams in points, assists and rebounds for the entire series, according to ESPN.  &gt;James averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists across six Finals games.   I actually watched this entire series, not just the highlights, and LeBron was phenomenal.  He took 2 games off the champs with a starting lineup of Mozgov, TT, Delavedova, Shumpert and essentially a 7 man rotation (JR and James Jones).  How can you call this ""pretty bad""?"
"I'm convinced this is a huge reason Lebron doesn't get more free throws. He just goes through contact and doesn't usually sell it when he's shooting. He'll flop in other areas, but most of the time around the rim he's just looking to score.   A good example is last night when Lebron got the steal under the basket, Smart hacked the shit out of him, but since he's strong and doesn't sell it nothing was called  If Lebron was as willing to sell contact as say James Harden he would easily get 6 more FTAs a game"
"I got here from the frontpage, and know nothing of sports, although I do think LeBron James is pretty amazing. So, when you said ""Gronk"" I didn't realize you were talking about an actual football player, and thought you were talking about Kronk from Emperor's New Groove. The great thing about this is that your statement about Lebron still makes sense. "

This is the stat sheet from the 1998 Western Conference Semifinal Lakers vs Sonics and this counts as one of the series where Kobe supposedly beat a 50 win team.  Give me a fucking break.  I was wondering how many of these 50 win series were with Shaq and luckily [this reddit post from 1 year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/592w3z/kobe_vs_lebron_50win_playoff_teams/) had them all laid out. 14/24 were with Shaq which means undoubtedly Kobe was the 2nd best player on his team during almost all those series because he rarely outplayed Shaq in a series and certainly didn't over his first 3/4 years.   I just need to say this because I think this either gets forgotten by the youngsters or just ignored but Kobe Bryant was the 2nd best player on his team for the first 8 years of his career in which he won 3 of his 5 championships and made 4 of his 7 Finals appearances.  Lebron James has been the best player on every team he's ever played on and shouldered all the blame for his entire career.
Imagine going to LA and making roughly $180m and also getting to star alongside LeBron James in the next SpaceJam movie that will probably make roughly the same amount that Avengers Infinity War has made.
"Reminder that Boston fans are against the idea of shipping off most of their assets while still keeping say Horford and Tatum to create a new Big 3 with LeBron and guys like Towns, Leonard, maybe CP3 or George, you never know, because they're in a series with the worst iteration of a LeBron James team in 7 years."
"Dude we're not talking about a player no one ever hears about. This is LeBron James. He's on the Mount Rushmore of basketball. He has a chance to score the most points in the history of the NBA. How do you look at his career and say, ""yeah I thought he was just a flopping whiny baby""?"
Full time president and CEO of the LeBron James Fan Club^TM
"It would appear from his interview with Doris Burke that if you inspect his teeth close enough, you would find that LeBron has opted for silver fillings for his cavities, which is widely regarded as a less aesthetic option. With LeBron James being very wealthy, the difference between a silver filling and filling that mimics his natural tooth color would literally be a fraction of pennies. Therefore confirming that widespread rumor that Lebron is cheap af"
"On the way out, brother LeBron James Junior hugged brother DeMar DeRozan and said ""y'all looked so different"""
"Exactly. He knows that against any other eastern team, he can afford to give up a game to test the waters. Of course he’s *trying* to win the feel out games, and he does a lot of the time (especially against run Raps, fml), but he knows that no matter what the East scraps together he’s Lebron James and his team will always have the advantage because of that.  You’re up 1-0 against Lebron? No big deal. Lebron is still better than your team.  But against the Warriors? You give them the chance to go up 1-0 against you and unless a miracle happens (3-1 baby) you essentially gave up the series. Lebron doesn’t feel out the Warriors because that’s just suicide."
"Again, in 2012 Durant had a stacked team. If you knew anything about basketball you would know the significance of fatigue.  Durant and Westbrook wore down in 2016 because of the load they were carrying and the minutes they were playing. That's why suddenly their shots were short in those 4th quarters later in the series.  It happened to Harden in 2017 against the Spurs. The load James was carrying was too much and the minutes too high.  It happened to Lebron and Dellevadova in the 2015 Finals. Both were visibly gassed in the later games in those series. Delly had to go to the hospital and Lebron could barely move in postgame press conferences and kept ice all over his legs over his pants even as he left.  In Game 3 of the Finals last year Lebron and Kyrie's shots were all short late in the 4th and it's because of all the minutes they played fighting the Warriors. Then Kevin Durant comes into the game well rested halfway through and of course his shots would not be short because he had energy. After Game 4 Kyrie specifically talked about the difference the rest he got made to help the Cavs close Game 4: https://youtu.be/BpCOD_ERsJo?t=7m30s  &gt;He outplayed LeBron offensively   Playmaking and passing is part of offense. Lebron averaged 10 assists along with 33 points. Durant averaged 35 points and 5 assists."
That video is questionable. Lebron just missed a free throw and may have been mad at himself for doing that. Lebron was absurd in the 2013 and 2014 finals offensively the difference is we held him to 4 assists per game in 2014.  &gt;Video tracking shows that James shot 12-of-18 (66.7 percent) with Leonard as his primary defender in the first three games of the 2014 NBA Finals.  http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91407/kawhi-leonard-wreaking-havoc-on-lebron
So cool that Lebron named his daughter after Uncle James from Wakanda.
"Sorry not terrible D but very average to below average.  He played D a lot like Lebron does now; takes possessions off, plays free safety (sags off his guy, gives up open shots).      I'm a Lakers fan. I'm a Kobe fan.  It was a yearly joke (especially after Shaq left) when he was named all defense over guys like Bruce Bowen, Shane Battier, James Posey, Kirk Heinrich etc. etc.      He was just a lock whether he played good D or not.    "
Michael Jordan &lt;&gt; Lebron James
"This is what I'd do:  Then u/TheSquidSquad got down on his knees and ripped LeBron's shorts off. LeBron was so surprised he couldn't move. u/TheSquidSquad took one look at The King's girthy member, and then promptly took it in his mouth. LeBron recovered from his initial shock, and asked u/TheSquidSquad what he was doing. u/TheSquidSquad pretended like he didn't hear him, and continued to fellate his teammate. Lebreon began to moan softly, and his eyes slowly rolled back into his head. His moaning grew louder and louder, and became uniform, almost like a hum. u/TheSquidSquad also began to hum while still performing oral sex. Their humming continued to grow louder, and other Cavs players began to hum as well. As James neared climax, he began to levitate, his feet leaving the floor. At this point, his eyes had completely rolled back into his head, so his eyes were pure white. LeBron soon levitated high enough that u/TheSquidSquad was forced to cease his fellatio. As the entire Cavs team's humming reached a crescendo, LeBron rotated like a spinning top, still hovering a few feet off the locker room floor. He rotated at such a speed that he became a blur. All of a sudden, the humming ceased and LeBron vanished into a point in space. The locker room was then in stunned silence. LeBron reappeared in a flash, sitting in the same chair he was initially sitting in. Still no one dared speak. After what seemed like an eternity, LeBron James broke the silence. He simply said, ""I'm ready for game 5""."

"Everything is forgotten in that way.  This. This will not be forgotten.  It will be one of the top 5 ""sister"" topics when discussing Lebron James...or Michael Jordan (because LBJ continues to be brought up everytime MJ is). Someone on some show will talk about this every day, for years and years. Until it is only discussed weekly. Or now and again by announcers. But it will be in the books. The great basketball books in the future will mark this period and discuss the Warriors' and LeBron's greatness. And if the Warriors win just two more titles, there will always be that trailing sentence negging on the Warriors and Durant and the particular epiphany of circumstance and opportunity. We got to see the greatest team ever, at the price of the greatest multi-year Finals sequence ever and forever what-ifing of the GOAT's career."

Windhorst wrote an article on it after the 2015 season  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/14000537/nba-lebron-james-back-issues-more-apparent
Iggy is straight the best Lebron defender ever. Kawhi has never been able to disrupt James what the Spurs do is lock up everyone but him.
"It's not even just that, it's that Lebron passing on it has sort of started a trend of stars not participating. It's crazy to me that we've never even seen Westbrook or Lebron James in a dunk contest when we see what they can do in game.  It used to be HUGE names in the dunk contest. MJ won it twice including during an MVP year, Nique won it, Kobe won it, Vince Carter won it.  John Wall was probably the last star to win it who was an established star at the time. It's just not held at the same level anymore and I think it's a shame."
at this point. i'm struggling to believe Lebron James retirement is a myth
Kyle Korver is the LeBron James of he NBA in that his longevity is astounding.
"Bill Russell   Kareem Abdul-jabbar  Michael Jordan  LeBron James  These players totally dominated their eras and have defined NBA history more than any others imo. They all have at least 4 MVPs as well, which is at least worth noting "
I don't think an elbow from LEBRON JAMES is the same as an elbow from other players.
"I'd love to think maybe you're just being thrown in with the other bad laker fans who have ruined it for everyone else but your first post was  &gt; Lebron James is the most overrated defenders in history  Followed by   &gt; Kobe Bryant is the most underrated defender in history on r/NBA   Yeah.. the problem isn't the flair, the problem is you "

That wasn't even the best Lebron James.
he did try and recruit him to Notre Dame  http://www.espn.com/blog/bigten/post/_/id/133392/remembering-that-time-urban-meyer-tried-to-recruit-lebron-james
"LOL they're doing same, if not more physical, to Lebron James"
Yeah 12/year wasn't that bad in Parker's era. Lebron James was only making 14.5-18mill for his heat tenure. That's Lebron fucking James lol
"&gt;Not big enough? No perimeter player is big enough to guard LeBron then, you realize Smart is a better defender than Tatum right? Yes they absolutely do have the personnel to guard James. Smart, Brown, Tatum, Morris, Horford. That's an entire line up that can switch anything, they are probably the most dynamic defensive team in the league. That's how you guard LBJ, by being DYNAMIC.  Again like I said, you also need a guy like Kawhi or Butler who both have shown the ability to make Lebron work. Both guys are elite defenders which is crucual to guard Lebron.  &gt;Also we can actually scrap the whole East vs West thing right now and just look at finals, we don't even need to argue about strength of conference. LBJ has 6 40 point games against arguable the best/one of the best teams of ALL time in the finals, so yes he would put 40 on any teams head. Doesn't matter the conference.  I don't deny that at all, I was speaking more to how other greats would have more favorable stats playing weaker competition in the East. Not disparaging Lebron at all."
The thot TT cheated with/Joey Crawford/Sam Cassell/LeBron James
No way jose. And do you know why? Because that fuck would be getting demolished if it were not for a god like creature on his team scoring and making plays regardless of whoever the fuck is on the floor or whoever the fuck is guarding him. Lebron James is the godfather of the NBA and Lue is just along for the ride. Dont fucking kid yourself fam.
Wow. Thanos' quote went flawlessly with that. Who said Lebron James at the end though lol

LeBron James?
"I love this Cs team.  I hope I'm wrong.  But I don't see the issue with predicting that LeBron James will beat this Cs team in a three game series, even without HCA.  It's freaking LeBron James lol."
"Malone and Stockton are not the consensus anything anymore. Steph Curry, right now, is better than either of them ever were. And Durant is possibly better than that. Lots of people put either KG, Dirk, or both above Malone. Jeff Hornacek made one all-star team, and it wasnt at 34 years old, for Utah.  They have a bunch of good players, but the 1996 supersonics would still probably be the worst team LeBron ever played in the finals. It's cool they had the greatest defensive guard, but they needed him to be their best offensive player too. Is he a top 5 PG in 2018? Maybe he's 5th?  Malone won his MVPs at an advanced age, because 95-2000 is one of the weakest eras. The draft classes from 88-91 only had 4 combined Hall of Famers, so you had all these mid-30-year-olds still dominating the sport. In the current NBA, you have *one*, LeBron James.   When Bird and Magic were 32-33, Jordan was there. When Kobe declined, LeBron was ready. LeBron is fighting valiantly, but there are multiple potential top 20 guys ever coming for him. 96-98 is this barren spot between Jordan's peak and Duncan/Kobe/Dirk/KG. Penny Hardaway and Grant Hill weren't historic players. Durant and Curry are.  Granted, you're probably right that saying the combined version of Utah and Seattle would have no shot is hyperbolic. But it's definitely a series GS *could* win, which is remarkable in of itself.  **edit:** It's important to point out that I'm not saying that MJ had a weak era. Jordan dominated a really strong era. But the era that was *supposed* to be after Jordan was pretty weak, and we had to wait until the early 2000s for the next great generation to arrive.  All the talk about LeBron's finals record completely ignores that he faced much better finals opponents than Jordan. I was responding to someone saying ""he's gonna be 3-6."" "

"When asked about his failed attempt to recruit LeBron, Urban Meyer said that he thought LeBron would be a HOFer. ([source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2609589-the-failed-college-football-recruitment-of-lebron-james))  And keep in mind that Meyer apparently didn't realize that LeBron was bound for the NBA - his assessment was solely based on what his own football scouts were telling him.  Physical skills don't normally translate between sports, but a lot of experts in football thought that LeBron's would.   That said, LeBron was a wide receiver, not a QB."
"Great scene in Cavs locker room. Korver was FaceTiming his daughter, Jaylen Brown. She asked to see LeBron James. Someone brought the phone over to LeBron and she said “good game!” LeBron responded, “Not me, that was your Dad.” "

"Our attendance numbers were right in line with league average, even during the darkest hours of The Process. Our spike in attendance is no different than the spike the Heat experienced with Shaq. Our difference is that we held the middle with no superstar. Of course Wade and LeBron will sell tickets but even Game 6 isn't enough to keep the fans in their seats. Philly fans never walk out on their team the way Heat fans did. Our city shows up for our teams. Your city comes and goes like hurricane. There's passionate fans and fair weather fans in each fanbase. We'll see what happens to the Heat fans once they start failing to reach the second round led by Whiteside and his poor attitude, work ethic, and talent.   James Johnson is a punk who backed down when JoJo came over. Tyler Johnson looks like an overdose. Wade has a history of dirty plays. The first result of Dragic on YouTube is him slapping Simmons in the back of the head. Ben's first result is his Aussie 60 minutes interview. "
"I mean, Houston literally had their record breaking season, MVP in Harden, got Paul, Capella a monster, great role players, but they are still having trouble beating the Warriors. LeBron James can average 45 PPG, and the Cavs could still lose by 40 by this Warriors team. "

I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR LEBRON JAMES
"And I think the bigger take-away should be these different edicts given to refs before a specific assignment. If true, and they are doing a specific video study on how poor officiating has benefited a certain player or team, you're increasingly the likelihood that player or team is going to be officiated differently than the expect norm. Perhaps, officiated correctly, as opposed to incorrectly. But I don't think that's something that should change from game to game. Moreover, there are so many missed calls and poor decisions game to game, it seems unfair to pick out one player or type of play. I mean, LeBron James steps over the free throw line almost every time-- that's not addressed. LeBron James travels all the time, that's not addressed. LeBron James pushes off with his off hand on drives, that's not addressed. It's silly. "
"I'm not saying LeBron is going to Philly\- in fact the whole Bryan Colangelo thing has probably made it less likely.  But I'm not a big fan of the ""fit is weird"" argument.    People wondered whether LeBron and Wade could coexist before his 4 years in Miami, and people wondered whether LeBron and Kyrie could share the basketball before Lebron returned to Cleveland.  I look at it this way\- Take a 52 win team with a 21 yr old superstar PG and a 23 year old superstar C and replace Ersan Ilyasova's and Marco Belinelli's minutes with LeBron James.  How is that not a perennial contender, even as LeBron eventually hits an inevitable decline?  Yeah, Ben Simmons needs to work on cutting without the ball, and on his post game, and no he doesn't have a jump shot, but his ability to bring the ball up the court against pressure and initiate the offense would take a huge burden off LeBron's shoulders.  LeBron must be absolutely exhausted right now, and the idea of playing on a team where he can realistically play 30\-35 mpg instead of 40\-45 mpg must be incredibly appealing.  And he must see that the writing is on the wall in Cleveland with their best players mostly towards the tail end of their careers and no cap space to bring in fresh talent."

"That Heat team was a playoff team, and not even seen as a legitimate championship contender before LeBron and Bosh went to Miami and began to rebuild it. I literally hate the fact that James went to Miami and even I can see he went there to build a contender. He didn't join a team that was already at the top. Don't play like there isn't a difference."
"I don’t disagree that PED testing should be more stringent, but I do disagree with the underlying premise and your certainty that the top players in the league are doping/roiding up. It’s productive to apply stringent scientific logic here (yes I’m a scientist). How do you “know” Lebron James is roiding up? Where is the evidence and why does your evidence support your hypothesis? Can you rule out other models that explain his success in recent seasons? This claim is problematic because you’re pretty strongly lacking in evidence. You can cite Lebron’s overall health, his size, and his ability to be performing this well at his age, but jumping straight to the idea that he’s using illegal substances as a boost is problematic because nothing you cite as evidence rules out any competing models, such as attributing his performance to his stringent diet, intense workout/practice routines, and his coasting during the regular season in order to be fresh for the playoffs. In the absence of evidence to either conclusively point to doping or to rule out other models, your claim doesn’t have much support.   TL;DR more testing for PEDs/Doping is good, but going from there to strongly stating that the top players are doping is a problematic leap in the absence of compelling evidence that conclusively points to your hypothesis or rules out competing models. Also science is important and stuff."
"If steroids are allowed then everyone can do them. It's not unfair at that point. Genetics and team rosters are more unfair than everyone having the ability to use steroids and some not doing so. Much like supplements. We're not talking 80s baseball roids  Let me clarify the genetics thing because that might come across as a joke. It's not. If a player has more skill than LeBron James but is 6'1"", he will never be as good as LeBron. That's unfair."
"Lebron is a force of James, scouring the maple with the shredded faces of fallen execs"
"Ego, basically. Both his and Ainge's and Kyrie's possibly Brad's (though the latter is never discussed because he seemingly doesn't have one).   LeBron has hated the Celtics for a long time, they're the team that pushed him out of Cleveland the first time and made him a villain. We don't know what Danny Ainge's feelings toward LBJ are but he probably doesn't want to cede the kind of power that LeBron demands from all of the GMs he joins (we know this because he's forced coaching changes in Cleveland and tried to do so in Miami). Ainge is the best GM in the league, he might be reluctant to bring on a player who demands that kind of power.  Kyrie has obvious issues with LeBron, or at least he had issues with Cleveland (an organization set up and run by LeBron James for all intents and purposes). No way to know if he'd be cool with a reunion.  And finally LeBron has no regard for his coaches. He tried to get Spolestra fired basically before the LeBron Heat began, he's extremely inconsistent on defense, he's ball-dominant, and he probably wouldn't get the perks that Lue affords him (like letting LeBron take technical free throws even when Korver and Love are on the floor).   So in theory it's possible but there are a lot of human problems that might prevent it from happening. "
"at this point it's better for the org for this to be provably true. if it is you can just fire him and try to put it behind you, but if they can't prove anything then you have a lot of pissed off people and a lot of tension around the organization without any clear outlet for it. imagine trying to recruit lebron james with this still in the air"
"How does it destroy that circle jerk/argument? If anything it reiterates/strengthens that point; CP3 would never have even attempted teaming up with James Harden in the first place if it wasn’t for the near impossible task of dethroning the Warriors, and even still that task is so unlikely that they now have to bring Lebron into the mix (and still nothing is guaranteed).   When Lebron moved to Miami, he didn’t destroy the parity of the league for years to come. In fact, they failed to win the chip that very year. KD lost one game during his entire playoff run in his first year with GSW.   &gt; especially since everyone is convinced the Rockets would beat these Warriors if both were at full strength  Straw man argument... KD ruined the NBA for the time being and if Lebron joins the Rockets, it will only strengthen that point further imo. "
I think Harden has basically peaked. He’s playing at an mvp level at 29 he’s not going to get significantly better.   If Lebron goes to the rockets they probably have to let capela go.  Well obviously James and harden are better than anyone on the Celtics roster but the Celtics when healthy could have the best starting 5 in the league next year plus bench pieces. Rockets would only have their big 3 since they basically have to let everyone else go to have to space to sign lebron 
"and you have to take in to account harden and capela are continuing to improve,  and lebron james is way better than anyone on the celtics roster. and so is james harden.  where exactly does boston have any advantage? if you go h2h with the top 7 guys, which match ups does boston win?"
"Cavs need to play as many three point threats as possible. Replace Clarkson with Jose Calderon and see if you can give some minutes to Rodney Hood.  You will then have  Lebron James  Kevin Love  Kyle Korver  JR Smith  Rodney Hood  Jose Calderon  As your three point threats, Lebron will have to drive and kick, and hope that they hit enough 3s. Plus Rodney Hood will be a decent defender of KD, and I think Jose Calderon can play some spot minutes on Steph/Livingston."
Honestly would need at least 3 first rounders IMO. You’re dumping a contract AND getting Lebron James. That is insane. I don’t even think it’s possible but it would be cool to see it happen. 
"Yes it is all about matchups, I agree.     But this statement doesn’t begin to cover my point about D’Antoni’s shortcomings as a HC for a handful of different organizations — two of which featured the league’s MVP as his starting PG (Nash) &amp; SG (let’s be real here, unfortunately this season’s MVP awarded will go to Harden despite his regular season being what voters considered the least unappealing choice while also not voting for LeBron because voter fatigue bullshit etc.), James Harden — almost always having sufficiently talented rosters to compete for a title.      Both in his PHX era &amp; his current Houston tenure, MDA (and his assistants/rest of coaching staff), have bizarrely failed to even entertain the concept of using the season to ease the weaker members of the team into comfortable amounts of game-time minutes shared with at least one or two of the starting lineup’s best player, (rather than only using them with each other aka other bench players so long as it’s in blowout victory game’s most meaningless final garbage time - where zero confidence is inspired by a coach in a player b/c it sends the message, “This is how little I respect or trust you &amp; the idea of your game improving with this team.”)     I know how harsh that sounds, but again there’s a reason the best coaches have been able to get seemingly impossible to use players - or even just rookies/inexperienced players - to slowly over 82 games each year go from a mindset of, “I’m just happy to be here,” to, “I am a part of this team &amp; I know I can hold my own if my number gets called later on simply from valuable experience/minutes over the season that I shared with one (or more) of our team’s best players” etc.     Anyway, if you disagree that’s cool, I’m not trying to argue so much as be as clear as possible. I think I’ve written enough about my thoughts on this matter throughout these comments, and I hope I don’t sound argumentative as it’s not my intention at all. Obviously I do feel confident in my opinion about the importance of a HC doing everything they can to integrate their entire arsenal of players at their disposal, while MDA feels confident about sticking to a certain 7 guys he trusts to work through the extra minutes &amp; fatigue. He’s a highly celebrated &amp; deservedly recognized HC for NBA teams as well as Olympic teams, so I also understand how I’m perhaps not the most credible person to argue this point. Welp. *shrugs*     **Thanks for responding. I’m sorry I wrote a novel at you :/ Cheers.** "
Wow...a great NBA article and Lebron James wasn’t mentioned once. Not sure the last time that happened!!!
"https://twitter.com/SI_LeeJenkins/status/1000934409883738113  &gt; ""You put my mother on the floor, and if she were in a Boston Celtics uniform, I'd break her face."" -- LeBron James, in an interview with me six years ago."
"Sure it does. It means really good but not as good as Lebron James. Well, ok, no one in the East has been as good as Lebron James for like a decade. The Celtics and the 76ers aren't contenders either."
"I mean, good defense and 12 boards per game in the playoffs would be more consistent than anyone not named Lebron James in this playoffs for the Cavs."
Atlanta Hawks: Domnique   Kings: Chris Webber  76ers: Dr. J with Iverson a close second   Cavs: Lebron James  Mavericks:  Dirk  Suns: Charles Barkley or Steve Nash  Jazz: Karl Malone  Toronto: Vince Carter  Knicks: Patrick Ewing  Lakers: Kareem or Magic Johnson  Magic: Shaq  Pelicans: Anthony Davis    
"LeBron “King of the Kings” James and Chris Paul choose the Sacramento Kings to take over and create a three way war in California with the Warriors and the newly contending Lakers who acquire PG13, Kawhi, and Boogie. This leads to a new era called “the California Triangle”"
&gt; Heat : Dwyane Wade and Lebron James  FTFY
&gt;competitive series with a new champions n is better than a non competitive series with the same champion  &gt;playoffs were super entertaining in the east  Lebron James is going to his **8th** straight finals coming out of the east. Gtfoh
"You don't know what you're talking about. Here's an article to help you:  [http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1743142\-timeline\-of\-dwyane\-wades\-lengthy\-injury\-history](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1743142-timeline-of-dwyane-wades-lengthy-injury-history)  Fresh off the 2011 NBA lockout, Wade's health appeared an ominous warning in advance of Miami's attempt to improve upon its 2011 defeat to the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals. By the end of January, he'd missed nine of the Heat's 21 games.  In addition to a strained calf and a bruised left foot that kept him out of three games, Wade suffered a sprained right ankle that put the cherry on top of his early struggles \(via ESPN's [Michael Wallace](http://espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/7464874/miami-heat-unsure-dwyane-wade-status-injuries-pile-up)\):   &gt;**Wade told reporters in** [Denver](http://bleacherreport.com/denver-nuggets) **that he had never experienced pain from a sprain as severely as what he felt Friday. He also made light of his recent rash of injuries being a sign that he's getting older. Wade turns 30 on Tuesday.**  However many times Wade's been around the sun, discerning his age in NBA years is a little like trying to figure out [how old](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3351418) Miguel Tejada was back in the day. It's ultimately a guessing game where birth certificates mean absolutely nothing.  Fast\-forward to the postseason, and a familiar problem began haunting Wade's attempts to earn teammate LeBron James his first title."
"I just started rooting for LeBron this year (outside of the Finals), but I'd go back to hating him *quick as fuck* if he did this  As nice as it'd be to see the Warriors have some legit competition, James Harden and Chris Paul being apart of the next dynasty would hurt me in the heart"
“LeBron James would look great in a Lakers jersey”  “Steph Curry would look great in a Lakers jersey”  “KD would look great in a Lakers jersey”  “PG would look great in a Lakers jersey”
"LeBron James!  His true feelings on his teammates will be leaked, but instead of getting down they decide to give it their all in the finals to prove him wrong.  LeBron has a 0/0/0/0/0/0/0 statline, Cavs win in 3.  KD leaves Golden State to join the Cavs midway through game 2.  At the end of the year they get KD to sign a 10 year max deal.  Then they trade all the good players for second round unprotected picks from playoff teams and he spends the rest of his career eking out 22 wins a year with the refuse that they draft.  LeBron also leaves in case that's not clear.  Sorry Cleveland, but it's for the greater good."
LeBron James
I don’t think Capela remains such an important and integral part of the rockets game plan if the have Lebron fuckin James lol. LBJ can battle down in the paint and get rebounds and dunk off alley oops just fine. 
"....I totally agree. I have a few friends who think he was in the right though.  Same as I’m not particularly a fan of LeBron but there are a bunch who really like the guy.  I don’t actually think LeBron James is evil or anything though, I just thought it was a neat comparison. Screw it."
"I know this has nothing to do with what you posted, but you can’t say “him” when referring to LeBron when the last persons name that you said was James Harden.  Anyways..I’m a Lebron fan so this post doesn’t really have to do with me"
"""Hello, you have reached the voice mail of Lebron James. Please do not leave a message, Lebron will not get back to you as he is busy preparing for the NBA Finals."""
"For those wondering, the players are Lebron James (CLE) Kyle Korver (CLE) Kendrick Perkins (CLE, played 1 game) David West (GSW) Zaza Pachulia (GSW) Dwyane Wade (MIA) Carmelo Anthony (OKC) Nick Collision (OKC, played 15 games, retired)"
This may eliminate the 6ers chance to acquire lebron James.  Houston still the front runner but la back in the Running. Remember lebron is not just a basketball player he is a spokesman for human rights 
Especially if you're trying to sign fucking LeBron James
You underestimate how many Lebron James fans and haters there are.  
"Shane Battier, James Jones, David Griffin, Rich Paul - tons of options that could close LeBron.   Unfortunately, Magic Johnson isn't available. He's the best by far. "
Those two seem perfect here. Cavs need a star to keep Lebron James home. Only problem with MPJ is will you play Bron at the 4 if you make this pick?
"&gt; The Warriors and Cavs were fairly evenly matched back then  People here have maintained the Warriors have been an unstoppable 73 win juggernaut, you yourself have just admitted they choked.  &gt;Also Lebron didn’t create the trend of stars teaming up, it has been that way since forever.  Of course he didn't, but even before when stars teamed up, they were already aging, or on the decline. See Malone/Payton in LA, Boston's Big 3 who were all in their 30's. LeBron made it ok for stars to team up in their primes. Deny it all you want, [this is not even a new take](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/10/26/16550508/how-lebron-james-shaped-the-nba)"
&gt; What puts this over the top is that Patrick McCaw and Steph Curry are going to haunt LeBron James’ nightmares for the next decade…probably.  I expect nothing less from team blogs lol. Love the pettiness   And it’s probably the video from the Christmas matchup 
"A big point people are missing. If you try to recruit LeBron right now, you are admitting you don't think he can win this series before they have even played a game. That's is exactly the kind of mentality James HATES. So the biggest recruiting mistake you could possibly make right now in regards to James is assume the Cavs lose this. He's going to think, what happens when I get on that team and they go down 3-1?"
"""Lebron James joined a 65 win team that didn't need him!""  I hope those of you bitching about KD will stay consistent. "
Yeah Nike is behind all the “If Paul George and LeBron James went to the Rockets their starting lineup would be Paul George LeBron James” posts
LeBron could still be the GOAT but Jordon definitely had better defense that James.  Highlight chase down blocks are not the same thing as consistent defensive effort.  
"Honestly this could help your LeBron chances.   You know Colangelo would have fucked it up. So now you have an excuse to fire Colangelo and bring in a LeBron specialist. For example, James Jones (just an extreme example, not suggesting him specifically). "

[how the Rockets could sign LeBron](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/12/11/16761746/lebron-james-rockets-free-agency-salary-cap-how) (4 scenarios)
"Yes, it does. Creating &amp; scoring are combined in many analysis to gauge a players overall contribution. See: James Harden &amp; LeBron James.   My post reflects that you lied. Own up to it and move on.  "
Lebron James is a very dear dear friend of mine. I'll have you know we both once liked the same IG pic and we are only 5 people away from 10 people away from knowing each other.
"I think it was mostly just an awful half of shooting and health issues. I'm sure players were tired too but I think everyone probably goes through that to a similar extent.   Every team could use LeBron James. Get him, worry about fit later."
&gt;Melo    “Oh yeah uh about that.”    LeBron James
&gt; How does that work when your 3 goes from being Trevor Ariza to LeBron James  Didn't we just do this shit last offseason? LeBron James is an improvement. He would improve the basketball team.
"I understand that.  That doesn't change the fact that all 3 of those dudes need the ball. Right now, they only have 2 dudes and they basically have one on the floor at all times so they dont get in each other's way. How does that work when your 3 goes from being Trevor Ariza to LeBron James?"
Are Chris Paul and James Harden really ready to go from being regarded as superstars to the trash LeBron had to carry through the playoffs for 2-4 years? 
"That would be a good nickname for a super team.  How would they be assigned? My picks —  Time stone: maybe James Harden for his stop-start craftiness?  Mind stone: Chris Paul of course   Power stone: LeBron, naturally   Soul stone: ?  Reality stone: ?  "
"&gt;Don't get me wrong: There will still be plenty of talk over the next two weeks about what James will do July 1 and the growing belief that he'll be leaving his home-state Cavaliers this offseason to join a team better suited to consistently challenge Golden State. Rest assured that the Rockets' understandably devastated Chris Paul — who made a fast exit from Toyota Center late Monday night after being forced to watch the biggest game of his life from the bench because of his hamstring injury — has already begun his recruitment of James to Houston.  &gt;But LeBron is still playing, people. "
I didn’t have to. I just saw LeBron James.
"i think it’ll come down to Dwight, Deandre Jordan , and LeBron James"
"Bigger than LeBron James? Man, fuck no. Jordan, sold. Kobe, sold. Magic, sold. The players did that shit, not the brand. "
"Nah this happenes ever year lebron starts dominating the Eastern Conference finals and thats when the world keeps saying LBJ &gt; MJ until he loses then they're are saying ""haha MJ was 6 for 6"" the whole fucking offseason and early league season, Then as it gets later in the season and his teams start having that trouble they saying ""LBJ past his prime"" while they all hype up the current ""mvp"" front runner who's team his really just better(I still think previous mvps deserved the awards since they were a big part of their teams dominating) until it gets late in the season close to the playoffs and the media starts really talking about his stats and because he's fucking Lebron James they're amazing that starts a while bunch of lebron stans to come out and start yelling he's the real mvp which is boosted 100x folds when he dominates the playoffs in the eastern conference thats when people like you start saying ""it's different this year"" because they are sucked into the colossal hype of the best player in the world but then is quickly reminded that the west star power is just unreal sometimes  with how many there is and how well they can play together(the west always have super teams with players who just fit right its crazy) and of course lebron does his very best and sometimes if everything aligns and just right his greatness along with a good supporting cast of of 2 allstar level talent(one all star might be good on the stat sheet but the second one is probably doing all the little things better) and just good play by the bench and players rising up to the occasion earns him a ring now lebron has done this 3 times to powerhouses on top of dominating a entire fucking conference CONFERENCE for 8 years  but when its all daid and done when he loses another one the MJ stans will come out and use the ""6 for 6 arguement to death"" and it's just a repeating cycle of bullshit this why i think the league and this whole world is just a tv series on its 13th fucking season. If you read all this and understood it because im pretty sure i was rambling i commend you."
"[These](https://www.acct.org/default.php?url=/NBA-Cleveland-Cavaliers-23-Lebron-James-Blue-Cavs-Throwback-Authentic-Jersey-263.html) were my favorite, but obviously the black Adidas ones will hold a special place in my heart."
"rofl. I'm nearly 30 and have been watching the Warriors since the late 90s, have some respect.   With that being said, GS intentionally limits Andre's minutes during the regular season so that he can play big minutes come playoff time. He is the second best defender on the team and a big part of their defensive schemes. Before he got hurt Harden and Paul were 1-41 shooting against him. Dude locked down Lebron mf James in multiple Finals and you're out here saying he's trash because he's not one of the best basketball players in the league like his teammates.  The Rockets were +6 in two wins w/o Iggy and Paul.. This series goes 5 games w/ Iggy in there."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"This is just for visibility in the thread, but the Cavs front office petitioned for a flagrant 2 on the play, the same way the Warriors front office petitioned against punishing Dray for his nut kick to Adams.  There are no stories anywhere saying LeBron lobbied for anything relating to this incident.    His only public statement was as follows:  &gt;""I don't know what should happen. It's not my call. That's the league office. They'll take a look at it,"" James said. ""We all saw it in the locker room.  &gt;""You know, like I said, as a competitor, I love going against Draymond, and I'm all about going out there and leaving it out on the floor. But when it gets a little bit more than what it should be, that's what caused me to have words with him.""  "
"I grew up watching Jordan.  I watched my first NBA finals in 1991 when I was 7.  Watched every game of every NBA Finals from 1991-1998.  Watched Jordan all through the playoffs of each year and caught his highlights on ESPN during the regular season when I didn’t get to see all his games.  I was obsessed.  And I still watch the NBA in this fashion.  Every year.  I’m so sick. And. Tired. Of the fking jordan versus LeBron debate.  Jordan was absolutely great.  WE GET IT.  Watching Jordan was incredible.  I actually stopped watching the NBA from 1998 (when Jordan retired, because it got boring after he retired) until 2003 when LeBron got drafted.  Instead of arguing WHO IS GREATER why can’t we just appreciate greatness in its current form:  LeBron james.  So tired of the Skip Baylesses of the world.  Jesus Christ.  Greatness takes many forms.  LeBron is great in so many different ways than Jordan.  Jordan actually seems 1-dimensional in comparison to LeBron, honestly.  LeBron has handled greatness in the social media age like an absolute pro.  That in and of itself is a great accomplishment.  Edit : If you want to argue greatness.. Jordan barely had any competition in the 90s.  LeBron beat a 73-win Warriors squad in 7 games in 2016.  Jordan never did anything as such.  He was the Warriors before the Warriors  LeBron will be gone sooner than you realize and only at this point will people start to realize how much they miss him.  Appreciate him while he’s around and stop with the Jordan vs LeBron argument.  The NBA will lose a lot of viewers when LeBron retires just as it did in 1998 when Jordan retired.  He carries the league just as Jordan did and Kobe didn’t."
"Skip: ""I have 2 words for you, Scary Terry. Terry Rozier is everything LeBron isn't, and by isnt I mean a closer. LeBron *is not* a closer! He just doesn't have it in him! He just doesn't want it at the end of games. He gets the  ball and just hot potatoes it to the closest person. When I see Terry Rozier, I see ferociousness, I see clutch, I see dominance, I see a taper fade, I see a winner.   I'm telling you whoever makes the decision to take LeBron James for 12 years over Terry Rozier should be put on the stand and shamed for this oversight. This is similar to hakeem and bowie being taken over Jordan. This is just a can't miss prospect. You just don't pass up on a Terry Rozier."""
"Well, I gotta disagree here. Dirk had a monster team compared to current Cavs - he had Tyson Chandler, Kidd, Marion, Terry and Stojakovic. All these guys were at least good role players. And the Heat were basically big 3 + garbage that year, nowhere near these Warriors. They [were the favorites](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2011/5/31/2198658/nba-finals-2011-odds-miami-heat-dallas-mavericks), but not even close to [this year's situation](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-finals-2018-warriors-open-as-massive-favorites-vs-lebron-james-cavaliers-according-to-vegas-oddsmakers/)"
One thing i see in this sub is that they only complain when it helps Warriors. I hardly see the same against cavs. Plus i doubt the sub in general would care if cavs (LeBron James) go 20 stright finals. Warriors going 4 and they think its stupid and rig.

Yes I agree. LeBron James is a Dynasty. 
James Harden doesn't have the same clout with the Rockets as LeBron does with the Cavs
"Actually, I don't think there's any way to realistically finagle the cap space for Lebron to sign w/out moving one of the Wiz' big three. The Wiz are way over the cap next season, and unless they do a sign-and-trade with Cleveland, I don't see it happening. Sadly...  But... damn yeah a starting five of Wall/Beal/Porter/James/Morris and bench depth of Oubre/Satoransky/Gortat is pretty damn solid. A much, much better team than whatever Cleveland would be able to put out next year, and importantly for the King they're probably good and young enough for repeat Finals trips for a few more years."
"Show me something to back up that LeBron petitioned the league to review the call.  This is all I could find:  &gt;""I don't know what should happen. It's not my call. That's the league office. They'll take a look at it,"" James said. ""We all saw it in the locker room.  &gt;""You know, like I said, as a competitor, I love going against Draymond, and I'm all about going out there and leaving it out on the floor. But when it gets a little bit more than what it should be, that's what caused me to have words with him.""  The rest of my post was a response to this: &gt;Draymond being suspended for one game set the league up the way it is more than any other individual action.  Which is just a ridiculously pathetic take on the Warriors 2016 collapse and the subsequent acquisition of KD. "

"You’re comparing a role player in Robert Horry to a person who was most definitely NOT a role player for their team in Bill Russell. When you compare alpha dogs, you gotta look at em in the same light. Comparing Russell to Kareem, MJ, and LeBron is totally fair, like comparing Horry to James Jones or Kyle Korver or whoever. "
"I know that I should want to get to the promised land with the guys who got us this far.....  But I would cry tears of joy if I got to see Wall, Beal, and LEBRON JAMES walk out onto the court together.*   *as members of the Washington Wizards, before one of you clowns make a joke about them all teaming up elsewhere and before I get super in my feelings about my fear of that happening..."
Embiid has really only had one chance and he was the only guy who played well on the Sixers against the Celtics. Yes he couldn't put the last ball in but he *was* fouled. I don't think it's fair to consider him not dependable just because of one play. If you're talking about Injury then Kyrie isn't exactly Lebron James. 
"      MIAMI GETS:          LeBron James, who signs a 6-year, $110 million contract      CLEVELAND GETS:          Two first-round picks, that must be used starting in 2013 and ending by 2017         2012 second-round pick Miami received from New Orleans         Future second-round pick Heat acquired from Oklahoma City         Cleveland can also swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012         A large trade exception($15 million or so) that the Cavs must use in trades for one calendar year.  And I am thinking clearly.  I have more respect for a player that fulfills their contractual obligation and then makes a move more than a player that threatens to be traded (or down right gets traded a la Kyrie Iving) whilst still under said contractual obligations.  Everyone has their point of view, that's mine and I know yours."

"Man... they'd be freaking awful.  We're talking about a team that was 29th in defensive rating this past year who only had an elite offense because of lebron. This team would've been a lottery team without lebron james. A team this bad on defense has never made the finals until now because of the greatness of lebron james.  If lebron leaves, this team will go from 4th in the east to 12th-14th just as they did when lebron left the first time.   "

"At the time I was living in Utah(I’m white), and I develeoped a friendship with my plumber(also white) from a small family run local business, Stockton and Sons.  John (he insisted from the start I always refer to him by his first name) and I had a relationship that blossomed as soon as we started to talk basketball. Although it sounds unbelievable today, white people did indeed like basketball before ESPN told us to starting in the early 2000’s.  I can’t remember how it came up exactly, but somehow I found that even though he was a plumber by day, John played for the local Mormon Church team, the Utah Jazz (named as such for the music of choice Mormon men play while having group sex with their multiple wives)  Now, a quick history lesson here, until the early 2000’s, almost the entirety of the NBA was made up of plumbers, janitors, electricians etc. Only at the turn of the millenium did team head scouts start drawing from proper talent pools and black communities in general. There were however, a few players that were dedicated basketball professionals that took full advantage of this lack of talent to inflate their stats and dominate the game.  Chief among them?  Michael Jordan  Anyways, John once offered me sideline tickets to an NBA finals game between our humble Jazz players(and Karl Malone) and the Chicago Bulls. I had a seat right behind the Bulls bench, and sat behind HVAC specialist and 3 pt sharpshooter Steve Kerr. Throughout the game Steve answered a ton of questions about my central heating so that was really great, but the real treat was watching him sit on the bench.  A quick aside. I’m not sure a lot of people know this, but Steve Kerr used to literally practice sitting on the bench. He would spend hours in the practice facility just sitting. True dedication to his volunteer job.  But what of Jordan you may be asking? Well it all comes full circle. In the 3rd quarter, Mike came storming up the court, the plumbers and garbagemen no match for his speed. He blitzed by Malone, and left the air as he rocketed towards the hoop. A dunk was to be made, but John was caught in between MJ and the 1990’s era 7 foot regulation rim.  The sight wasn’t pretty, but at least it was over quick. John lay motionless on the floor after being posterized. His small frail white body no match for a professional athlete. As he gathered himself and made his way over to the bench, MJ yelled “I hope I paralyze you next time!”  John reached for a Gatorade, for he earned the electrolytes, but Mike snatched it out of his hand, and without even drinking any lemon lime, threw the bottle(they were glass at the time) into the crowd.  I turned, tried to warn a young fan in its path, but I was too late. The bottle knocked the poor boy out cold, he must’ve been no more than 12 or 13. I ran to help this boy, and this boy’s name?  LeBron James. "
That arguably helped his career. I don't want to live in a world where a 33 year old LeBron James isn't capable of posting up smaller players.
"The players also think harden  (and Rose,  and Westbrook,  and Durant,  and curry, and Kawhi in the past) are more valuable players than LeBron James.."

"Be serious, the Celtics LeBron...and KD is on pace to win his second consecutive Finals MVP over Prince James "
"The difference is we don’t have LeBron James on a contract year to please. If the Cavs don’t make that move it just makes LeBron leaving that much more likely, and that is obviously the worst case scenario for them."
From before Lebron joined the Heat? Dwyane Wade/Joel Anthony/Udonis Haslem/James Jones/Mario Chalmers/Carlos Arrayo/Jamaal Magoire. What's your point?
"Why do we have to do anything with Kyrie?   https://kingjamesgospel.com/2018/02/16/kyrie-irving-believes-reunion-lebron-james-possible/  We all just assume he wanted to get away from LeBron, but are we sure he didn't just want to get out of a bad Cleveland situation?"
If you give LeBron the benefit of the doubt and take away all 6 finals losses and don't give Jordan credit for going undefeated and count MJs wizard years you are left with Jordan winning a title 40% of his seasons played and James 20%.  For LeBron to tie Jordan he would have to win the next 5 titles in a row
"Not only this, people forget. KD was on the Thunder team who went up against I think it was the Lebron Miami team 4 to 1 in the finals. Got fucking destroyed. KD saw Lebron forming super teams and realized that OKC was no super team, even though theey went up 3-1 against the Warriors. Doesn't matter. KD sees what Lebron has kept doing, sees what the Warriors are, sees what he has to do, then goes and does it. Its just that Lebron is the ""GOAT"" and everybody dickrides. People cant be honest to themselves about this situation. If KD went to Cavs instead of the Warriors, everybody would love him.  Because everybody fucking loves Lebron James for some reason, really I have no idea why honestly. "
"In some ways Lebron wanted the Cakewalk though. Lebron James literally recruited all star players to join him in both Miami and Cleveland. On his return, Cleveland traded a highly prospective first round draft pick in Wiggins for Lebron’s recruitment strategy. Lebron James got a great coach fired after half a season even though they were first in the league.  And Lebron has never left the East. While KD is on a much better team....it’s not like the Warriors team play in the East.  "
Breaking: Kyrie to have nasal surgery everyday to stay away from Lebron James!
"Are you okay? Take it down a notch.   They would have $33 million in cap flexibility without LeBron on the roster. I think that buys you a little more than the ""average"" small forward. That could get them Paul George, at the very least.   You're talking about Kevin Love like he's absolute garbage. The man *averaged* 20/15 for an *entire season* when he was just 22 years old and is now older, still in the midst of his prime. He was also in the west, where making the playoffs is a much more difficult feat than doing it in the east. This team would also no longer be playing ""LeBall"" where LeBron controls the ball *every single possession* and dribbles out the clock and drives and if that isn't open just kick it out to whatever player has now been relegated strictly to the role of spot up shooter. Ball movement and team play can do wonders for a lot of players in this league. I.e the Celtics making something out of the ""nothing"" that was their roster.   I literally never said that LeBron James won't make your team 8 wins better. Point out to me where I said that please. No need to take huge logical jumps and take it so personally. I just think with $33 million in cap space, they could acquire a player/build a team that would make the playoffs in the weaker conference. "
"I think lebron is overrated. They were introducing him as the goat last night. Lebron james is not the greatest of all time. That's bullshit. His career is evidence. In a situation like this getting swept as compared to what the rockets could pull off. All time great player? Of course. GOAT? Fuc no. At the very least the fact that the media says this to us is an indicator of their narrative for him, I haven't seen any player ever be introduced as the goat before that shit had me rolling lol. "

SWEEP!!  They already won it in Oakland but they never swept Lebron James before.
"So the top player is getting these one year contracts to go play with stars and just chooses the team with the most of them every year? Even LeBron returning to Cleveland still got a three year that only let him opt out after year 2 right?   &gt;Well these people must have been born yesterday because not a single person felt that way when it was happening.  There are **a lot** of newer fans, some who are just simply LeBron James fans, who look back on the Heat and just compare the star level to the Warriors star level and think that LeBron was just a guy who happened to have a couple all-stars on his team."

Your asking if LeBron James son is the same person as Lebron?
Want an even more unpopular take?  LeBron James (our sub’s lord and savior) quite possibly would have done the same as KD (our sub’s devil) in his position.
I mean not really excuses.  They have Lebron James who is currently the greatest player on the planet.  Without him that team blows. The only 2 teams you listed that could beat Cleveland were Toronto and Boston.  Boston came damn close but were missing 2 important roster pieces.  Toronto basically has 2 players and they both seem to choke every year.

I too have not seen LeBron James play in six years.
"LeBron can’t guard KD. If Lebron stays on Durant it’s not gonna change anything, KD averaged 30 on him in the finals with the Thunder, 35 last year,  and probably gonna be around 33 this year.

Curry plays a different game to Lebron. Lebron plays extremely physically he is naturally going to get more calls then Curry because of how he places him self. Lebron a lot of time gets no calls because he can physically play through calls and fouls unlike James Floppen.

"Every round of this year's playoffs has been far from boring though. The Rockets took the Warriors to seven games (and very well might have won if Chris Paul's hamstring had held together), while the Celtics took the Cavs to 7 games in the Eastern Conference).  Everyone gets on the Warriors for seemingly never facing any adversity and stomping through the postseason, when:   -They came back from being down 3-1 to beat the Thunder in 2016  -Lost to the Cavs after going up 3-1   -Got taken to the brink of elimination *just this season* by the Rockets  -Will only now win their first consecutive Championship assuming everything goes the way it looks like it'll go.   Additionally, I hardly think it's the Warriors' fault that the best the Eastern Conference could muster to face them is Lebron James and the worst supporting cast ever assembled around him (that he hand-picked himself after running Kyrie out of town).

"No he’s not. LeBron doesn’t take half his shots from behind the arc, doesn’t have a historic free throw rate and he operates in the mid post very often. To acquire James you’d have to lose shooting as well."
Lebron James is a bum 
"Almost the entire 08 rotation for Boston was signed the summer of 07. The only players acquired through trades were KG and Ray allen as sign and trades because they were about to walk. Rondo, perk, pp and big baby were homegrown. Eddie house, cassell, and james posey were all acquired in FA.   08's celtics were built almost exactly like the 10 heat were. Haslem, wade, chalmers and james jones were ""homegrown"" as well. The only reason we view those two summers any different/high profile is because Lebron. "
"The way that some people talk about the Cavs it's as if they're a garbage team that is lucky to be there. It brings down all the competition the Cavs faced in the East and brings down the Warriors. As if the Warriors would have close games if it was just Lebron James playing by himself.  James is a great player, one of the best, and a HOF. Yet we're acting as if his team is garbage. If the Cavs replaced Lebron with another good player the Cavs would probably still go to the the playoffs in the East. It's not like they would be picking first every year in the draft. "
"Lebron James is on more PEDs than MLB in the 90s, and once this comes out, his career will be invalidated."
"They didnt respond to what you said because KD is not better than LeBron James. Posting that in a serious discussion thread probably looks like you're overreacting and not being serious.  Not hating, I'm just explaining their thought process."
Have you heard of LeBron James?
"Yeah, he was loosing passes down low games 1 and 2. Javale is playing his damn ass off. Anything they want him to do he does it. He guarded Lebron for a possession last night.  If I told someone 2-3 years ago that Javale would be guarding Lebron James in the NBA finals going for back to back titles they would have had me committed!"
"So you think Lebron isn't worth 8 wins?    I find it fucking insane that you think taking away Lebron won't affect this team by 8 wins.    Lebron played all 82 games, played 37 fucking minutes a game, and averaged 27.5 points on 54% shooting with 8.6 rebounds and 9 assists.  The Cavs won 50 games with that man.  You are telling me that replacing him with a league average small forward will result in a team that wins more than 42 games?  Get the fuck out of here.    Really - you think a team with Kevin Love as its best player - the same Kevin Love who never made the playoffs in Minny is going to win 43 games?  Keep in mind, Love missed 20 games, which means for 20 games your top offensive options are going to be JR Smith, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green and whatever league average SF they replace Bron with.  Also none of these people will play defense.  Seriously - look at that fucking roster without Lebron.  They will be a zero on defense and will struggle to score - they won't be better than the Hornets, or the Pistons, or maybe even the Knicks.  Just take Jeff Green as an example of this team.  He averaged 11 points on 47% shooting this year.  Last year he played for Orlando, and averaged 9 points on 39% shooting.  He played about the same minutes and about the same number of games.  He played for Orlando because literally no one wants him because he's trash.  Cleveland is his 5th team in 5 years, and this year he shot his highest percentage since 2010-11.  There was a mini Jeff Green renaissance this year - what do you think Jeff Green is going to do next year?    Again, you are saying Lebron James won't make your team 8 wins better.  And I'm the fucking crazy one?   "
"I would have given Cleveland a much better chance against Houston. James Harden does appear to run hot and cold regarding his confidence, so there's a *chance* LeBron could have gotten into his (or the refs') head. But probably not. I would have picked Houston 4-2."
"Yes. But KG is the piece that made them favorites to win a ring, and they only got KG because he agreed to an extension if they traded for him, and he only agreed to it because he wanted to play for them (bc they had Pierce and Allen).  The equivalent is kind of Chris Paul going to the Rockets because they already have James Harden, KD going to the Warriors because they had Steph and Klay, or LeBron going to the Cavs because they had Kyrie and a way to get Kevin Love.  Sure, the front office had to put them in that position to get that piece, but the star player dictated where he went. "
"Because the Cavaliers system isn't based on coaching, but LeBron James. He is the one whos set up the team to work around him. "
"Yeah what a gamble. Nobody could’ve guessed that Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, and Chris Bosh would’ve made a dominant team. It’s not like the East just finished being run by a lesser Big 3 or anything."

The Lakers are twice as likely to win the championship as the Spurs next season. Vegas is measuring LeBron James against the current rosters. 
"LeBron was also destined to become 6’8 with legendary athleticism and was surrounded by basketball at an early age.  Maybe you’d have a point if James wasn’t immediately recognized for his basketball (and later football) talent and glorified very early by coaches, peers who looked out for him. They protected him in ways his mother could not.  You see more rags to riches success stories in sports than from those who grow up with a “silver spoon” for good reason. Economic background isn’t much of a factor in sports because talent is talent and you’ll be recognized if you have it. James absolutely was.   Curry wasn’t born with hand eye coordination, that’s stupid. His father didn’t have close to his ability."
"Yeah, because again, the random choice of teammate was somehow “Scottie Pippen” where suddenly defense is the most critical component of evaluating a player so as to denigrate Kevin Love, but in all other cases, defense isn’t even brought up.  And those two teammates have, obviously, nothing to do with Michael Jordan or LeBron James, so we’re not allowed to compare the two on defensive metrics.  And all of the utterly cherry picked arguments above coincidentally make LeBron look better.  Like again, give me a break."

Total pussy, amirite."
I’m a simple man. I love Sam Hinkie and I love Lebron James 
"James' basketball strategy and media strategy is one and the same.   If the team is all about Lebron, then the narrative is how much he does for the team and how indispensable he is - and since he handles the ball 90% of the game and chooses when to shoot, he racks up huge counting stats and can control his efficiency. And then you can point to the consistent triple-doubles, and the points, and the efficiency, and use the weight of (somewhat manipulated) numbers to judge him as a player.  You could potentially make the team's strategy not ""Lebron all the time"", but then you run into resistance, because it doesn't fit James' narrative plan. It's clearly the case that the decision has been made (no pun intended) to lose by giving James a Herculean load rather than gamble and potentially win by running something more traditional. In those rare moments where Cleveland is in dire straits and needs to run something more complex, they're very hit-or-miss, because they have so little experience working as a team - all they have is occasional Hill PnR, and that old Love-Korver two-man game. "

I respect his greatness, but LeBrons basketball career as of late is so cringeworthy to follow as of late.. he's running a cooperate diva  like career. It makes SO much sense why he won't consider San Antonio even though it's probably the best fucking option for him on paper.. he won't be able to control the narrative, and seeing him act like a spoiled lil bitch just wants me to enjoy watching him come up short. He's just gonna up and leave everybody like love and korver who stuck around to fulfill his legacy and made great sacrifices to their game and reputation, because he can't fucking win? He's the most piece of shit selfish asshole for not taking a pay cut for at least one year.. he's LeBron James one pay cut would absolutely not hurt. He only knows sacrifice when it's at the detriment of others. He could learn a lot from the players on the warriors"
"&gt; He left the thunder, which had Westbrook, a top 5PG and overall top 15 or 10 player in the league, and James harden.   &gt; I don't think he ever had an all-star teammate in that time, but kd had Russell Westbrook and James harden! This guy literally was on a team with 3 mvp players and they couldn't win or come close in the finals with the that squad.   Jesus Christ. Did you just start watching the NBA yesterday? The team of KD, Westbrook, Harden and Ibaka made the finals and only lost to  primed Lebron, Wade and Bosh. It was the Thunder who decided to blow up that team instead of just paying Harden/Ibaka what they deserved.  None of you people whining about KD can even recall what happened a few seasons ago yet you seem to know for sure what KD's legacy will be years from now. I find that incredible."
"But the 2010 Cavs were the 2009 Cavs minus James. It proves the point that yes, LeBron is really the reason this team is not in the lottery.   Reddit is acting like this is a Durant in OKC situation. It is not. The Cavs, outside of LeBron, is terrible. "
"As he rose up from his locker just now, LeBron James spotted the world's leading LeBron-ologist @WindhorstESPN studying his walk to see how well he was moving. ""Looking to see if I'm limping?"" James asked Windy with a smile. ""Even if I was I wouldn't show you."""
"So this isn't really that relevant and will probably get (rightly so) downvoted here, but this doesn't deserve its own thread so I'll just casually mention it here.  Does anyone else really dislike the current state of the NBA with offenses like Cleveland and Houston and even Golden State at times where they're so focused around one player?  Now Golden State obviously isn't the worst offender here, they only seem to run it when KD or Steph is hot, but I think it makes the games a lot more boring to watch.   I personally just don't think it's that fun to watch Lebron or Harden get a high screen to switch onto a not-good defender and then drive at them almost every possession. It's smart basketball, but it's really boring to be honest, and what is basketball if not entertainment.  I also particularly don't like offensive scheme mixed with LeBron's and Harden's playstyles to be honest. And about LeBron, he is incredible, he might be the greatest ever as a matter of fact, but I have a hard time putting him above guys like Kobe and Mike because a lot of LeBron's success comes from more of a place of elite athleticism and body rather than true basketball skill.  Like, when I watch LeBron James drive at the rim and use his strength to overpower a smaller defender (often using his off arm liberally, but often not as well) to lay the ball in easily, I just don't get the same feeling I got when watching Kobe Bryant hit turnaround fadeaways from 26 feet with elite defenders sweaty fingers covering his eyes.  This post became a total rant that got off track quickly so I'll stop it here, but maybe one person will see this and be able to relate to it. "
Ridiculing is warranted. The bullying is a bit much. He literally makes his money off speculating about Lebron James and telling false information non stop about him. Hes like a Lebron-only version of Stephen A Smith.
"I don’t get why Dubs fans are acting like Curry is the only guy who gets defended aggressively. Literally every player on the court has recent scratches all over them. Durant’s huge scratch stood out in the broadcast as well. There was a mention in the Hoop Collective the other day about LeBron taking a beating this series and playoffs. Much like this report, one of the guys said he saw LeBron sitting in the locker with cuts and scrapes and blood everywhere as well. I didn’t see a single post about it. No one cares. You’re a professional basketball and it’s the playoffs. If Curry were to get every single bump and swipe then James should also get 20 free throws a game for every drive he takes. And what a boring game that would be."
How’s a lebron James team getting to the finals evidence of a super team. This is his fourth with the cavs. Are we watching a super team right now? They promised 7 and only got two. Why? Because it wasn’t a super team. At no point from 2010-2014 we’re wade and bosh close to steph and KD. They’d be closer to dray and Thompson if anything.

"23 out of the possible 56 teams have had 4 HOFs or more.    Teams with 4 HOFs or more facing teams with 3 or less are 10-4 in that time.    4 times have both contending teams have had at least 4 HOFs. These numbers aren’t included in the second stat.   I would argue that parity and dynasties don’t go hand in hand. And although there have only been a couple dynasties according to the win/loss column, so many of these teams in this list have been as dominant at their time, if not more, than the Warriors are now.

David Griffin! And as his first move as GM would bring in LeBron James. 
"On the flip side you could say that same thing about the Cavs. There were multiple occasions when Lebron was getting easy switches onto Curry. The difference was, when Durant got switches on players like George Hill, he was playing in a position where he could keep the switch to his advantage (IE - getting the shot over him in the high post where the double team was ineffective). When Lebron got his switches, he would try to impose his physical advantage on Curry and drive to the lane where the doubles came and forced the ball out of James hands. The Warriors played the mismatch better than the Cavs did.  [Example 1](https://youtu.be/fLS5Ey5r9D0?t=259)  [Example 2](https://youtu.be/fLS5Ey5r9D0?t=417)  [Example 3](https://youtu.be/fLS5Ey5r9D0?t=473)  Can only find highlights obviously but I can remember more than one occasion of James driving on Steph but was forced to give the ball up to a player the Warriors would rather have taking the shot."
Breaking: Sixers name Lebron James new GM  /s
LeBron James had retired and joined the Sixers as GM.
Not sure what the protections were but they were absolutely desperate for a center at the time and everyone knew it. Mozgov and TT were literally their only bigs in the 2015 finals. If they didn’t have him they would’ve had to put LeBron at center with James Jones at PF for significant minutes 
The Cavs have a guy named LeBron James.
"""The Philadelphia 76ers are expected to announce their new General Manager, Lebron James, on Monday."""
"Basketball = 5 players on the court, playing both offense and defense   Soccer/futball = 11 players, offense and defense responsibilities are generally split  As incredible as Messi or Ronaldo are, they have less influence on the game than Lebron James. Just a function of the rules of the sport. That's why people weigh team success more heavily when evaluating a player's legacy in basketball.  It's not necessarily fair, but that's how it is."
"Imagine this:  LeBron James signs with Philly.  At his press conference, the topic of BC comes up (of course) and he says “thank god he’s gone, I never would have come here if he was still in charge”.  I think Bill Simmons would actually kill himself during his next podcast. "
[Woj]: The Philadelphia 76ers and Lebron James have agreed to start Waze.  Lebron driving around Cleveland begging [through text] for address to 76ers headqaurters.
"&gt; The Cavs also put themselves in salary cap hell with the JR Smith and Tristan Thompson deals.  You can thank Lebron James for that.   &gt; The Warriors would have been in the exact same position with Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut if not for KD coming that same offseason.  Quite likely, yes.   &gt; As fans we were robbed of what could have been some of the most exciting playoff basketball in nba history between the Steph-Klay-Dray Warriors, KD-Russ Thunder, Harden-CP3 Rockets and LeBron's Cavs these last couple years.   Lol no you werent. You're just mad that the team you don't want to win, is winning in spades. Every single one of those teams would try to get better by acquiring better players, they're not going to stay the same for the sake of equal parity and entertainment. Harden-CP3 rockets are one year in the making. Lebrons Cavs had Kyrie, and then Lebron ran Kyrie out of town. Lebron normalized superstars joining up and taking paycuts to win championships, now he's on the other side of the coin. Which is exactly why he's going to leave Cleveland for the most stacked team that can afford him. Again. People are complaining about the Cavs getting handled easily, but the Cavs aren't even the second best team in the league, so it's a moot point. "
"Future Sixer LeBron James yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter JJ Redick gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard TJ McConnell yelled out, “We got [expletive] small collars now.” And before Embiid hit the locker room door, former Sixers GM Sam Hinkie hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Wait what. I can literally pull up stats where Jordan... okay I'll do it.  1998 Finals - Game 6 Jordan plays 44 minutes. Scores 45 of his team's 87 points and hits the game winner. Only one other player had double digits (15) and Pippen only had 8 points.  They were playing the NBA's all time leader in assists and steals, the number 2 ALL TIME SCORER (MVP), the 3 point champ, and a HOF coach.  If that was Lebron James... Do they win that game? Or that series? Think about that."
And in his place bring on LeBron James.

Lebron James is my 2nd favorite Nba team because he's a top 3 player of all time and plays like a one man army. 
"Damian Lillard.  In a sea of great point gaurds he’s been a great player, but is regularly unrecognized.  I don’t see the Trailblazers making a finals with him and unless he or the team makes changes he will be largely forgotten.    Blake Griffin. People are already forgetting he was once a top 5 player for a short period in time. Now he’s on a Detroit team with spacing issues that rarely gets mentioned outside of jokes and game of zones mentions.  Missing the playoffs in the east is going to hurt his legacy.   Dwight Howard.  He’s becoming more known for his exits from teams than his dominance as the best Center in the league for a decade.  Few remember the guy who dominated the 2009 playoffs and dragged a team of role players to the finals.  Most remember the backstabbing in Orlando, the stay campaign in LA, the refusal of Houston to re-sign him, and the trade from Atlanta.    Carmelo Anthony:  He was at his best in Denver under Goerge Karl.  There was a time when he was seen the same way we look at Durant.  I firmly believe that if he stayed in Denver for one more year and teamed up with Wade and Lebron in Miami he would have two or three rings.  As it stands he has zero.  He has always been iso focused, but stopped trusting teammates entirely when he went to New York.  Now he will be remembered more as a one way player with constant injury issues than one of the greatest offensive superstars of his generation.    Klay Thompson:  On a team full of superstars it’s easy to forget he’s a star himself.  Durant, Steph, and Draymond all have defined roles.  Durant has taken much of the role Klay used to have on the team and while he’s still great, his impact has become less pronounced.  He’s on the same level as Paul Goerge at this stage of their careers, but has been willing to sacrifice for his team much like Gail Goodrich, James Worthy, Dennis Johnson, and Chris Bosh had in the past.  If he steps on another team that can showcase his talent the narrative of top ten shooting gaurds will change very quickly in a way similar to how we view James Harden."

Paul Pierce dagger 3 over LeBron James in game 5 of the 2012 ECF  please don’t remind me of what happened the rest of that series
We're talking about one of the best defensive players to ever play basketball. The most versatile post player to ever play. Do we fault LeBron James for shitty management and lack of players? Because that's exactly what happened to Hakeem after Sampson went down. He can't be blamed for that. 
"I gotta say, I am pretty impressed that you are such a hater that you spent an hour writing fan-fic about imaginary situations where professional basketball players have no agency and are incapable of playing basketball unless LeBron exerts 110% on both offense and defense.     The Cavs supporting cast are garbage defensively, and were so long before they played with LeBron.  Here are the players on the Cavs who are net negative defenders for their career (whose teams have been better defensively with them off the court):  JR Smith  Kevin Love   Kyle Korver   Rodney Hood   Jeff Green   Jordan Clarkson (with a whopping -2.2 career DBPM)   Jose Calderon (also with a whopping -2.2 career DBPM)    The only career positive defenders on the Cavs are Larry Nance (+1.8)   Tristan Thompson (+0.2)    George Hill (+0.2), who actually played better defense on the Cavs than he did on his previous team earlier in the year.     LeBron James (+3.5)     That isn't a LeBron problem, that is a front office problem.  They assembled a historically shitty team of defenders, how the fuck could anyone be stupid enough to think that they would be able to stop the offensive juggernauts coming out of GSW or Houston?    For context, there is only *one* player on GSW who got significant minutes and is a career net negative defender, Nick Young.   The 11th best defender on the Warriors is better than the 3rd best defender on the Cavs.    Also, none of your fan-fic explains why all those players who have significant history playing with LeBron (who plays the same style of ball he has always played) mysteriously forgot how to play basketball (like Korver, JR and Love).     All of your complaints about coaching, not LeBron.   It is also particularly ironic that you use hockey assists specifically as a complaint, as it clearly demonstrates that you are crafting a narrative that fits your priors rather than evaluating the situation honestly.  If you actually look at the stats (https://stats.nba.com/players/passing/?sort=SECONDARY_AST&amp;dir=1) LeBron *led the playoffs* in hockey assists.  His hockey assist rate was almost double that of Rondo, Simmons and CP3, and over double that of Harden and Wall.      He also has the second biggest differential between potential assists and actual assists in the playoffs (9 assists per game, 19 potential assists to players in good scoring position) because his team was building the great wall of Cleveland with all those bricks.   For example, Rondo's teammate converted on 62% of the scoring opportunities he setup, LeBro's.... 47%.    He also has the fourth highest adjusted assist to pass ratio (17.3%) of any starter in the playoffs (behind only Harden, Rondo, Wall).  So even with the Cavs laying bricks, he was still  *very* effective in creating scoring chances for his teammates.   TL/DR; The evidence proves your creative writing exercise isn't based upon reality.  "
"Shit the bed?  He did what he's literally done every game of his entire career.   He pounded the rock, took everyone off the dribble, and shot damn near every time.

He didn't shit the bed. He was Jordan Clarkson."

"Tim Duncan, Boris Diaw, Dirk Nowitzki, Charles Barkley, Kevin Garnett, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh are just a handful of players that have been used just like Draymond, way before Draymond. His skill set on offense is not new, so I don't see how you can keep arguing that it's Dray who will be influential. He's just riding off the influence of decades of point forwards who came before him. It sounds like you didn't watch basketball pre-Draymond and don't realize that he's far from the first to play this way.  The only thing that is somewhat unique to Draymond is how often he gets a 4 v 3 on the pick and roll to facilitate off of. This has *nothing* to do with Dray's skill-set. It's actually, funnily enough, because of Steph Curry. Curry gets trapped extra aggressively off high pick and rolls because of how deadly of a shooter he is, leaving Draymond with a clear 4 v 3 on the short roll. So the part of Dray's game that you perceive as most unique is almost exclusively because of Steph Curry. And even that part of his game is going away because teams are switching instead of trapping now."

Shaq whips you down, then dunks you through the basket.  &gt; ""For the time (Chamberlain) played, Wilt was bigger, stronger and quicker than every player who was near his size.

Step 3: ""The Cavs would surely want a couple of future first-rounders for their trouble, after getting two of them, plus a swap option and two second-round picks, for signing-and-trading James to the Miami Heat in 2010 -- a move that did not force Cleveland to take on any salary in return."""

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.   People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.   The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.   And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.   Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.   So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.   You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.   This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair? "

That's my reasoning. For anyone who isn't a believer, or a skeptic because he played in the 60's, just watch videos on him from TheWiltChamberlainArchive channel on YouTube and watch his one-on-one matches with Kareem, who is a serious contender for GOAT.

"&gt;No, the distinction is that LeBron James used to have a chance to win the championship  Don't know who you are arguing with.

If iguodala was healthy, the series goes 5 games, with or without Chris Paul. Furthermore, even with Chris Paul, the Rockets were blown out in both Games 1 and 3 due to the Warriors 3rd Quarter surge. Chris Paul being injured did not make the Rockets miss 27 straight threes.   &gt;OKC vs Golden State as witnessed in the 2016 playoffs when 67 win SA was no match for OKC  Which, a) ignores the fact that the Thunder *should* have won the series - it wasn't simply a competitive series. Through 4 games, the Warriors looked completely outmatched, and b) The Spurs were not ""no match"". That is patently false. They were up 2-1. The Spurs were actually up 4 points going into the 4 quarter of Game 4, and only truly looked like ""no match"" in Game 6 where they were down wire-to-wire. "

"&gt;The distinction is that with Lebron and the East, at least the winner of the Eastern Conference Playoffs has a chance to win the championship.     No, the distinction is that LeBron James used to have a chance to win the championship. Because nobody has seriously challenged his team when healthy outside of this past year, which was the result of an aging roster and Kyrie being traded. And as a result of being challenged, he's switching teams to stack the deck for the 3rd time in a decade. Meanwhile the West was an absolute bloodbath, the end of which has caused the supposed outrage over KD (ignoring the fact that Houston almost beat the KD Warriors this year). Not to mention that this supposed competition in the West he ended was actually simply OKC vs Golden State as witnessed in the 2016 playoffs when 67 win SA was no match for OKC.  So the reality of the situation is that people, more specifically LeBron fans, got upset that James's chances of winning the 1 competitive series he saw every year were dramatically reduced.  "
"I'm speaking in a relative way.   Back then the PG talent was weak(Nash, Billups, Parker, and a couple others at best) so Telfair was hyped as changing the game along LeBron James. So him having 5 seasons on 3 teams and berely cracking 10 pts and 2-3 of everything else along with 7 seasons playing roughly 15 mins is greater than what is exoected of Lonzo, but far from the game changing hype he was.   http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Sebastian-Telfair-4558/  All Lonzo has to do is secure a 2 year contract and get the same stats as the later years fo Telfair to beat the hype around Liangelo.   So it's relative.  If game changing Telfair ends up getting good mins from portland and Minny based on he dribbling and passing skills then next to nothing the 7 other years, will it be as disapointing as liangelo the g league at best, getting any 2 way contracts or averaging 10 mins for one season in the NBA?."

"That was 4 games with no other reliable option except maybe McCollum who isn’t too special against 3 good defenders ganging up on him...

The only 2 assets worth anything in this deal are Lonzo (who Lillard is better than and would replace) and Kuzma who might not even start if the Lakers acquire LeBron and PG and then you’re also giving up a player worth negative value. I don’t see how that is too much, unless you want to build for the future while having a 33-year-old LeBron which would make no sense."
"If we scramble up his two first names, ""LeBron"" and ""Raymone"" then we can make the word *BLENNORRHOEA* which means an excessive discharge of watery mucus, especially from the urethra or the vagina. Now what team could this possible refer to, I hear you mumble to yourself aloud while checking both the anagram and definition.  I'll tell you what this means, I think you're already a step ahead of me. The Houston Rockets.   1. A ""snot rocket"" is a booger blast of hot *mucus*   2. Clint Capela has the longest and strongest *urethra* in the NBA   3. James Harden draws and *excessive* amount of fouls 4. Their 3's, when the do hit, make a metaphorically *watery* splash   5.

I was going bay the basis that Telfair was on the cover of SI along with LeBron James as changing the game  and spent his time being mostly 3rd string PG.   LiAngelon is believed to be playing abut definitely no more than a Role player but people say he will not make it at all.   So... Let's say Telfair was hyped as a 9 or 10 and wound up a 3-4.   Liangelo is billed as a 4-3 at best but our prediction is as a 0( as in' G league players would be 2 at best.

"Why don't teams in the East say LeBron James ruined the Eastern Conference? Prior to last year, his teams went 48-8 against the East in the playoffs from 2014-2017. Love didn't play in 2 of those losses, 1 of the L's was the fluke 4-28 game by Kyrie/Love, 1 of them was the fluke game where LeBron only played 20 minutes due to foul trouble vs Indiana in 2014 and Miami still only lost by 3, and 1 of them was the 20 point blown lead at home to an IT-less Celtics team in 2017.     So barring ridiculous circumstances that were in no way susbtainable, his team lost a total of 3 games in the East playoffs in 4 years. 4 years. Nobody said a word about him ruining the conference and nobody will care if he goes to Philly or Boston or somehow forms another superteam in Cleveland. If you want to say KD ruined the West, then that's a fine argument. But to say he ruined the NBA? That's a joke, because there's another player in the East that took care of that when he took his talents to South Beach.     And if anyone wants to talk about how hard it was for Cleveland to make it out of the East this year, you're proving my point. Because that's exactly why LeBron is leaving them for greener pastures. And the ""LeBron is good enough to win the East on his own"" is a moot point as well, they almost lost to an Indiana team that traded it's franchise player and was supposed to be rebuilding. They were taken to 7 by Boston and they were missing their 2 best players. And the only thing Toronto is good for in the playoffs is embarrassing themselves. Put a healthy Kyrie on this Cavs team in place of George Hill and they probably sweep the East again. And isn't one of the primary arguments for LeBron leaving the Cavs being the FO traded Kyrie behind his back?     So no team in the East has a right to complain about Durant ruining the NBA, because LeBron has stacked the deck against that Conference with multiple teams for the past decade. And whatever team LeBron is on can't complain either, because they did the same shit to the East that Golden State did to the West  "
"I mean, the team would have likely re-signed Barnes, Bogut, Ezeli, Speights, and Barbosa. McGee/Zaza/Young/West wouldn't have ringchased without KD. Not only is the starting lineup significantly worse with Barnes in place of KD, but so is the bench because Bogut/Ezeli aren't even in the league anymore and Speights is all but done.     And what teams were actually going to challenge the Warriors that KD ruined the NBA for? OKC? Sure, 100%. Also one of the NBA's smallest markets/fanbases. San Antonio? Couldn't even beat KD in OKC in 2016, but I guess? Also a tiny fanbase. Houston? The 8 seed in 2016? Seems like a stretch as Paul to Houston likely never even happens without KD to the Dubs, but ok. Who else? The East has been on lockdown for 8 years by 1 player that's jumped teams 3 times and will soon do it a fourth, yet noone bats an eye. Those East teams have no concern for the West because they can't beat LeBron anyway. So who did KD really ruin the NBA for? OKC, SA, Houston, and...LeBron James fans."
&gt;I am praising LBJs run as well.  Are you?  &gt; (unlike Kobes who blew a 1-3 lead against the Suns in the fcuking first round)  &gt; This is a reminder that Lebron James is the god damn King and Kobe... well he's really salty (that hes not even in the discussion for GOAT) and scared that LBJ might become a Laker (kobe's just sliding down that all time laker list).  Right...
"This is why the Cavs doubled Curry almost constantly. Unfortunately, they forgot how to play rotational defense at the same time to try to keep 2 guys on Durant when the ball came his way... If that was LeBron James with the ball, he'd get swarmed. But MJ? Nah just single coverage should be fine. Terrible defensive decision."

Point is, you can't just look at the names, that's a lazy and reductive way of looking at it. There's context to it all.

"Michael Jordan also had three years of college play to prepare himself and develop more fully. LeBron James' sophmore year of basketball (age 19, far younger than Jordan in rookie season) questionably exceeds Jordan's rookie stats, and LeBron's junior season definitely does. "
"If you are not sure, you could follow what 90 percent of this sub does. So here is what they do, they say they are a fan of a team but they are actually a fan of this guy named LeBron James. They just follow whatever team he goes to.  LeBron is in a thing called ""free agency"" right now which means he can pick which team he goes to next season. They say he is going to make his decision in the beginning of July, so you will have a better idea then what team to choose.   Hope this helps, and good luck!"

"Do you understand how the lottery works? That is the definition of luck, it’s literally random. Anyways, that’s not even the way I was using the word lucky. I was using it in the way that they were fortunate to have been in position to draft LeBron. The Cavs were lucky that they got to experience having LeBron James lead their team for years. They should be grateful, not burning his jersey. They could’ve just as easily got the 3rd pick and drafted Darko fucking Milic.  What does this have to do with Warriors fans? Stop man, just stop. Lol."
"Dude by your definition literally everything could be based on luck.    The Cavs literally tanked for Lebron James, its not like he was going to randomly come out that year. Again, tell me what your point is because i could spin literally anything that happens in this league to luck.  P.s. just because some warriors fans are circle jerking in this thread doesnt mean you make any sense."

The second pick was then used in a separate trade, ending up in Philadelphia and becoming [No. 24 Timothe Luwawu in the 2016 draft](http://www.nbadraft.net/nba_final_draft/2016)     - 2012 second-round pick Miami received from New Orleans - This pick would be used in a package with the No. 24 and No. 34 picks to acquire the [No. 17 Tyler Zeller](http://www.nbadraft.net/nba_final_draft/2012)  - Future second-round pick Heat acquired from Oklahoma City - This pick would become Milan Macvan - [Pick 54](http://www.nbadraft.net/nba_final_draft/2011)  - Cleveland can also swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012 - This pick was not swapped and became Dion Waiters, but since this pick wasn't obtained I don't count it as an asset gained.   - A large trade exception($15 million or so) that the Cavs must use in trades for one calendar year.

"I mean....is it wrong? If he values skills such as shooting ability, ball control, off ball movement, etc. You could make this argument. I understand LeBron is considered the best in the world and some think ever but it's firmly established guards are generally more skilled than forwards so why is it so alarming to believe one of the most skilled point guards ever has more skill than LeBron James who uses his skill in conjunction with his generational athleticism to be the player that he is?  Are we really acting like there is no argument to be had?"

Lebron and James Jones= proven chamionship combo
"So flash back to 2009. I’m an 11 year old boy with big boy dreams. My brother was into the nba at the time and since our parents lived in Chicago when we were born, he’s a bulls fan. I just go along with this and root for them when they are facing the Celtics in the playoffs first round. Good series but they lose and I’m ok with that cause I don’t really give a shit.  So after they lose I start actually caring about some nba stuff. I see Lebron James on the Cavs and it’s hate at first sight, there is no reason i hated him but immediately I just did. So what do I do? I root for the other guy people always talk about when they talk about Lebron, Kobe. It also helps that we lived in California for 7 years so I remember waiting for kings, lakers, and Oakland a’s games to go off so wrestling could start. So for the next few years I’m a lakers fan and gleefully watch on while Lebron James fails and my new fave Kobe is king.  Then the decision happens. I watch it intently and get ready to root against him. He chooses miami and I’m pumped and want to see Kobe fuck the heatles in the finals. Short story lakers get swept and I’m mad but dirk is a cool guy and I love watching him shut up arrogant dwade and Lebron. Well next year the heat go back and the lakers suck against the baby thunder who I hate so I’m not excited about the matchup. Heat wins, Lebron wins and I’m kind of burnt out of being so invested in the nba.  This leads to me not watching basketball for almost two years. I turn to video games and politics. This changes when I turn on warriors clippers game 6 by chance in 2014. I notice I love their colors and this small dude can shoot like shit. I think “cool.” Plus theyre from Cali so I’m kind of like, “I could root for them.” Well they lose and I stop watching after that game 7 except for game 5 of finals where I see spurs fuck Lebron for old times sake.  Cue me not watching for another year until I turn on the nba finals game 5 for shits and giggles. I have no idea who’s even playing until I see it’s the Cavs (didn’t know Lebron went back until turned on game) and that team with the white and yellow. I say fuck it and watch the game where that small guy goes bananas. “Cool, I guess he won mvp this year.” I watch them win the series and am kind of happy my nemesis Lebron loses again.  Cut to me not watching for another year until I hear the cool team with cool colors and the small guy could break the bulls wins record. “Cool.” I watch the last 10 or so games of the season and the playoffs. I root for them when Steph got hurt and when down 3-1. Felt great looking at YouTube comments of thunder fans since I was a young lad of 18.  Then the darkness came. I was pumped about my taco after game 4 but that was soon erased by the biggest choke in nba finals history. I was sad, broken, and beat down after that block. After the shot I had nightmares of uncle drew taking my ankles against my will. I was ready to step away from b-ball again to save myself the heartache of watching my new fave player Steph be mocked for choking.  Then, a light. A slightly green light reminiscent of the morning dew visible from the students chambers of house slytherin. That guy who was kind of a bitch in the thunder series joined the team I’d grown to like. “Cool.”  Cue me watching the season and rooting for golden state. The dominance was orgasm inducing. And Lebron lost too. Revenge. Then this season was cool too.  Now I have a Seattle flair cause I want to live there one day and like the yellow and green. It was a long journey, but i am now and will forever remain a slytherin fan"
"What you are experiencing is called ""recency bias"".  It is a condition the OP actually addresses.    Relax, have a beer if you're old enough and sit back and remember all the way back to 2014.  Golden State was no big deal, in fact they had fired their coach and many expected them to fall back from where they'd risen.  OKC was a top team.  Cleveland had not only had the #1 draft pick, but a guy named LeBron James had decided to grace the town with his presence again, a super highly sought Kevin Love had been convinced to join James and Kyrie Irving was a rising star.  OK.  Now that we've recalled that, we might recall that the Cavs had Golden State on the ropes in the Finals.  Those lucky Warriors were heading for an exit until a series of injuries made the path easier for them.  Post-Finals, the common refrain was that Cleveland was perhaps the better team in spite of the results.  Losing to Golden State was no shame, in fact it suggested great things to come.    Fast forward to now.  Terrible contract moves.  A total shit coach too gutless to actually implement a system that not only challenges James but utilizes the other quality players on the squad in fashions that maximize their talents as well.    Yeah, what clearly is controversial  - note that you needed no more than the word ""controversial"" to note precisely what was that - is the Green suspension.  I don't know your allegiance, but those outside of Cleveland or the East noted James and his involvement on multiple fronts, and of course the non-suspension of TT this Finals for numerous infractions only amplifies that controversy.  But hey, don't let me interfere in your outrage.  And it *is* now waste laid in the wake of James: largest payroll in the NBA, seriously awful contracts to seriously devolving players who are all but impossible to trade without severe penalty - contracts done because James lobbied for them to take place and an insecure Cleveland obliged, the real future of the club now in Boston, a coach who has been outed as incompetent and impotent, and James toying with the city yet again.  They fell short of where they could have arrived, which is multiple rings.  And making the Finals from the East is a joke, so please keep your legitimacy intact and don't run that up the flagpole as some amazing standard."
"Jordan/Pippen is the best duo in NBA history.  That said, a great pairing no one has mentioned is LeBron James and Dwayne Wade."
"I still remember the video on youtube that got me into basketball, It was called “LeBron James Kanye West 09 Amazin’ Cavaliers Highlights” and it must have been deleting since the last time I saw it but wow it was great and watching LeBron doing the things he did just launched me into basketball and now I’m a huge LeBron fan. I still look up to him as someone who works just as hard off the court as he does on and that he does it to support kids that grow up like him. He doesn’t have to but he does it to raise awareness that they can get out too."
"Time will tell if I am wrong, but I think NBA currently seriously underrates international talent.  The man is MVP on whats far and away the 2nd best league in the world at age 19. Has been playing pro basketball since 16. I mean, I would get not picking him first if you have a LeBron James kind of prospect in the draft, but if not he should go first."
"I think its situational but more or less agree with you. Obviously LeBron wouldn't be the player he is without the phenomenal athleticism, but to your point, who's the stud athlete on the Dubs? They all have mediocre athleticism at this point. Hell James Harden was knocked for his athleticism and he's been at worst the 3rd best player in the league the last several years. He's honestly perfect for today's NBA which is all about pick and roll and finding open shooters on the wings. No idea how someone could watch the western conference finals last month and not have this guy #1 on their board."
"i fail to see how joining another team with LeBron James would be a ""great challenge for him"". "
"""Iguodala to Curry, back to Iguodala, up for the layup! Oh! Blocked by James! LeBron James with the rejection!"""
"Yeah but the LA rumors came after everyone assumed LeBron James isn't about championships anymore. Not to mention willfully walking into Kobe's shadow. Doesn't make sense, especially when he's already number 2 to Jordan."
"LeBron James is the all time PPG, PER, MPG leader on both the Cavs and Heat."
"&gt;When people argue for him as top 5 you’ll almost always see the phrases “killer instinct”, “will to win” etc.   Well of course you would. Kobe has a reputation amongst his NBA peers as a relentless player and an assassin.   &gt;He’s simply not a top 5 player unless you give him imaginary bonus points for stuff like that.  It's not imaginary if it's talked about and it is. But for the record, Kobe has the second most First Team All NBA selections in NBA history. Tied with Karl Malone, second only to LeBron James. However, he is also tied with Michael Jordan, Gary Payton and Kevin Garnett with the most First Team All Defense selections in NBA history and has more All Defense selections than any guard in NBA history.

"I think he will see where LeBron goes first, if James goes to LA I think George will follow, if for whatever reason LeBron doesn’t go to LA I think George will either sign a 5 year max with OKC or go 1 year and wait till Leonard becomes a free agent. If the Lakers miss out on James and Leonard this summer I think George will give OKC one more shot with Westbrook and Carmelo. If they win it all he’ll stay, if they lose in the first round again he’s running to LA."

I wonder what the Lakers have up their sleeves. Are they just going to roll out Chris Paul/Lonzo Ball/Lebron James 1-3? Ingram at the 4 or 3 (and Lebron at the 4?).  The passing would be pretty insane with that perimeter trio.

Bagley is next Jahlil, mark my words.     RemindMe! 4 years,     when Doncic has 3 titles and 2 MVP's, Ayton is a 15min role player and Bagley is out of the league."
"&gt;He is part of this problem too.  100%, Westbrook is not a perfect player. I respect the shit out of him but he's a flawed hero for sure.   &gt;LeBron James would make Anthony work.

Holy shit their economy is Lebron James
"I would always pick a Lebron James. Lebron James has proven that he is the best basketball talent ever, He attracts players, fans, and money, he has won multiple MVPs and titles, he manages to drag garbage to a finals where he averaged a triple double at 33 against a team that not only was far superior to him but also included 2 mvps and 3 of the 5 greatest shooters of all time. Lebron James has never been injured. He is a multiple all star and first team all nba  Paul George is cool but he was Lebrons bitch in the east"
"Because “of the future” really matters when you just signed a 34 year old Lebron James and let a 23 year old with much promise walk to sign a veteran PG.    Kawhi wants LA.  Lonzo &amp; Kuz is enough.  Lakers keep Ingram, and move Luol Deng for an expiring C like Gortat or Kanter even by either throwing in Hart or a 1st.    "
Lebron James
What kind of mental gymnastics does one have to do in order to believe that a team who just signed Lebron James isn't trying to compete next year.   These fucking nephews man

LeBron James Jr has never made a shot nor even had the confidence to take an attempt in the NBA environment. I don't know how you can top that as a bust
"Let’s just rule Booker out right now. He’ll never be as all-around impactful as any of the other 4. Just not gonna happen, he’s never gonna add shot blocking or rebounding to the level of the big dudes. We’re talking about becoming the #1 guy in the world and I really don’t see it ever being Devin Booker. The same way that James Harden is great, but I’m picking LeBron and KD over him 10/10 times.  I’d put Embiid and KAT on a tier lower than Giannis and AD, because they both have larger question marks (health and defense, respectively), and don’t say Giannis’ question mark is shooting because he and Joel shoot the same percentage from deep."
"Most of those things would also apply to him playing for the Clippers though right? He chose the Lakers for reasons beyond just those you listed, I'm almost positive part of the allure is playing for such a storied franchise. Unless by business you mean better endorsments then maybe but he's LeBron fucking James, he'd get endorsments playing anywhere."
"If you worried about chemistry between LeBron James and Lance Stephenson, here's reason for optimism. **LeBron James!**"
LeBron James and the Misfits.  Truly outrageous.
"I mean, just imagine... you're a rookie getting drafted as the first round pick for the LA Lakers. Maybe not the hottest team these past few years, but goddamn what a dynasty. You get to play for the same fans that cheered on Shaq and Kobe. They'll print a jersey with your name on it. The dream.      And then, only 2 weeks later, you wake up, open twitter and find out that LeBron James is joining your team?!   WHAT. THE. FUCK."
"I would consider what the Lakers currently have plus Kawhi to be better than the Warriors.   PG Curry vs. Lonzo - Advantage Curry but Lonzo is a good defender/facilitator.  SG Thompson vs. Leonard - Advantage Leonard as he's a better creator and defender.   SF Iguodala vs James - Advantage James. Iguodala was hampered by injuries last year and his value took a step back.  PF Durant vs. Ingram - Advantage Durant.  C Green vs. McGee - Advantage Green.  Despite the lopsided advantage of Green vs. whatever the Lakers decide to throwout at Center, the Lakers matchup very well defensively against the Warriors and would give the Warriors fits on the other side of the ball as both LeBron and Kawhi have historically had their way with the Warriors. "
"Except for LeBron, all these dudes are on one year contracts.  Every move the Lakers are making is for next year.   Do you guys seriously think LeBron agreed to a 4 year deal not knowing what the FO was going to do the next fucking day? You don't think Magic didn't lay all this out for James in that 3 hour convo?  LeBron's the VP of the player's union and probably knows the money situation for each team like 5 years out. You don't think he knew the lay of the land before committing to 4 years?   Were you people all born yesterday?  "
When it's over... when it's all said and done...  we're going to look back at this in 20 years... 50 years... 200 years.. and realize that Lebron Raymone James was John Doe the whole time... and he always had the upper hand.

"One ring in short career in one of the most top heavy league in the world is pretty fing good.   The reason I say that its because its out of his control.   Jerry Krause is not the best gm in history (far from it) but won 6 rings.   Barry bonds is arguably the best baseball player in history (although with steroids) has 0 rings.  Dan Marino.... Michelle Kwan... etc  Any gm can win if Michael Jordan falls to them in the draft or lebron James, etc.   Considering none of these variables happened during his time and was a perennial contender while winning a championship?? Also, after winning the first one look how short the celtics rebuild time was. It's insane.   Saying that he isn't even in the conversation is blasphemy."
GM Anthony Davis vs GM LeBron James
My lasting impression of JR Smith came in locker room scrum after Lebron  James had 51 vs. Suns:   Me: You’ve played with &amp; against a lot of great players in your career. Can you put into perspective what LeBron is doing right now?   JR: Whatcha want me to do? Suck him off?   Me: Uh.
" Lavar Ball yelled, “There you go!” Rajon Rondo gave a look of pleasant surprise. Javale belted, “We got no f****** shooting now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Magic Johnson hugged him &amp; said, “please God help me Im trying my best.”   "
"They're going to make the playoffs. Honestly sad to see Randle go.  Simply adding LeBron James, would've made the Lakers playoff  contenders.  Last year the Lakers were a bad rut and close games away from making the playoffs, and having a player like LeBron would've won them most of those games.  And this year, all those players would potentially be better.  Without Randle now though, I feel like we've progressed, only to regress to where we are still better than we were last year, but not as good as we could've (realistically) been."
You got Lebron James in a Laker uniform 2 minutes ago and y'all already lamenting what you dont have.
"Lebron James defense was the worse it's ever been in his entire career last year, but please lets continue circlejerking"
"Lmao LeBron embraced being GM even before signing.  “Hello LeBron James, so you would like to sign with the Lakers?”  “Why yes LeBron James I would like to.”"
"Have you seen Toronto in the playoffs ? How is their regular season relevant to the fact that they shit the bed every playoffs and even when they win they play the way that make their fans depressed.  17/18 Celtics played without 2 best players in the playoffs, our best player was a rookie, the fact that we made it that far was already overachievement. I don't see a East team without Lebron James winning a seriers on the west against a team with a seed higher than 7 (unless you count healthy Celtics this year)."
"It's not but Los Angeles is a better fit for the James family. Also, its a 4-year deal, they get Kawhi next year, KD and Klay are FA next offseason so the Warriors may***** start to fall off during this contract.  Colangelo fucked us over we don't have the assets now for Kawhi and so we don't get Lebron. "
A good coach would stick to the system and not have lebron ball style impelented. Ball movement would slash lebron james stats tremendously but the team and himself will be more efficient than the stupid drive and kick pick and roll.   Plus imagine all the stamina he will saving up by doing simple picks for a KCP Curl 3 point shot. 
So LeBron averages 50 ppg getting feeds from Rondo/Lonzo while KP gets 15 and Ingram/Kuzma/Hart get 25-35 between them.. that's 100 per game with great defence and James can rest on defence.   If they add Leonard the defence will be unreal for this team.   Warriors will still beat them but it'll be a fight to do so. Ya know like 140 to 100 but Dray fouls out haha
"Because this roster isn't done yet. LA can still get Kawhi Leonard and Paul George if everything goes right. If Kawhi fully recovers from his injury, you'll have Ball, George, Leonard, James, and McGee, with a bench that's better than the whole Cavs team, who LeBron managed to take to the Finals. If (and only if) the Lakers get who they want, they'd have a decent chance at the title."

They already have guys who are good with the ball. "

"The trades Rob and Magic executed these past two years agree with you. They traded Lou Will somewhere he could compete and traded Nance to his hometown to play alongside Lebron James. Rob even said as much in an interview that they factor in the human element into every decision they make, and it shows."
Im serious. You agree he isn't valuing more rings but say that he doesnt give a fuck what people thinks. Are you defending LeBron James' self-esteem?
Breaking News: Kobe comes out of retirement to play alongside LeBron James 
LeBron James cannot be injured. He has nanobots that heal him instantaneously. 
"He will not play in LA for the minimum salary.  Like obviously.  If the Lakers actually interpreted his desire to mean that he will play for anything less than a max deal, they would be stupid.  The best players are worth more than the max. This is generally accepted. So when Kawhi says he wants to play for the Lakers, I mean, there is some room for negotiation but not really that much and it's up to Leonard if he'll give them some sort of break, like Warriors players have.  The point is, again, none of this bullshit has or will have any impact on Leonards value. If he manages to sit out a full season the only people looking bad are going to be the Spurs. Not Leonard when he drops 27/8 with 5 steals and a block in his debut for the Lakers alongside Lebron James. Just the Spurs.  They know this. They will trade him. "
Which we then proceeded to sit on until it became LeBron James Jr
Lebron just changed the title betting odds significantly even when we don't the full roster of LAkers yet. Like I said keeping PG was the 2nd best news this offseason  but the STORY here is Lebron James and wherever he signed.

I realized that when I came over here it was a very, very different game with a whole new set of problems and a whole slew of things to deal with inside and outside of the game.""  &gt;He's mostly talking about ego management, roles, the hectic and difficult schedule, and the fact that there are restrictions on how much you can practice in training camp. He jokingly says he wishes there wasn't a player's union. (Note to David: If NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts hears this, she's' going to denounce you. It doesn't matter if you were wearing a clown costume doing standup on Letterman Colbert. She'll fight just about anything.) However, even the slight change of attitude is a good look.[*](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/david-blatt-finally-admits-coaching-in-the-nba-is-harder-than-he-thought/)  He did not know how to navigate the NBA, celebrity, and lack the professional wherewithol to start practice on time:  &gt; Well, James did ask for something else. He wanted practice to start.  &gt;Cleveland coach David Blatt met with reporters after James and Kevin Love took questions, and about eight minutes into Blatt's session, James barked: ""How many more *(not nice word)* questions y'all gonna ask?""  &gt;James then directed his teammates to each find a basketball and ""get up and down,"" essentially starting the warm-up. [*](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/11/lebron_james_was_tired_of_wait.html)  [LeBron elaborates on this. In a candid interview, documented a year thereafter, where he explains issues he sees in the league.](https://youtu.be/kFwsmL2Txxo?t=11m34s)  &gt; One is coaching, because they don't want to coach. On all levels...Either the coach, or the commander of the team, need to nip that in the butt as soon as they see something...If there is a player on the team doing something that he shouldn't be doing, the coach has to address it or the leader of the team has to address it, because now it unravels the whole thing.  This could be considered unrelated, but when we peek behind the curtains in an article:  &gt; I wouldn't want to be you,"" according to a source. Jones said it because he knew Griffin was dealing with the beginnings of an uprising.  &gt;Griffin sat in on a film session and jumped on James for not getting back on defense against the Nuggets, one of his bad habits. James accepted the criticism in stride, sources said. But this moment only inspired less faith in Blatt because it is supposed to be the coach -- not the GM -- holding the players accountable.  &gt;Within days, both Williams and Smith showed up late for games, arriving less than an hour before tipoff. Blatt said it was dealt with internally. Some around the team expressed surprise that multiple players did that, and it was thought of as another example of a lack of accountability.  No one discounts Blatt's ability to do X &amp; Os. He's been a coach for 23 years. However, ego management, building relationships and accountability were integral to developing a professional environment. This has been hinted as an issue in his hiring, as well as the Cavalier's organization, throughout (and before) LeBron's return. Kyrie recently disclosed ""[it was the environment] that was not conduscive to [him] being genuinely happy"".   There was dysfunction. Blatt wasn't a good fit. One of the issues he was late to starting practice. He didn't appear to hold players accountable. They (not just Lebron, if even him, appears to) show respect for him, and he didn't have them performing their best in the year he got fired. Far too many disregard all these factors exhibited in the articles aforementioned, and spout out ""LeCoach"" and ""LeGm"" and how he got Blatt fired.   No, I wasn't there. However, nor were you. So to downplay what actual journalist detailed and the results of not LeBron James, but David Griffin releasing him mid-season, doesn't just show a disregard for jouranlistic integrity, but a dismissal to the literal facts that LeBron did not get nor fired David Blatt.  David Griffin fired him and there wasn't a peep in the locker room, in management, or the organization head, that seemed to be unsettled by it. But, continue thinking every redditor hasn't done any research on the subject before say anything.   **tldr**; David Blatt wasn't a good fit and there are several statements by him, others, and jouranlist to verify how he didn't start practice, insurbodinations from others and David Griffin had more command over the locker room than he did.

President LeBron James
Al Jefferson be heavy set all his career too. LeBron James takes care of his body.
"They also may have gained some with a team like Philly. There's not a ton of reason and evidence to believe that Kawhi Leonard suddenly wants to tie his future to what LeBron James does, and Philly now no longer has the option for PG *or* LeBron. And they just watched PG go to a much smaller market, after publicly stating he wanted to be a Laker (while Kawhi still hasn't publicly said anything) and he re-signed. So while I can see them losing leverage, I can also see another perspective being that they gained some. The East is now up for grabs and a huge void is left, so I wouldn't be surprised to see the contenders get in an arms race. "

"I want to preface this by saying please don't murder me.     Michael Jordan. I'm not doubting his incredible athletic feats or his 'killer instinct' or his status as the GOAT of the NBA. I completely agree with all of that. But the one thing that gets brought up about him that irks me is his NBA Finals record.     The fact that he is 6-0 in the NBA Finals is, in my opinion, circumstantial. It particularly annoys me when sports commentators use that specific argument against people who have lost in the Finals (LeBron James, Kobe Bryant etc.) when it comes to the GOAT debate. Imagine if the Detroit Pistons played in the West during 1989-1990 instead of the East. It's likely that MJ and the Chicago Bulls make it to the Finals but ultimately fall to the Pistons. (And MJ would perhaps, be 6-2 instead.) It just annoys me when people bring up 6-0 because it suggests that MJ only puts out his best performance during the Finals and always wins it ""when the lights are brightest"". He's the most competitive athlete ever in the NBA, it's not like MJ isn't trying as hard in the ECF as he would in the Finals."
"In regards to Lonzo/Bron:  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2018/6/29/17516126/lakers-free-agency-lonzo-ball-lebron-james-fit-together  Brook Lopez is a free agent.  IT is definitely gone.  Randle is currently a RFA, but I think he'd work really well in pick and roll, or off ball in pick and roll situations.  He would also be a beast in the fast break with lonzo/bron.  I would definitely like to see more shooters on the team."
They got this one dude - LeBron James?

"Bro you were the one who said we saw Kyrie play in the regular season as a testament to how the team would play with him healthy. You’re really comparing the Celtics to the Warriors? And Mitchel to Lebron James?   &gt;	Boston lost games 6 and 7 because players just couldnt hit shots and choked under pressure. I wonder who wouldve changed that...    Not the player whos cant play due to injury thats for sure.  &gt;	Cmon man you’d be lying to yourself if you think Boston doesnt win with Kyrie.  Of course they probably win, but you didn’t even say that. You said 5 games. And you’re lying to yourself if you think Kyrie gets and stays healthy all year, but the Lakers don’t make a roster change. You’re basically assuming the best scenario for your team and the worst for the Lakers.  Hey maybe IT gets healthy and becomes the Kyrie replacement he was supposed to be. "

Only the Lakers can have people predicting Lebron James will win less than 50 games 
"Depends. He can't make more than max, so if he gets traded and the salary cap had gone up such that his salary is no longer 35&amp;#37;, he would then get that kicker. Likely it's meaningless other than ""I'm LeBron James and I want every possible clause there is."""
"I know you're gonna get downvoted but it's Lebron James we're talking about, any team he plays has a very good chance at being in the conference finals."

"For what the 2013-2014 season? Okay so lets get out of the way that KD, Lebron and CP3 are given. Now lets go through other options  * Kevin Love - 26.1/12.5/4.4 on .457/.376/.821 PER 26.9 TS% .591 VORP 7.3 - Dude had a monster year, nearly carried his in shambles Timberwolves team to the playoffs, KMart, Pekovic, and a ton of bench guys all missed significant time. He was arguably a top 5 if not top 3 offensive player than year, scoring from anywhere on court.  * James Harden - 25.9/4.9/5.7 on .438/.367/.851 per 23.5 TS 61.8% VORP 5.4 - It was his second straight year in a row of solid numbers, proving that he was truly a league superstar. Similar criticisms for lack of defensive effort.  * Steph Curry - 24.0/4.3/8.5 on .471/.424/.885 PER 24.1 TS 61%, VORP 6.7 - Excellent scoring and passing year for Steph became the man on the arriors team, setting three point shooting records, pushed them to a solid playoff showing.  * Paul George - 21.7/6.8/2.5 .424/.364/.864 per 20.1 TS% 55.5 VORP 4.9 - Wasn't proving he was arguably the best two player in the league at the time. Increased his offensive load while being the wing anchor defensively for the Pacers.   * Blake Griffin - 24.1/9.5/3.9 .528/.273/.715 PER 23.9, TS 58.3% VORP 4.8 - Blake really excelled, taking on a larger offensive load, mixing up his game so it wasn't just dunks expanding his shooting range and post moves. It was an impressive year for Blake.  Then because I'm getting tired you also have Joakim Noah's breakout season, dude carried the Bulls to the playoffs revolutionizing the center position, Boggie was breaking out, Anthony Davis etc. There was easily 2 guys who were better than him.  If you were talking about the year previous I don't know how you argue him over Lebron, KD, CP3, Kobe, Brodie, Gasol, Westbrook etc. He had a great scoring season in 2012-2013, but it was one of this worse seasons defensively.He coasted by having Kidd, Chandler, Shump, KMart covering him.

I think that Lonnie Walker in 2 years will be among the best rookie starters in the league.  I think BI is a monster, Kuz will also be a fringe superstar in the coming 3 years, but Zo is a joke and the Spurs coaching staff is way better so I expect more productivity out of less talent. The growth of your young stars will be stifled, not promoted, by the addition of Lebron James to your team's lineup whereas our young players are essentially our team's superstars.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Carmelo Anthony. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched E7MO in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. E7MO's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's probably a top-15 greatest SF ever, and was one of the 5 best players to ever play the game at at least one point in his career. So when I hear somebody say that E7MO has never been a top 5 player, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched ME70 in his 2013 wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that E7MO is better. You might be jealous of Melo's ~~rings~~ career earnings, or jealous of his status as the ~~greatest~~ a really good scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Nuggets fan who watched basketball in the 2000's, or a Knicks fan who watched basketball in the 2010's, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-~~win~~ get paid basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Melo isn't even a top 1000 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Melo being a top 5 player at at least one point in his career talk to the adults. Fair? "
yeah...you might have a bad time if you try to call Lebron James soft. 39 mpg for 15 years.
The minute Lebron James starts taking career advice from TT....well....it will be a cold day in hell.
"this is an absolutely useless stat given that lebron led the nba in jersey sales his rookie season, and remained top 3 in jersey sales every year he was in cleveland up until his departure, i.e. sold millions of cavs jerseys already.    of course there's going to be a huge spike in sales of a lebron lakers jerseys relative to figures from the 8th year of lebron cavs jersey sales.   If they compared the lakers sales figure to his initial heat jersey sales figures (which is blatantly the more relevant comparison to draw) and saw the same spike, that would be relevant, but they won't, because the figures are probably similar, and then this non-story would be even more obvious.   in case you didn't realize, the clause mentioned in the headline isn't even present in his nike contract anymore, as seen in the third sentence of this standard ESPN clickbait bullshit. &gt;Now, 15 years later, the four-time MVP is finally joining one of those major markets, as he's set to play his 16th NBA season with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although the ""lifetime"" Nike contract he signed in 2015 no longer includes that market bonus, James' ongoing signature series is expected to get a significant boost from his latest move."
"I think when your best friends are Lebron James and Dwayne Wade, you might often feel ""less than"" and try to do more than you should. Melo is wealthy for life and should be happy to go whatever he wants."

This is the most narrative driven subreddit in all the lands. "
And all the comments were like “OMG savage!!!” . That post wasn’t even good and the section about LeBron was so cringey. Like Melo should be ashamed he’s not as good as him? It’s fucking LeBron James lmao 
"I’ve been a die-hard LeBron James fan since he got swept back in 07 by the spurs. I’ve always like players more than teams in basketball, so I’ve always followed lebron intensely. Out of all his rivals in his career, i have more respect and admiration for Gregg popovich than anyone lebron has or will ever face."
"Did you read his post? He gave reasons for everything, just not long winded ones. Lebron and kd were clearly better so that's those 2, td was 1st team all nba, lead the league in defensive rating and went to the finals, almost beating Miami. Gasol won dpoy, was 2nd team all nba (same as melo) and led the grizz to the wcf.   Cp3 is where it gets close. Regular season, obviously melo was the better scorer. But cp3 had the same tov averaging 7 ast more per game. Ts was..59 vs. 56 (melo was 100 or so in the league for true shooting, so around average). USG is where it gets interesting. Melo led the league with 35%, almost 5% higher than the next closest. Cp3 had an usage of 22%.  Cp3 had better advanced stats in the playoffs, and made it to 6 games with an injured Blake Griff on vs the grizz. Melo had he highest ppg of the playoffs and beat Boston 4-2,lost to the pacers 4-2 on 38% usage.  Again its close, I'd take cp3 personally because he makes other players so much better but it's debatable.  But you're acting like the guy just said ""a b c were better and that's that"". He did give reasons.  As a note, if you look at all nba voting, melo was 397,cp3 392. Cp3 made 1st team as a guard, melo made 2nd team because of Durant and James. But they were damn close that year.  "

KD, Chris Paul and Lebron were. From the post: &gt;  &gt; If it makes everyone feel better the difference in average score between CP3 (3.27) and Russell Westbrook (6.15) was higher than the difference between Westbrook and James Harden (8.96). &gt;  &gt; Which means 1-3 were simple choices for everyone and 4-12 was a fucking mess. &gt;  &gt; Everyone had different opinions on who should get those last two spots in the top 5."

"I made a post a month back calculating TAPG (total assists per game), if you're interested:  This season marks the first time that the NBA has tracked probably the most important non-boxscore occurrence in the game - screen assists.  I feel like these aren't discussed enough as a major factor in offensive prowess. A good, smart screener can provide high-quality playmaking opportunities just as well as a good passer.   Players who can do both are extremely rare and pose a versatile threat in the half-court.  TAPG (Total Assists per Game) is a stat that combines these two to calculate a total number of opportunities created by the player that directly lead to a score.

"I honest to god don’t remember anyone that was in touch with the NBA arguing that melo was a top 5 player year in year out with the exception of 2012-2013 and whatever carryover affect it had in 2013-2014. Anyone rational would just say he’s an annual all star, top 10-15 player in the league. If you can prove he was worse than 15 players year in year out from a few years into his career until 2013-14 — that’d pique my interest.  People just don’t like melo because he’s a dick and has made decisions we don’t agree with. But I really don’t get this argument — no one with a good pulse on the game year in year out would’ve tried to contend melo was a top 5 player. He came up in an era with Paul pierce, kg, dirk, lebron, Nash, Shaq, d wade, Duncan, McGrady, Bryant, Iverson, Chris Paul, Ray Allen. Ive gotta be missing some but they’re all HOFers that melo never had an argument of being better than, with the exception of being a better scorer than guys like cp3, Nash, kg, Allen, etc. I’ve never heard anyone try and argue he was better than any of those guys though.  People can’t seem to accept what melo is. The thing I’ll remember about Melo’s career is that he was always held up against LeBron James and i have no idea why people felt the need to do so. Maybe it’s because he talks a big game, maybe it’s because he’s a prick who seems indifferent about winning"

Anyone who watches basketball understands that this signing won't just go away. LeBron James was the player that signed with them FYI. Statistics show that he's a decent player. 
"So lets actually go through this statement by statement...  &gt;Lebron is here for the media and the money  Not sure why this is so outrageous. He has quicker access to Hollywood from L.A., and his brand will grow outside of the United States due to now being on a classic and popular franchise. Furthermore, we saw recently that his Nike contract would pay him more if he was in L.A. (as well as Chicago and Manhattan). In regards to media, this doesn't seem so far fetched, as we've seen Lebron trying to increase his political sway and attempt to get involved with politics, especially with his endorsement of Clinton.   &gt;Hollywood is ground-zero for the social justice and race warriors  True statement. Hollywood has historically slanted left and continues to do so. Just to quote statistics from a [New York Times article] (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/opinion/sunday/hollywood-liberal.html)  &gt;&gt;where Hillary Clinton received three votes for every one that went to Donald Trump in Los Angeles County as a whole, actor-heavy areas like the Hollywood Hills recorded even more-lopsided tallies. Likewise, the Center for Responsive Politics reports that individuals and firms in the television, movie and music industries gave $84 million in campaign contributions during the 2016 election cycle, with 80 percent going to Democrats.  &gt;Hollywood controls popular controls popular culture  Not entirely sure what he means by ""popular culture"", but it is true that most people, both political and apolitical, look to icons as sources of knowledge and philosophy. Actors inherently act as icons, and so to do athletes. Lebron is unquestionably an icon and is looked to on a variety of political issues. Lebron knows this, and that is why he's taken great measures to become more politically active.  &gt;And Lebron came here to be fitted out for his multi-million dollar puppet strings  Can't say I agree with the terminology - I do find it to be harsh. However, it is  true that politicians, and by extension, political parties, use icons as ways to push agendas and make certain ideas popular. Furthermore, all Hollywood award shows are scripted - the writers know exactly what they're doing. Now, I don't think Whitlock is trying to say Lebron does not believe what he preaches - but I do think he is acknowledging the reality that is Hollywood has a left leaning agenda to push, and they will do so via any means necessary.  &gt;Did y'all see the movie ""Black Panther""? Of course, everyone saw it! The lead star of the movie, T'Challa, was a puppet for a group of liberal, black feminists. He didn't do anything that his mama, girlfriend, and female security guard didn't tell him to do.  Didn't watch the movie (INB4 I get called a racist or such, I don't like superhero movies or movies in general, period.), so I can't really comment on this, but whether or not it is true, I think Whitlock is trying to reinforced the idea that Hollywood is pushing a left slanting agenda, which is true.   &gt;That is how liberal Hollywood sees the Black man, a puppet to be controlled  So, in retrospect, I assume the point Whitlock was making before with Black Panther is that Hollywood views actors and icons as pawns to be controlled. I think this is true of all of those in power - they see people as pawns to be used, regardless of race, gender, etc.  &gt;Lebron is going to be the real life T'Challa - his handlers will be left-leaning, Hollywood executives, colonizers  Again, too harsh for my liking, however outspoken conservatives tend to have tougher times getting jobs, and Hollywood has made it popular to be a liberal, so Lebron will most likely need to stick to being liberal to maximize his potential earnings.   &gt;They are going to spend the next decade framing James as the anti-Kanye West, as a liberal superhero, able to leave Donald Trump with a single-bow.  Again, conjecture, however, as I mentioned above, Lebron is certainly beginning to become more active in politics, and those in power use those with less power as pawns.   &gt;Lebron may never win another NBA title,  Probably won't, to be honest  &gt;... but I can guarantee you in 10 years, people will be whispering his name as a Democratic nominee for President,  Most likely true. Icons win over public opinion and elections, so he would be a good way to get apolitical citizens to both vote for him and potentially align with the Democratic Party in future elections.  &gt;...and they will damn sure call him the Mohammed Ali of this generation  If he becomes a Democratic nominee, I can definitely see this narrative begin to take form  Conclusion: While Whitlock may seem unaligned with reality, Hollywood knows how to play the political game, and they know in 2018 the way to win elections is to have a popular candidate - they tried the opposite with Hillary, and got beat by a reality T.V. star. Unfortunately, it seems very few sincerely use policy as a means by which to decide whom to vote for. The way to win elections is to win over popular opinion and apolitical voters, and the way to do that is via icons. Lebron is one of the world's most recognized athletes, and even more so domestically. Again, Hollywood knows how to play the game. They have made their move with Lebron. "
i stopped reading when your argument is melo made 1st round once. yet lebron is goat redditors always absolve lebron james of the blame on his finals losses by citing how bad his teammates were and how much of an underdog lebron was in losses.
"Stats wise it's basically a wash. Carmelo had like 0.1 ppg on Lebron, better efficiency and slightly more rebounds in 2 fewer minutes. Lebron makes up for it with a large assist advatage.  As other have stated the nuggets turn around was more than just adding Carmelo. In any case ROY is absolutely the dumbest award to use team success as a criteria. By design the best Rookies go to the worst team...  I give lebron Lebron the edge for two reasons.    He did have the hype going for him yes. But you could also say he had a lot more pressure on him. From the start some people wanted to see him fail people were looking for any reason to take Lebron down a few pegs. Carmelo never had to deal with that kind of pressure.  Lebron meant more to his team and did more for his team in ways that aren't immeduately tangible. Lebron  over the course of the year became the leader of that team at 19. He played the right way said the right things and elevated his teammates, and that should count for something. Ask any coach at the time if they'd rather have Carmelo or James and it would be James  in a landslide. The few dissenting voices have since been proven to be wrong."
"Obviously he's not LeBron James. But we have no idea how much he can carry a team. He hasn't had to try since he was 21 years old. And of course if we assume his inability to stay consistently healthy continues, which is reasonable, there's 100% no way he can do it. But whether or not its a talent issue is unknown.   I believe the person to whom I was replying also said, ""Same with the Celtics,"" in terms of having a better record without him, which was what I was pointing out was false. They were quite a bit better with him than without him."
he's going to sign lebron james jr
"All the top 10 teams will be fighting for spots still, and now Lebron James is in the conversation. 3 playoff calibre teams won't make it. It will be crazy."
"definitely, powerbeats 3 earphones https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/16/beats-ad-lebron-james-nba-all-stars/ "
"Small market is a weakass excuse too.  Westbrook and KD (*RIP*) played in OKC with a population of ~600k and were the superstar youngins of the NBA.  LeBron James singlehandedly carved Cleveland (*~380k*) into NBA history with the past four finals. They received more media attention than pretty much any other NBA city outside LA, SF or NY.  Kawhi was the heir to the greatest NBA dynasty of the past two decades in a city more than twice as big as OKC and more than 5 times larger than Cleveland(*~1.6m*).  He could have had his shot. If he spoke, people damn well would have listened. It doesn’t matter how big your stage is if you won’t get up onto it. Doesn’t matter if you’re in San Antonio or Los Angeles."
"Teams are built to make money, not win games. Winning games is an indirect goal because it is a means to make money. With the warriors seemingly guaranteed to win this season, moneyball beats moreyball.   Having a hall of famer at the end of his career may not win games, but it does increase the amount of money people will pay to see games. If I’m able to see Houston play in Chicago and James harden is injured, I might still go to see Carmelo’s wet, wet jumper, even if those jumpers are fewer and further between these days...   And let’s not forget that most teams including the rockets have terrible salary situations and that after KD (100% golden state), PG (80% okc 20% LA) and Lebron (maybe philly or Cleveland but probably LA) quickly telegraphed their intentions the rox simply had few options. If they can get melo, who is more popular and respected among players than ppl seem to realize, they keep CP3 happy and perhaps increase their chances of scoring a nice trade later on with a good player who has an ntc.  This is all partly speculative on my part but the nba is an entertainment business and Carmelo has good name recognition and a loyal fan base among the target consumers. "
**Top 5**   1. Anthony Davis 2. Lebron James 3. Joel Embiid 4. Giannis  5. Devin Booker  
"&gt;Well for one I adore the regular season  Yeah, I bet you do.   &gt;they did that three years?  Yeah, *three* years ago.    &gt;the only guy that prevented that from happening multiple times was LeBron Fucking James.  Raptors shouldn't have gotten swept this season by these Cavs. Now you got teams like Philly and Boston who are only gonna get better.  "
"Well for one I adore the regular season and for two they did that three years? ago which not many other teams can say. Plus the only guy that prevented that from happening multiple times was LeBron Fucking James. So, yeah.."
"He can definitely be part of a winning team he's already proven that. But he is not Lebron James, Anthony Davis, James Harden etc. in terms of *carrying teams* or being the main reason why your team is winning."
LeBron James own a Switch.
"After beating the Lakers, Rockets, Warriors, and 76ers.  Dirk Nowitzki hoists the 2019 NBA championship trophy over his head.  As he passes the trophy to Luka Doncic and Dennis Smith jr. he puts a hand on both their shoulders and passes on his power of loyalty and greatness.  The Dallas Mavericks go on to win it all in 2020, 2022, and 2024.  In 2027 Luka Doncic leaves the Mavericks to form a new super team with Donovan Mitchell, Joel Embiid, Lebron James jr., Liangelo Ball, and Robo-Charles Barkley on the California Warriors (there is only one team in california after the meteor wild fires of 2025).  Life comes at you fast."
"also, people underrate Bron as a scorer bc he didn’t have foot work fadeaways and uses his body, etc... but 12-13 Lebron James is no question a better scorer than Carmelo, he just shot less. I don’t care about better finesse it’s about points, and efficiency helps lol and Melo scoring a couple more ppg on way more shots... yeah nah, Bron was a better scorer too."
I believe Lebron James will be a bust on the Lakers
And I think CP3 is like waaay high in that category. LeBron James also.
Lebron James should of join them :(
"OKC got slept by a rookie led team and the last time I checked Lebron James was alot better than Donovan Mitchell, so i'm not too afraid of OKC."
"I think the Lakers make the most sense with their cap situation and their young talent.  Lebron James changes that team.  They are suddenly, IMO, the best place in the league next year for anyone to sign and they have the cap space to get it done.  They're also the Lakers: they're in a huge market, with a huge fanbase, and they're one of the most storied franchises in NBA history.  If I'm a star free agent next summer, LA is at the top of my list of teams I want a meeting with.  Plus you get to take a shot at the Warriors, who are your in state rival.  The set up here is perfect!"
Seriously though. LeBron James is on the fucking LA Lakers lol whaaaatttt

"Yeah, but don't act like it was excellent coaching and team management at work. It was more a result of Kyrie and LeBron playing out of their fucking minds.  Not every team has LeBron James and can afford to make a plethora of bad decisions but still manage to be competitive. Imagine how many championships they would have won had they made sensible roster decisions and not hamstrung themselves with capspace. "
LeBron James is just overall able to do more things than Michael Jordan on a basketball court. Case closed
"It’s a good stat. Just because you want to discredit it to justify your argument, doesn’t mean it’s a bad stat  Also, Mo Williams did make an all-star game because of Lebron. Lebron basically begged the NBA to put him in the all-star game. Mo Williams wasn’t even supposed to be there in the first place.   http://www.espn.com/nba/allstar2009/news/story?id=3897494  &gt; Williams wasn't voted in by the fans, nor was he chosen by Eastern Conference head coaches as a reserve. Then he was passed over by Stern in favor of Boston's Ray Allen, who is replacing injured Orlando guard Jameer Nelson on the roster.  &gt; The Cavs then took their complaints public, contending they were the only team in the top five without more than one All-Star. LeBron James called it a ""total smack in the face.""  Mo wasn’t good enough to be an all-star that year, according to fans and coaches. He got an all-star selection because the Cavs publicly bitched about it, and Stern appealed to them. "
"Dude, the headline of the article is ""Lakers' Luke Walton to consult with Cavs' Ty Lue on LeBron James"". Walton called Lue. You really gotta at least click the link before you comment."
"You like memes? We got the meme team.  You don’t like Warriors? We are SoCal and they are NorCal.  You like smart players that are also good role models? We got LeBron James.  You like genuinely funny and that are misunderstood w shitty pasts? We got lots of them, especially Lance Stephenson.  You like underdog stories? Lakers are a bad team w potential.  You like being good from the get go? Lakers are a mysterious team w really high potential.  You like basketball? We love basketball and many players are from here.  You like being in rich people side? We got Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and Jack Nicholson.  You like being on poor people’s side?

"I never thought this day would come, but here we are. LeBron James is a Laker. 💜💛"
"Full article:  &gt;Since he was in ninth grade, Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving has had a relationship with LeBron James. Irving went to James' camp twice, and when he was sidelined with a foot injury at Duke, the superstar dispensed advice. When he was drafted by the Cavaliers a year after James left, he had to answer question after question about his mentor.  &gt;Now, obviously, the two are teammates and trying to win a championship. On Friday, Irving was asked if James is, right now, playing better than ever. He paused for a few seconds and then had whole a lot to say.  &gt;""I was just speechless,"" Irving said. ""I became a fan, to be honest with you. I just told him that it’s a different feeling when you’re on a team with someone that you’ve watched for so long. When you get to see them up close and the work that he puts in, the dedication that he has and the drive and the will that he has, he literally, I feel like we all just — we were together, I don’t want to say we jumped on his back, but we were all there for him. He was doing his thing, but I think the true testament of him is that he embodies a leader that leads a team.  &gt;""The true testament of the word ‘team,’ I feel like, is embodied with the guys that we have here,"" he continued. ""We have so many different personalities, so many different guys. When you have a leader like that that brings you up and lifts you up in every situation — there’s never going to be a time where you look at him and he’s going to look frazzled or look like he doesn’t know what he’s doing. He always knows four steps ahead and it’s just like, ‘Whoa, I wasn’t even thinking about that, like, what the heck? He saw that coming?’ So it’s just a learning experience and you’re just constantly, constantly on your Ps and Qs because he just expects you to be at your best, and he wants you to have your best.  &gt;""So if you have a guy like that, the basketball stuff will take care of itself. I mean, he does amazing things. I appreciate seeing that, I don’t take that for granted, but the nuances of the game that just go unnoticed sometimes, that not everyone can see or experience, it’s just a different feeling.""  &gt;Irving finished off by saying, ""Great speech by me, by the way. 'Cause it really came from the heart. Crazy."" He's right. Irving has spoken about the bond between the two of them on the court during this postseason, but he hasn't quite said anything like this. That's a heck of a quote."

"A bunch of my friends and I went to Vegas this weekend for my friends birthday, and decided to go to the Summer League game. Afterwards, we decided to go to the Wynn to play some craps. I saw Magic Johnson walking around which was cool, Magic gave me a head nod when he saw me wearing my new laker jersey as I was walking next to him (we were going the same direction, I hate bothering celebrities) but that was about it.  So then I’m playing with crap with my friends and about 30 minutes later, someone taps me on the shoulder. It’s Lebron James!He gave me a high five and said “hey man, saw your jersey, and just had to come over and say hi and wish you some luck. Thanks for the support, and good luck man!” And gave me some more dap. He seemed so happy and was smiling and seemed genuinely thrilled someone was wearing his jersey. His friends were waiting for him in the walkway to finish talking to me, so he definitely went way out of his way and made his friends wait to do this. My back was to him he easily could have just kept walking.  It seriously made my weekend, and reinforced my opinion of him and his personality. It was such a cool moment and something I’m not even sure I would have done if I was an NBA player. Many, many NBA players would not have been humbled enough to do that. Just wanted to share my story with you guys and how chill he was, and yes, it was lucky, I won my very next roll and walked away from the table a few hundred dollars richer."
"Link me the published article then, you're probably mis-remembering the one about LeBron. All we have are stories of NBA players touching the top of the backboard, no actual evidence. Dwight Howard was literally brought into Sports Science and they had him jump as high as he could and he was still 6 inches from the top of the backboard. And even if LeBron could do it he would still be a foot off from a 61 inch vertical.  If the highest recorded verticals in NBA history are only 46-48 inches I highly doubt there's anyone jumping 61 inches. It's such a crazy accomplishment that if it was true there would be more sources than just some old article that may or may not exist. I googled ""LeBron James 61 inch vertical"" and literally nothing about it is coming up so I'm starting to doubt it. If you link me some evidence though I'll be willing to believe it."

"&gt; Stop the bullshit and just argue the points. hurr you didn't watch the series hurr grammar hurr stan. suck my cock  Well it helps if can I understand the point. But it’s difficult with your poor grammar.  &gt; Anyways, I watched it again just for you. I do see Draymond keep his arms on his chest. However, it is still a clear moving screen not a normal screen. Stop sucking the Warriors dick and be fucking honest or don't respond.  Nope. Lebron James grabs green during the screen. This causes the movement.   How in god’s name are you trying to  argue what’s on the tape?   &gt;Lebron swung his arm but you're leaving out that Draymond chicken winged him first. You quote me saying it but never respond to that you biased liar. Draymond's chicken wing is what causes Lebron's chicken wing Dray was probably trying to bait Lebron and was ready to flop and he did. He initiated the illegal play.  Green extension is not even CLOSE to anything harmful, Lebron extending his arms and knocking down green was absolutely a technical.   Furthermore, are you refusing to see Lebron grabbing and pushing green in the initial screen?   Either way, Lebron instigated it  Either way, Green was not deserving  of a flagrant, Fucking clearly. "
"Yeah. It's not even just LeBron James. It's a $154 million asset for their franchise. Doesn't matter how egregious the allegations, they're gonna run their own investigation."
"&gt; I don't care about my grammar because I don't care about replying to you because you are just bullshiting.  LOL  You don’t care about replying to me, as you write a fucking essay to coddle Lebron  &gt; Lebron was trying to go through the screen. Draymond was moving the screen and forcibly trying to push Lebron out of Steph's way so they get tangled up and I think they both hold each other in place. Lebron is using his strength to stop Draymond from moving him while Draymond is trying to physically move Lebron. They get stuck in a standstill for a second then Lebron breaks loose.  Nope. Watch the video, this is just wrong.   Lebron grabs Green. Green’s arms are both seen on his chest.   Watch the video before commenting with shit.  &gt; Draymond get back to James and tries to chicken wing Lebron out of the picture then Lebron returns the favor. Draymond flops and lands on his bottom, Lebron steps over, Draymond extends his arm aiming for Lebron's nuts.   Green’s arms are extends as he tries to get up, Lebron steps over him. This causes green to create contact with Lebron.   This is 100% objective, stan  &gt; The illegal things Lebron did was hold Draymond and step over Draymond/talk shit. Lebron holding Draymond is not called because Draymond is also holding him so that's a no call.  Green was not holding Lebron. As seen by the actual video   &gt; Lebron steps over and is not called for anything. Draymond swipes and is not called for anything. The league reviews is and sees it in slow motion. Lebron is given a technical foul for the play, Draymond is given a flagrant. Well deserved for both.  So once again, you didn’t watch the series did you, buddy?   The refs called a TECHNICAL on both. Flagrant was called by NBA to lengthen the series   There was no possible way that was a flagrant considering Lebron instigated everything.     Lebron grabbed Green during a normal screen.   Lebron swung his arm  Lebron stepped over him.   Give me a break, you are seriously way too biased to have this discussion  "

"Since some of the potential mitigating factors when the Commissioner is deciding discipline are ""the player’s overall good character"" and ""the player’s reputation in the NBA community,"" you can probably safely assume LeBron James would get fined, maybe suspended, but most likely not get dismissed or disqualified from the NBA.

"&gt; Both players do it to each other though. you're so biased lmao  No. Watch it again.   Green extends his arm: This is legal  Lebron swings his arm: This is not leagal  These are really basic shit man.   &gt; They are clearly holding each other as both stop moving and their hands on each other. Then Lebron jumps away to contest Steph and the sequence continues.  Dude, did you watch that video?   Green's arm is literally visible on that screen, he wasn't grabbing Lebron, even if Lebron was grabbing Green, this would be Lebron's fault.   What are you talking about?   Lebron's arms are CLEARLY clinging onto Green on that screen. Green's arms are literally in nartual screening position.   Lebron was pulling green for no apparent reason. IN :02, YOU CAN SEE LEBRON GRABBING GREEN AND MOVING HIM.   Dude, you are having a hissy fit because someone objectively called out Lebron James. You commented atleast 20 times in this thread for utter bullshit, you are too biased lol "
"Of course, but no team is going to cut fucking LeBron James without their own investigation, regardless of #metoo."
"Okay, so I completely disagree with this entire comment, since you clearly have your head so far up Lebron's ass. So let's look at only the objective points the OP has brought up.  &gt; Yeh, because he was like Prime Shaq right? Real game changer. Even Javale McGee was with the Warriors longer and did more for them than Bogut. Fuck off   Bogut was the most impactful defender in NBA according to every single defensive impact available. it's hilarious that you are trying to ignore this:  http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2016/sort/RPM/position/5  Rapm also gave Bogut a huge lead.   &gt; Don't lie. He wasn't injured, just old, and worn out, but he was still great.  Nope, he was most certainly injured:  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/16/warriors-andre-iguodala-back-injury-game-6-nba-finals    So he was worn out but was injured in the early stages of game 6?   &gt; Yeh, this also shows you are one big imbecile. Green hit Steven Adams in the nuts, in the WCF. That was a clear cut blow, and he should have been suspended right then and there, but the league for some reason gave him another chance, and let him go with a warning. But dude did almost the same thing to LeBron of all people now, so he was suspended. I mean, he got suspended because he can't keep his hands and legs off of people's nuts. That's not ""bullshit"" kiddo. Stop being so delusional  Wow. How biased can you be?   Green hit Adams in the nuts, that is a completely different scenario from the event that transpired.   Lebron James used his arm to drop Green, the contact is made as Green gets up while Lebron **STEPS OVER** Green.   There's no possible way that was flagrant.   &gt; Why? Because he sucked ass? He sucked ass in 2015 as well. Then in 2017 and 2018 Durant covered him. But stop with the injury excuses just because he got locked down by Kevin Love and got outplayed the entire series by Kyrie. FYI, Kyrie was the one that was coming off a damn surgery, remember? Have you ever even played sports IRL? Nobody in the post season stays 100% healthy. So just fuck off with the excuses.   Wow. Sucked ass coming from a Lebron fan whose favorite player had choked in multiple occasions.   But let's go over it. In 2015, Curry apparently sucked ass. Wow.   Curry averaged 26 with 58.5% TS with 5 rebounds and 6 assist. That is sucking ass? Whew.   This is far higher than Lebron's average efficiency in the finals, but yes, this is ""Sucking ass""    Here's the problem, if Curry wasn't injured, how come he couldn't speed past slow immobile bigs in 2016 but could blow past the same player every year after that? Curry was smoking Love and TT in every finals outside 2016. Are you seriously arguing Curry's injury wasn't impactful? He had zero quickness.  &gt; This literally makes ZERO sense. At the end of the day, GSW had their 2 time MVP, 3 all stars. Curry and Klay was playing, and Draymond only missed ONE game. Andre was good, Livingston was good, and everyone of them played. Again, Bogut wasn't prime Shaq. Don't use that as an excuse   'Let's ignore Green's suspension, Curry's injury, AI's injury, and Bogut's injury!""   Let's not use context at all!  So yes, let's completely ignore the part where GS had to give minutes to a below average center defender because Bogut was injured.  &gt; Yeh, that's called ""momentum"", it happens when a team is making a comeback. GSW should have known better, they made the same comeback against OKC in WCF, and OKC crumbled. Then Durant decided to join that team instead, now that's the softest and most cowardly move in NBA history. But it is what it is  Wow, just wow.   You think it was ""momentum"" that gave each player on the Cavs a huge efficiency boost as their best defenders went down? Just wow.   &gt; Um, last time i checked, that same team won 73 games.. Are you saying just because Draymond missed ONE game, and fucking Bogut was out in the end, they were not the 73 win team? That team literally would have been the greatest of all teams if they didn't lose to Bron in the finals that year. And now, kids like you saying ""oh no, they were not a 73 win team, because Andre fucking Bogut didn't play"" LOL fuck outa here kid. You are just embarrassing yourself  Impossible. The way Steph was injured, that team had zero chance at becoming their regular season form. Especially now that AI got injured, AND Bogut, the most impactful defender in the league, was injured.   &gt; That's not saying much, but you love context? Here's a fucking context for ya. Bron was shooting 50% and above from the field regardless, while carrying the whole fucking playmaking duties as well. So fuck your delusional ""context"".    Fun fact!   When AI or Green was on the floor, Lebron's efficiency was below league average.   Carrying the whole playmaking duties? Really? Kyrie was absolutely dominating the ball when Warrior's defense went out.   Kyrie held the ball just as much as Lebron and was even more dominant in isolation.   Some more context for OP, point differential shot down when Kyrie was sitting on the bench in the nba finals  &gt; No it wasn't. Dirk was a GOD that year, no doubt. His one and ONLY great season. But he was surrounded by great pieces as well. But the Heat team that Dallas faced in the finals, was just newly formed and had chemistry issues. The Heat's starting Center was Joel Anthony. That team basically had 3 great starters, and just a non existent garbage bench. So that 2011 title was certainly not better than the 2016 one, where a 73 win historic team was destroyed, and a 3-1 comeback was made as well. Too much unrealistic shit happened in 2016 that will never happen again. So it's not even close. Bron's 2016 title was far greater  So first, this user is now claiming that season was Dirk's ""one and ONLY great season"". According to him, he was surrounded by great pieces despite RAPM estimate putting them far weaker than the Heat.   You know what's really funny though? You refused to admit Lebron choked hard in 2011, wow.   Wow. Just wow.   &gt; That's literally not saying much, because a 73 win Warriors team was also a far greater team to face than the newly formed Heat team with no chemistry or identity. 2012 Heat was a totally different monster, LeBron realized he's LeBron, and everyone had chemistry by then. So that's different   Yeah try again. RAPM, the best stat in the world, had a stronger differential between Heat and Mavs vs Cavs and Warriors.   You are really taking things out of your ass.  &gt; Really? So you wrote 8-9 horse shit comments, and then ended with this? That's just sad. LeBron literally had the block of the year, and arguably the greatest block of all time, which kept the score TIED, and then Kyrie's shot was actually a meaningful winner, because that score was tied. LeBron was carrying the whole offense, as usual. Scoring, and especially playmaking. Kyrie was the point guard, but he doesn't know shit about playmaking.   This is really funny. Not only are you taking shots at Kyrie, who hit the most clutch shot of the year, and who was more efficient with the same volume, but you are completely forgetting the part where Lebron missed. almost. every. single. defensive coverage in the half court.   Green's highlight for that game:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxA35eWJ4Ms  Green dropped 30+ because Lebron had no clue how to guard.  &gt; Your username says Im pretty real, but instead it should say Im pretty fucking delusional. You are by far the worst type of bias, delusional, disrespectful and imbecile hater that i have ever seen on this sub. Congrats kid, you played yourself. Delete your account fool  This is awful lol.  You are nothing more than an avid Lebron stan attacking pure stats."

"Chris Bosh never averaged more than 18 ppg on Miami after averaging 24 ppg the year before joining. Dwayne wades ppg average decreased every year LeBron was in Miami. Reaching 19 ppg in 2013 down from 30 ppg in 2009. Clearly these stars were in decline.   If you remove LeBron James from last years cavs team their offense would be equivalent to the Magic’s. LeBron literally carried that team on his back. They would not have even made the playoffs without LeBron. They swept the raptors, a 59 win team. The Cavs were such a shit team it is ridiculous to claim they had more talent than any team in the playoffs without LeBron. They just have the greatest player on the planet. That is why they won. The man had 8 40+ games. He averaged fucking 34 9 and 9. How can you not recognize how great this man is. He’s a goddamn monster. He literally played through a finals with a broken hand.

"I mean you’re saying that by logic of counting rings so heavily then bill Russel would be better than Jordan but clearly most people don’t say that and MJ is still regarded as the goat. So there is something else to it and not just rings. It’s just that when you get into that upper echelon you’ll find that the players for the most part all really good in multiple aspects of the game.  Jordan was a better shooter than Lebron and would feast from the mid range in what is generally regarded a much more physical and defensively tougher era of basketball.  Lebron has exceptionally high efficiency in scoring and coupled with exceptional court vision he’s able to take apart defenses without having to always score every single possession.  MJ was a better scorer being able to put the ball in the basket in a multitude of ways whether it baseline drives, fadeaway jumpers, pull up jumpers, circus shot layups, crafty post moves you name MJ got it.  Lebron is physically imposing and dominant he didn’t need to be crafty because his sheer strength coupled with his incredible speed makes him nearly impossible to guard.  The point here? They both make a valid argument for GOAT but they’re extremely types of players who’d played in different eras and under vastly different circumstances. It is extremely difficult to to pick either one as the definitive but here’s the thing. MJ was widely regarded as the goat. He was the king of basketball and he has sat on that throne for quite some time. It isn’t on MJ to prove his worthiness he already did that in his era. It is instead on Lebron to prove that he’s worthy to dethrone the king and that is a tall order to take on.  MJ has nostalgia and memory on his side. Many of us who grew up watching remember his highlights and his greatest moments not his weakest. So the you go look at stats but statistically he’s as great if not greater than Lebron.   It’s an argument that honestly won’t end until the old order dies off and the new order is able to crown a new king. And that king will most likely be Lebron James."

"LOLLL!! Miami isn't a super team and had two all stars at the end of their career??? Wade, Bosh and James were all in their prime and took paycuts to make an unfairly strong team because they couldn't win the honest way. On top of that they lost in the finals twice against teams with much less talent. This alone shows why Lebron can never be the goat.  The Cavs making the finals this year was nothing special. They were more talented than every team they faced and the only reason they beat Boston is because both of their top players were injured. "

"I think it’s a stretch to call Miami a super team. Two all stars, one at the tail end of his career and the other just leaving his prime hardly equates to a super team. The cavaliers were a 33 win team before LeBron joined in 2015 and they hadn’t made the playoffs since he left.  In those 8 years LeBron led his team past a championship Celtics team, swept the first seed hawks who had 5 players of the months on their roster, defeated a first seed bulls team with an MVP Derrick Rose, embarrassed the Raptors three years in a row, and defeated a first seed Boston team. So the “no competition” argument is moot. He did this with an admittedly great and developed team in Miami and a young, unproven team with two players, Kyrie and Love, who had never played a single playoff game.   Shaq won three of his finals on what is widely considered a top 3 team ever. He played with Kobe Bryant, a player most would call a top 10 talent of all time, and was coached by Phil Jackson a coach many argue is the best ever. After his tenure with the lakers the only team he won a championship with was the Miami Heat, the same franchise that LeBron won 2 championships with. Shaq averaged less than 14 ppg as Dwyane Wade took finals MVP after a monster 35 8 and 4 performance. This is not a remarkable finals win by Shaquille O’Neil. In fact, it’s worse than LeBrons worst finals appearance ever against the Mavericks which he is constantly attacked for.   Tim Duncan is an incredible player and I have no intent to detract from his legacy as I am a Spurs fan born and raised in Texas. I do, however, need to recognize the fact that he won his 5 championships with the most successful franchise the league has ever seen. With all stars David Robinson, Manu Ginóbili, and Tony Parker. And, probably more importantly, with the greatest coach in NBA history, Greg Popovich (my opinion). What Duncan achieved was incredible and he’s a top 10 player in my book but there’s no way he could have led the teams LeBron led to 8 straight finals.   No player in NBA history, short of maybe MJ (but maybe not tbh) could have led this years Cavaliers to the finals. LeBron James is the most dominant force is NBA history and his achievements should not be diminished. "

One of the 10 greatest to ever do it. There are a number of ways to make him look good, but comparing him directly to LeBron James is not one. If I were you, I would get over whatever personal feelings you have towards LeBron and be excited that you have the best player in the world on your team for at least 3 years. Just my $0.02"

"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this.""  it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.

Personality flaws? LeBron James?  Are you high?
"Great Lebron can get to the basket and score efficiently. That doesn’t make him a great scorer. Lebron James is a facilitator who can use his freakish athleticism to get to the bucket; that does not make him a scorer.   You could pick anyone playing defense from any era and Kobe will still put up buckets that’s a scorer. If you did the same to Lebron and forced him to shoot from the outside, I know he can score from outside but it’s where he’s least efficient, he’ll still score but not nearly at the same clip.   You can say that it’s inaccurate and post statistics all you want, but the way scorer should be defined Lebron James is not a scorer, he’s a facilitator who scores. "

I would need to see how tall and what his weight was at the beginning of high school but I think around then is when I wouldn’t be able to beat him.   Edit: if LeBron James jr is any comparison he is 5’4 and 97 pounds. I could back him down and I’m taller by 4 inches. Idk if he can but I wouldn’t be surprised if he can dunk.

"Don't let this be some final judgement of character on these guys, but I've run into a lot of NBA players in LA, and here were my experiences with active players:  **Stopped for chats or photos with fans:** Dwight Howard Kevin Durant Jimmy Butler Paul George Draymond Green DeAndre Jordan Kemba Walker Lance Stephenson Rajon Rondo Jeremy Lin Brook Lopez JJ Redick JaVale McGee Luol Deng Chandler Parsons Jordan Clarkson  **Acknowledged fans but did not stop:** LeBron James Dirk Nowitzki Russell Westbrook Klay Thompson Kevin Love Pau Gasol Trevor Ariza Tyson Chandler Larry Nance Jr. Ed Davis Timofey Mozgov   **Did not acknowledge fans at all:** James Harden DeMarcus Cousins Carmelo Anthony Blake Griffin Kyrie Irving John Wall Kyle Kuzma Joakim Noah Morris twins Kendrick Perkins Julius Randle D'Angelo Russell"
not according to any of the coverage i have seen. woj and other sources always explicitly state the lakers.    https://www.express.co.uk/sport/othersport/982343/LeBron-James-Los-Angeles-Lakers-Kawhi-Leonard-San-Antonio-Spurs-Adrian-Wojnarowski-NBA  
LeBron James  Jimmy Butler as a Bull   Kobe Bryant   KD as a Thunder pooed on us 
Yeah but we got Lebron James in exchange so I’m not too worried about losing Randle lmao
I mean this man boomed lebron james. He’s so good.  So that part is fair.
"The gym clothes aren't the point, they're just a part of the whole thing. If he'd just been in a regular pose and maybe holding a basketball while wearing gym clothes it would be less jarring because he's an athlete and she's a model and they specifically mention models and athletes on the cover. [Here's every Vogue cover from the last 17 years](http://voguescovers.blogspot.com/p/vogue-us.html). Notice how every single cover model is depicted except for LeBron James. Vogue doesn't do covers like that. The *only* time they did it was with the first black man on their cover. [Here's a video of some of the photo shoot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtnOVLWMkYU) You'll notice most of the shots in the video look like any of them would be a normal Vogue cover. They chose *that one*."
"And he's still only 5'7"". It's not like he took them and became Lebron James"
Because it's a team sport and great individual performances do not always result in wins (Exhibit A: LeBron James in game 1 of the finals)
Never forget the refs changed a charge call into a block call on LeBron Fucking James in Game 1 of the NBA Finals with 34 seconds left and the Cavs up two and gave Durant 2 FT's for charging. 
"For reference, some other NBA 2K19 ratings:  Ben Simmons - 87  LeBron James - 98  Edit: Um... why is this being downvoted? There's literally no opinion in this comment lol"

"&gt;When we look back on this era, we're going to remember one thing   That Lebron James/Dwayne Wade/Chris Bosh wasn't enough to take down Dirk &amp; co."

You won't be able to talk about the era without discussing both. Warriors needed a vastly better team to down LeBron James but James and a very good Cavs team in 2017 get swept aside is still a factor.

It doesn't have to always be about beating LeBron James. Their org is smart and make Smart decisions and is well coached. They don't care who their opponent whether be harden or LeBron or Davis. They want ringzz and more ringzz. It's LeBron's era tho can't deny that. But everything isn't about LeBron James

"Kyrie is better than Russ vs the Warriors, specifically. Sure. He also played as the sidekick to Lebron James, which is weird you don't really factor in as being beneficial. The gap between Bron and KD, especially his last year on OKC is extremely wide. "
He was the primary defender of John Wall and Lebron James in his first 2 playoff series. Pretty crazy to think how affective he will be when his offensive game becomes more polished 
"I've got one problem:  LeBron would not retire that soon.

Abernathy ""Sprite"" Winchester becomes the first 50% robotic player in league history, and proceeds to flop on every play. The league adds 2 expansion teams, the Dormdussle Auctioneers and the Austin Rebels. Ironically the Seattle Supersonics vehemently argue ""no more new teams!""

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Jayson Tatum.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Long Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Tatum's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SF ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever boom the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Jayson Tatum, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Tatum in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Tatum is so good. Tatum is so good. Tatum is so good. Tatum is so good.  You might be jealous of Tatum's ten fingers, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Celtics fan who watched basketball in the 80s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Tatum isn't even a top 5 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Tatum talk to the adults. Fair?"
"So a team with 4 all stars, two top 3 players, who kept livingston igoudala and bell and added the top 2 big in the league will lose to....  Lonzo and rondo who both shoot 31% from 3 and score less than 20 combined. Who are players that need the ball in their hands to be effective  Brandon Ingram who scored only 16 ppg last year  A guy who plays with an ankle brace  A shaqtin mvp who can’t play more than 12 minutes a game due to asthma  Lance, a blower who is a career 30% 3pt shooter  And a now 34 year old Lebron James  Not even mentioning time to build chemistry while this is the 3rd year of the warriors meshing  There’s a thin line between hope and delusion"
"I think Embiid is a very realistic dark horse for MVP next season, especially considering the case against other notable candidates.  Hear me out... voter fatigue and a general aversion towards superteams are very real and determining factors when it comes to the MVP voting. As a result, players such as James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant can likely expect diminished support amongst MVP voters in the immediate future.  An equally significant factor to winning the MVP award – barring some sort of statistical anomaly, such as averaging a triple-double – is team success, and very rarely does the MVP come from a team that finishes with &lt; 50 wins or outside the Top 4 teams in their respective conference. Subsequently, the case for players such as Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, and Karl-Anthony Towns becomes somewhat less conceivable for the 2018-19 season.  Therefore, the likeliest candidates remaining are LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, and Joel Embiid... I think it’s a given that LeBron will be the consensus preseason favorite to win his 5th MVP award, but if the Lakers fail to live up to their already lofty expectations and Kawhi/Kyrie are unable to overcome lingering injury concerns, I believe it is completely within the realm of possibility that a healthy Joel Embiid averages 25 ppg and 12 reb while anchoring Philly’s defense and leading the Sixers to the 2-seed in the Eastern Conference... Thus, rendering him the 2018-19 NBA Most Valuable Player.  (For what it’s worth, my second dark horse candidate would be Donovan Mitchell. I think it’s very possible that Utah could nab the 3-seed in the West while Mitchell builds upon his incredibly impressive 2018 playoff run, in which he averaged 24 ppg 6 reb 4 ast.)"

That 99%? Lebron James because his 4 year deal has no NTC
"To answer the question first, somebody hit the nail on the head when they said he got his own rebounds. That's half the reason Boston was able to control the games by winning possessions, even if they missed more shots than the other team.  Basketball is a nuanced game. Your greatness is measured by how great you did in your time, and how impressive that feat was.  Many things made his run a little less impressive compared to today but nonetheless, he was without a doubt the best of his time. You cannot argue his understanding of the game and that even today he would certainly be one of the greatest players ever.  A 6'10"" cannonball who plays with Draymond's tenacity, and Lebron James IQ. He would basically be a young Lebron James but better because he was a master of team ball.   Just imagine Bill Russell with today's sport medicine and all the scientist LeBron James has. Stop playing yourself if you don't think Bill Russell is solidly in the GOAT conversation. "

"I love basketball. It's impossible not to immensely respect Lebron James if you do. My only fear regarding signing him was that we'd sell the farm to get win-now stars, leading to some near misses at the championship and no future after the 4th year.  But he seems to be on board with the guys we have. This is pretty much the ideal situation imo. Lebron and the youngins. If we play everything right we should have a long championship window."

"This is such a bootstrap theory applied to basketball.   There is nothing the Pistons or Bucks can do to improve their respective cities lmao. The best they can do is build a winning culture and get lucky with loyal stars (OKC), but as we're seeing, even that isn't nearly enough.   ""It is what it is"" will ultimately hurt the league and it already is. People rush to point out national TV ratings to defend the state of the league, but local ratings and support are tanking. Most franchises are no longer profitable.   When everyone in Orlando is a Lakers fan in two decades, the NBA will realize SM franchises are literal dead weight and the league will be a watered-down product.   Ironically, everyone rags on the MLB, but it's in a good place for the opposite reason: national interest is low but local support is through the roof. That means folks won't tune into a Sunday night national contest but will watch most of their local team's games.   That's a blueprint for long-term relevance because it doesn't rely on the fickle mainstream attention span for buoyancy. If something supplants the NBA's eye-catching immediacy in the national eye (*wink wink* LeBron James' retirement), the league will struggle to keep its footing, just as it did in 1998 when Jordan walked away and the Bulls stopped providing the easy storyline.

"Tbh the only reason people don’t consider DeMar a superstar ( a legend already to the city of Toronto, a player who is a 4x all-star, and someone who helped lead the 2015-16 Raptors to the ECF ) is because he “chokes” to Lebron James every year in the playoffs but leads his past the first round every year.

"&gt;I just can’t wrap my head around why everyone loves Wiggins so much.  It's not that everyone that loves him so much, it's that people like you chronically underrate him, so he gets way more criticism than he deserves leading to a huge circle jerk on this sub, which causes a reaction pushing back.  He had a bad year last year, but he also had a bad year because he was playing behind Jimmy, at the beginning of the year when he was playing as the 1 option, and when Jimmy was hurt he did a lot better. They basically play the same role offensively and Wiggins was put in a bad situation to have success.   He is had a pace to put him among some of the best scorers ever (along with Booker). Wiggins is the sixth-youngest player to hit 6000 points. Those quicker than him were LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady. And Wiggins played a lot better defense last year, but no one on this sub actually cares. He will almost assuredly be a better defender than Booker in his career, and while maybe not as good of a shooter, people treat him like a bigger bust than Anthony Bennett. If you look at Oladipo, who should have been the number one pick in 2013, he didn't really show much in his first 4 years.  Basically people like to unduely hate on Wiggins so I'm not sure where you're seeing this outsized love for Wiggins on this sub."

"Ehhhh. Expectations were going to be there regardless because he's the kid of LeBron James and he plays basketball. Michael Jordan's kids weren't named after him, but when you're named after the best player of all time you probably would have pressures just being an accountant."
"In the future, if you act all cocky I would at least try not to be wrong   http://www.nba.com/2013/news/05/05/lebron-james-wins-mvp.ap/"
"I was responding IRT each team's lack of leverage. What matters is that both teams were capped out title contenders that had no way to replace the player if he walked.   Thompson was a starter on a title team with LeBron James in his 30s, on yearly contracts. Losing TT would have greatly hurt the chances of repeating, and keeping James. I'd argue that it's awfully hard to come up with a scenario where a team had *less* leverage than the Cavs.   And yet people have been complaining about that contract being an overpay from day one, as though there was a viable Plan B.   You make a good point that Capela is more deserving of the money than TT was though, fair enough. "
Who is Lebron James' dad? Is it Jimbo? Is it Ned? Could it be Mr. Brovloski? Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? 
So your only excuse is Lebron had worse teammates? Come on bro.  IF that is your excuse then Westbrook last year was better than Lebron.  Westbrook last year had zero All Stars on his team while Lebron had 2.    Yes KD is defending high caliber players. Lebron James.  Also defending Kevin Love who is one of the best scoring big men in the league.  Who was Lebron guarding?  Steph?  Hardly.  KD?  Hardly. Lebron was mostly guarding Draymond.  
"Sure, because in almost every other sport there is real competition for medals. Basketball is a team sport where almost all the best players come from the same country, and wleach country only gets to submit one team. The NBA MVP award has been handed out 63 times. Only 3 of those times did it go to non-American players (Steve Nash twice and Dirk once). If you write down a list of the best players on the planet, it is entirely possible that you will write an Olympic team's worth of Anerican players before you list a single non-American.  The last gold medal Melo won in 2016, the silver medalist was Croatia, who fielded 2 NBA players: Bogdan Bogdanovic and Mario Hezonja (not exactly HOF contenders). The US beat them by 30 points.  You can't just ignore the level of competition that they play against and pretend that winning Olympic basketball is the same as winning Olympic swimming.  Think about it this way, if Melo got his buddies LeBron, Chris Paul, James Harden and Anthony Davis together and decided to play summer league, how much would their inevitable victory mean to you in the HOF discussion? I ask because, realistically, there are a lot of summer league teams out there that would beat the Serbian national team, too. So, why is it worth more credit just because there is an Olympic banner on the competition?"
"Imagine Lebron at DE though. People can’t stop Von Miller and Lebron is bigger and longer and maybe faster   EDIT  Jadeveon Clowney, College DE phenom measures at 6'5 and 270 lbs. Lebron James is 6'8, 250 lbs. If he gained weight, which he would if he played football, he could be an unstoppable pass rushing machine without the danger being tackled violently due to his height and reach. "
"He's 34. He's not what he was 5 years ago, not what he was in Denver and he clearly thinks he still is that player. If he's not performing at the level he always did for those years and can't acknowledge that... he should just retire.  He's not LeBron James, he's not Wade. And I think he always compare him to those two, specially Wade, but Wade has 3 rings and he's an icon and an idol in Miami. Melo? Nobody wants him to be a starter, he's not an idol anywhere."
I hope LeBron James Jr and Cristiano Ronaldo Jr hang out someday
It wasn't just game 4. Going into game Miami had a 2-1 lead but lost the last 3 games. In those 3 games LeBron averaged 15.3ppg on 16% shooting from 3 and 40% from the free throw line with 14 turnovers. The worse part is in those 3 games the were  -41 points with James on the court an +19 with James on the bench. They literally would have been better off benching him in the Finals

"on top of that, you get a high five from lebron fucking james bc he recognizes how much you're killing it. whatever happens in the rest of this kid's life, he has something to tell his grandkids that is pretty badass.  growing up, the pros, especially the best ones weren't out there like this. pros felt untouchable or god like. the level to which players involve themselves in the lower levels of the game today is incredible and will only lead to better and better ball players."
"1) Chris Paul (Hornets) Doesn't hurt you from anywhere. Provides elite defending, playmaking, shooting, basketball IQ, clutch gene 2) Dany Green (2012-2014) Elite perimeter defending and shooting. If the Spurs won in 2013, he would have made an argument to win the FMVP 3) Bruce Bowen Another Spurs legend who knows how to shut down the perimeter while spacing the floor (39%). Has won 3 championships with 8 defensive team honours.  4) LeBron James  5) Marcin Gortat (PHX) Fantastic player who played within his means. Steve Nash transformed him into a 15-10 guy, while adding a solid defensive presence in the paint. Also productive and efficient at the same time.    Probably still not enough to defeat two MVPs and two other All-NBA stars. "
"It's because you can't just look at advanced stats to determine the value of a player. For example, if you just looked at Real Plus-Minus which is considered to be a pretty good advanced stat, and didn't watch basketball, you would think that Robert Covington is the 8th best player in the league, Lebron James is the 12th best player in the league, and Otto Porter Jr is the 13th best player in the league  Edit: to be clear I think jokic is an elite player, but just explaining why he may be rated lower than his advanced stats would indicate "
"I get what you're saying... But to say Michael Jordan and LeBron James just need a basic understanding of the game, and what sets them apart from local rec league guy, I could never disagree with more strongly. LeBron is an absolute genius. When you're talking about the top players in the sport is definitely a mental/competitive side to them that separates them, and it also separates 99% of nba players from the general public. Apart from 7 footers like Roy Hibbert who first picked up a basketball at like 16.   I don't disagree with your argument that you can make it in soccer by being unathletic just because you have a good brain, and that isn't possible in bball. But I completely disagree that you just need a basic understanding of basketball to succeed. Understanding the diversity of screens, cuts, double teams, staggering and split second adjustments doesn't require a basic level of understanding. I feel like the majority of nba fans don't actually understand the complexity of basketball. They just see tall black men who come across as meatheads, but when you realise how much strategy is behind playing just defence, I could never say that all it takes is height and athleticism."
"Ron Harper, Rip Hamilton, Lebron James, Tony Kukoc, Shaq  That team has everything."
"i have a friend who used to play the highest levels of dutch youth basketball. he says that being a good basketballer basically comes down to being tall, strong, jump high, etcetera. he's cool with that because he's 6'8"". skill can make up for some of it, but you'll never find a small unathletic guy in the nba. there was a video of a guy recently who absolutely styled on some defender in a 1v1 drill, but hes too small and doesnt jump high enough so he'll never make it. in soccer, players like xavi are small, unathletic, slow people whose physical capabilities were somewhere near a good amateur runner. but he was a genius who could read the game better than anyone else. youll never find anything like that in basketball  if youre michael jordan or lebron james, you need a basic understanding of the game but thats absolutely not what sets them apart from your local rec guy. you can find people with nba minds on the streets, youll never find someone with a champions league mind on the streets... if they had that mind, they would be playing there."
"Oh really? Now you want to start to draw differences between situations? There's such a huge difference between Karl Malone and Lebron but we can't say there's a difference between KD and Lebron. Because that's just fucking ridiculous.   That's precisiley the point. We're all gonna sit here and say everything that KD is totally okay because ""Lebron James did it first"" but I can't point out that Karl Malone did this shit 10 years before Lebron ever did it but somehow it doesn't apply.   Fucking ridiculous. "
Jason Terry averaged more points than LeBron James in that series
"""Lebron James regrets having kids"""
"Jrue Holiday, Rip Hamilton, Lebron James, Kevin Garnett, Rasheed Wallace. My team has floor spacing, unselfishness, high basketball iq, trash talking, and most importantly, we won't have any problems switching on defense."
Just a reminder that LeBron gave himself the title of King James
"This list is just straight up terrible. I really hope you do learn a little more before you speak on this subreddit because you’re speaking against people’s favorite players, so keep that in mind. The fact that you don’t have any reference as to what you’re rating them as best of. Best of what? Steph curry is no where near the impact on basketball as Jordan. 6-0 in the finals. Averaged playing with only one all-star team mate a year as to where steph curry AND Lebron James average higher than that. Lebron James also has like what 3 rings lol.   Carmelo Anthony with 0 championships and a very terribly developed game is better than Tim Duncan who won 5 championships over 3 separate decades? Dude the list is just plain out inaccurate. "
Bro imagine you’re a high schooler playing ball and fucking Dwyane Wade and Lebron James stand up and cheer when you do something 
"This year is a Lakers team hyped as fuck for Lebron James and a Clippers team lacking even a fringe all star level player, it's going to be bad. "

"Man, no offense as this is not my intention, but I got kinda sad to see the '(explained further in tweets)' with no links/transcripts of them whatsoever. So, if you don't mind, I'll post all them all in here for others who can't access/search all of this that easily.  Twits explaining:  &gt; In response to some questions about passer rating, here’s a thread about the history of valuing assists, how passer rating was born and what it captures. (Links at the end) #thinkingbasketball 1/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; I’ve always been disappointed in assists by themselves - they need context when used to measure impact or skill. Assist:turnover ratio was often cited in the past, but it’s not always helpful. 2/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; A previous (unpublished) version of the passer rating regression actually pegged ast:tov as a slight *negative* — too much conservatism might indicate an unwillingness to try risky passes that are high ROI. It’s the dink and dunk of quarterbacking for basketball. 3/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; The aim of my first major passing study in 2010 was to divorce assists from “shot creation.” For example, Brevin Knight crushed MJ in assists, but Jordan created far more shots for teammates by causing the D to react. This led to the birth of BOX CREATION. 4/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; The key insight from box creation was that too much scoring cannibalizes chances for teammates (bc the defense reacts to the threat of a scorer with doubles and stunts) BUT, too little scoring and the defense won’t react. There’s a balance at the heart of offensive stardom. 5/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; The ability to quantify creation gave birth to a more comprehensive version of usage called OFFENSIVE LOAD. Load includes passing &amp; creation, not just shots and turnovers, so it estimates a player’s total “direct involvement” in the offense. 6/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; In 2017 I started tracking detailed passing tendencies for players. It’s hard to reduce passing to one dimension or an overall score, but I think of it as the composite of all the possible types of passes. eg outlets, lobs, skip passes, touch passes, etc. 7/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; PASSER RATING is an attempt to measure this overall passing ability. Few if any excel in every component of passing, and time and circumstance will influence passing ability. The key insights of passer rating are: 8/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; First, a high ratio of assists to load is a major indicator of passing skill. The more a player accrues assists per involved-possessions, the more likely it is that he is finding the easiest shots for his teammates. 9/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; The second is obvious - layup assists are generally an indicator of good passing. They are the highest EV spot on the court and finding them regularly *as a percentage of one’s overall assists* is generally a positive. It indicates less dink n dunking to outside shooters. 10/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; There also seems to be a relationship between height and passing (cue @ZachLowe_NBA ). Specifically, when the other signals are strong and the player is tall, he is almost always an excellent passer. 11/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; I do think there’s a positional bias in the current version — guards pick up more idle assists — that I haven’t been able to adjust for but would like to in a future version. For now, I recommend some mental curving for tall, efficient guards who grade out well. 12/14  &amp;nbsp;  &gt; Finally, my aim was to create something historically retrospective.

"I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it's un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in ""experiments."" read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now.....  until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..

"Ok, seriously, why do people on here seem to feel like a College title and hanging out with the best players in the game while they beat up on Euroleague teams means something?  Robert Horry has 7 rings and isn't getting into the HOF. Why? Because he was a good role player, but not the main reason his teams won. Do you feel like Melo is the reason that a team featuring LeBron, Durant, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Kobe, Kevin Love, Anthiny Davis, James Harden, etc was able to win a tournament where most teams couldn't put together a starting lineup of current NBA players?

"I don't completely discount the opinions of NBA players, but I do notice that they tend to overrate the individual parts of the game (1-on-1 scoring and isolation/post defense) and underrate the more team-oriented parts of the game (help-defense and spreading the floor).  Also, I didn't mean that a team wouldn't draft a player like Carmelo, only that a team wouldn't trade away significant assets to move up in the draft to get a Carmelo-like player. Take the last two drafts, for example. The Mavs traded up for Doncic because they basically thought they were getting a less athletic Lebron James. The Sixers traded up for Fultz because the comps for him were a [James Harden-Russel Westbrook hybrid](https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2017/05/17/nba-comparison-markelle-fultz/). If I told you as a GM that you could trade me some of your best assets for the chance to draft a player who would be a great scorer, but would play bad defense, be at best an average passer, and be a bad leader and locker room guy, you wouldn't jump at the opportunity.  You're right about the 30 years thing. It's more rhetorical than substantive, but I was reponding to what I perceived as rhetoric."

"bro, in 2012-13 the only reason he wasn't MVP is cuz LeBron James exists. He averaged like 29 ppg that year and they were the #2 seed in the East. Melo is ass now, but lets not act like he isn't an all time great scorer. Dude has averaged over 20ppg every single year (except last year). Peak Melo was pretty unstoppable offensively"
"Damn! That’s JUST like KD roasting little kids on IG and YouTube and Twitter his whole entire career!   Also, he was asked to answer the question he didn’t seek out everyone mentioning “LeBron James” and responding to the ones he doesn’t like."
"""His lone appearance off the bench came on December 11, 2007, during his first stint with the Cavaliers. James had missed the team’s previous five games with a sprained left index finger and made his return on the night in question to help spark the Cavs to a 118-105 victory over the Pacers.""   In context, Anderson Varejao was coming off of an injury, I think LeBron wanted to support him by coming off the bench with him at the same time."
LeBron James was born after I started paying attention to the NBA. I'm not buy his jersey because of it. Weirdo...
"Or ya know, the Lebron James Jr"
"random question, but can you imagine what it would be like to have lebron james as a resource if you were trying to be a pro nba player from a young age? imagine all the knowledge bombs lebron drops on him. kid has access to nba-level advice and insight whenever he wants it. question is, does he want it? there's also probably a dynamic of ""i want to be good not just because i'm the son of lebron"", so maybe he doesn't even want his dad's help. who knows."
"In case you’re wondering, LeBron James started in 999 of his first 1,000 career appearances. His lone appearance off the bench came on December 11, 2007, during his first stint with the Cavaliers. James had missed the team’s previous five games with a sprained left index finger and made his return on the night in question to help spark the Cavs to a 118-105 victory over the Pacers. It was the only game in his career in which he didn’t start.  Tim Duncan started in 998 of his first 1,000 career games, with one bench appearance coming during the 2003-04 season and the other coming during the 2009-10 season.  Former Trail Blazer Buck Williams rounds out the top five, as he too started in 998 of his first 1,000 career games.  In case you’re wondering, Russell Westbrook came off the bench the first 17 games of his career, so he won’t be joining the list. Kevin Durant and Chris Paul could, though.

Lakers literally added Lebron James 
I feel like some of the younger players will be added.  Guards: Kyrie Irving Damian Lillard Victor Oladipo  Wings: Devin Booker Kevin Durant Lebron James  Kawhi Leonard Kris Middleton Jayson Tatum Bigs: Andre Drummond Kevin Love Myles Turner 
You shall hail to the king James and we will shun you on /r/lebron if you do not
I remember reading somewhere that Bronny didn't want #6 or #23 because he didn't want people knowing who he was. But then again his name is LeBron James Jr. lol 
You see this is why I like Kevin Love.  You never see LeBron showing some James to Love and Russ.  Edit: how does this have upvotes
"Let's see the starting lineups those teams would have  * **Team #1**  Cousins, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Westbrook  * **Team #2**  Al Horford, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Steph Curry  * **Team #3**  Drummond, Lamarcus Aldridge, Lebron James, Klay Thompson, CP3  Yeah, I'd say each of them is better than Spain/France/Australia"
LeBron James
"And somehow it was totally cool for everyone to shit on Lebron James for the last 10 years for doing it but all of a sudden KD does it and eveyrone just says ""Well Lebron did it so it's okay.""  Y'all a bunch of salty little bandwagon hypocrites. "
"Easily the Lakers, they only had to not fuck up completely and landed LeBron James "
"Lebron James is the exact kinda athlete people talk about whenever they want to declare all athletes role models.  Not everyone is up to be a role model, and some understandably dont want to be. LeBron James tho worthy enough to be considered is a role model for so many children."
"LeBron James, despite being a great figure, cannot really change the real.  It takes way more than him to affect a major country like Brazil's currency.  "

"Here's a quote from Lebron from that very interview and I think it does a great job of summing up what Trump ended up doing with this dumbass tweet, but also what we should be striving for --  &gt;""He’s dividing us,” James said of Trump. “And what I’ve noticed over the last few months, he’s kind of used sport to kind of divide us. And that’s something that I can’t relate to, because I know that sport was the first time I ever was around someone white. I got an opportunity to see them and learn about them, and they got an opportunity to learn about me and we became very good friends. I was like, wow, this is all because of sports.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;“Sports has never been something that divides people,” James said. “It’s always been something that brings \[people\] together.”"

I think that Lebron James guy plays but I’m not sure.
"&gt; Lebron is a huge name in the world he's got alot of influence. Don't use that he's a private citizen excuse.  He is a private citizen though.  And sure, he's got a lot of influence, and several followers, but he does not represent a *fucking country*.  &gt;Sure it was articulate but he's basically blaming the whole situation on trump which is really stupid.  It wasn't just 'articulate'.  It was an actual point.  Again, Trump's tweet was literally just insults.    Oh, and I'm not going to get into the whole BLM thing, because that's obviously not the issue at hand here, but I think it is fair to say that Trump has gone out of his way to involve himself in (and frankly to further politicize) the NFL kneeling issue.  Lebron's interpretation is not one that is unique to him, frankly, and an actual statesman's reply would have included reasoning showing why Lebron's interpretation was wrong.    Trump, as I think is very clear at this point, is more Twitter troll than statesman.    &gt;I'm not okay with everything anyone says   You say that, but you're literally defending Twitter insults.  Here, lemme quote the Tweet:  &gt;Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!   Zero acknowledgement of the issue at hand, zero attempt at anything resembling a rebuttal, just an insult.    You are defending that. You are defending schoolyard insults over rational discourse.  You are defending Twitter trolling over actual logical discussion.  So you say you're not okay with 'everything anyone says' but it frankly seems to me like your standards are very fucking low.  Again, you may not agree with what Lebron said, but he at least had a point.  Not just insults a fucking 6th grader would find immature."
"White guy here. Of all the players in the NBA I think he's the best role model for my kids. I was a fan of his the first time I saw him play on ESPN but that was because he was a joy to watch as a basketball player. Seeing how he's matured through the years as a man and as a father is what sets him apart for me now. It's in his words, and more importantly through his actions. And he is sled aware enough to never slip up in front of the media in spite of all the pressure that comes with being LeBron James. And... He brought home a 'chip for The Land! "
If I had the same platform as Lebron James I’d be screaming fuck Donald Trump at the top of my lungs
"I didn't say what they are doing is illegal. It is immoral. Big difference.  They are playing you for fools and you happily accept it.   Hell, what I'm I even talking about... We're talking about people (more like sheep) who take political advices from Lebron James... Fucking Lebron James... The dude who does not even have the [basic education](https://i.redd.it/xp66s4y6dboz.png)...  This is beyond a fucking meme... You lot are just looong beyond saving. It's sad really."
"“Attacking our president with childish insults,”  “Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do.”  Hmm..."
"&gt;	If white kids grow up saying they want to be like Lebron, they’re far likely to end up adults that are racist.  Clarify this for me. Are you saying white children who grow up idolizing Lebron James are *far likely* to grow up to be racist? Did I misread that?"
"The class act that LeBron James is with so much money and fame is astounding. Being married with the Mother of his children and having zero affairs, when he could literally commit infidelity with Beyonce is a prime example of a individual who carries himself with such strong self control and discipline. The great love and attention that he pays his own children by encouraging them to fulfill their dreams with a blueprint that took LBJ many hardships growing up to develop, is inspiring to any hopeful first generation millionaires who wish to hand down to their kids the fruit to their labor. His legacy will be know by my kids since I am a basketball fanatic and have always admire his behavior on and off the court. Ever since my love for the game was birthed and I’ve discovered his tremendous work ethic he has been a great role model for many minorities who’s voice aren’t heard in this country. "
"Lebron James embodies everything America is supposed to represent. He's been in the public spotlight for nearly 2 decades and yet he's never been less than a good, kind, intelligent person who makes a positive impact on the world.   I'm fucking proud a person like him is the face of the NBA."
"Trump always attacks black people, calling them dumb, sons of bitches, insulting black countries, and more. While he is willing to say there are good people in white supremacist movements and actively refused to denounce them. This is a pattern going on for years now, and if you haven't realized the way he treated black people in his tweets compared to white people he is talking about I don't know what to tell you  Edit: [here are things he has said about black and brown people (paraphrased) over the last few years to deny their Americanness, play into racist stereotypes of low IQ or black countries being full of AIDS and more](https://twitter.com/keithboykin/status/1025735810342178816?s=19)  &gt;In Trump's World:  &gt;Obama: Kenyan  &gt;LeBron James: dumb  &gt;Don Lemon: dumb  &gt;Maxine Waters: low IQ  &gt;black countries: shitholes  &gt;black athletes: SOBs  &gt;Black tenants: unwelcome  &gt;Black workers: lazy  &gt;Central Park 5: guilty  &gt;Mexicans: rapists  &gt;Muslims: terrorists  &gt;Indians: fake  &gt;Nazis: very fine people"
"LeBron James is a national treasure. He’s also one of the most wholesome public figures. I can’t think of another celebrity, athlete, or politician with less skeletons in their closet. This man has had all eyes on him since high school and hasn’t slipped up once in the 15 years he’s been in the NBA. I’m glad nasty words from trolls like the president haven’t been able to deter the King. "
(For people over 50) do you know Lebron James ?
"It's funny because you're defending a man who has no skill whatsover and is a millionaire getting richer from his position.  Lebron James, on the other hand, worked his ass off to be a GOAT contender and is funding for schools himself."
"LeBron ""DeMar DeRozan"" James"
"if you think an NBA player like Lebron has no power, then you're blind to the path we see so many people walking on just this sub - professional athletes on the scale of Lebron James wield an incredible amount of power. Now, it's not the same as the President, of course, you are correct in that"
How stupid do you have to be to talk shit about LeBron James? Pretty sure this dude has A LOT of fans

You're confused. Obama never went out of his way to tweet retarded things like Trump does.  He insulted Steph Curry and NFL players. Obama never did.  https://www.vox.com/2018/8/4/17650982/trump-lebron-james-tweet-don-lemon
"""Mr. President, what are you doing attacking Lebron James? He's one of the most influential athletes and is from the most important state in the electorate college!""  ""It's okay, *throws hands up* they're eating it up."" "
Are we just going to pretend that LBJ has not been attacking President Trump for about 2 years now.  This tweet is in response to a CNN segment where Lebron I painted the N word on my own house James accused Trump of being a racist for 15 minutes straight.  
Lebron James is a good human! 
"Overheard in the White House after the CNN LeBron James interview ”He got me” said Donald Trump of Lebron comments. “That Fucking James boomed me” Trump added, “He’s soo good” repeating it 4 times. He then said he wanted Lebron added to the list of people he wants to rant about on twitter this summer."
"Let's not forget, now, that LeBron James is fixing [a mess that John Kasich made.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/02/10/the-education-mess-in-ohio-under-gov-john-kasich/)  (That link may be paywalled, but should open correctly in Incognito.)"
"&gt; Also how the fuck is the president of the United States involved in a public twitter beef with LeBron James?  Because 1/4th of the nation is illiterate, half the nation is racist, and 1-2% are stupid rich and hate taxes / a nice society.  Also let's not forget the archaic racist voting structure that places farmland over real people.   Or the fact that republicans spend billions to shut down voting process and propaganda. "
"The best President of all time, insulted lebron James (after he insulted him) and were not allowed to discuss it.  There you go, fixed the title."
"Lebron james personally attacked the president and he's not allowed to defend himself, ok as usual a double standard"
Today we are all LeBron James
"I didn’t say that. You asked me why LeBron isn’t dumb, and I answered. It’s not my fault you’re insecure about LeBron James’ success and brains. "
Are we just ignoring the fact LEBRON JAMES STARTED THIS?  Edit: the circle jerk is strong. How about you guys educate yourselves. 
"Well the thread isn't just a random LeBron appreciation thread, it was made in light of the President's comments about James"
"I grew up watching Michael Jordan. I idolized him as a basketball player, imitated him on the court. He was my favorite basketball. When this young kid came out of high school into the NBA. I thought he was just hype, he haven’t really proven himself in the league. Just another kid making millions without having proven himself. I watched him here and there, and I thought to myself he’s no Jordan. Than I saw a man who was dedicated to his craft. Who loved the game. I was impressed with his work ethic, but what impressed me most was his demeanor off the court. For a kid so young to be thrust into the spot light at such a young age and to be able to stay out of trouble and be a great ambassador to the game, who cares, gives back to the community and is outspoken about what he believes in. That’s what impressed me most. Jordan was a great basketball player. Lebron James is also a great basketball player and a great human being. He is now my favorite player. "
"LeBron James is more than just an athlete, he is an American icon. He is one of the many faces representing our country and he has repeatedly shown that he is up for that task. While constantly under scrutiny he continues to be the same man of integrity and charity from practically the start of his career. We should all be so proud to have a fellow citizen like LeBron James. "
"Lebron James stood on stage with Hillary Clinton in Ohio trying to help her win the election.   Lebron James was the one who kept attacking the President in the past 2 years since he's won the election.   The Warriors refused to go to the WH and follow tradition because they felt like they had to be political, and Lebron James also stated he wouldn't visit the WH.  President Trump punches back, as he so often does, and NOW everybody wants to talk about respect and decorum and being models for kids, etc. Lebron James treated the President as a punching bag, and now that he punches back, everybody is clutching their pearls.   You all are sad, as are these NBA pearl clutchers."
"Honestly fuck the mod team for how they handle stuff like this. Either ban politics on the sub entirely, or do your damn job. Or - even crazier - let shitty comments get downvoted and trust your community to have a discussion about how batshit insane it is that the President of the United States is tweeting insults at LeBron James?"
"I thought, given his style of play, that LeBron James would be out of the league or, at best, a bench player by time he was 31."
"You say that in a thread that is primarily based on LeBron James providing education, food, and transportation to under privileged kids. Oh, he's also providing job training to parents of those kids.   Ya, LeBron is ridiculously wealthy. But he's donated millions upon millions of dollars.   Trump meanwhile takes money from his sham of a charity to pay off his personal and business debts."
"Think what you will about his on court legacy, but the fact remains that LeBron James used his influence to benefit people other than himself. Class act."
Much of the LeBron James Family Foundation’s money comes from his own personal funds. I doubt the $41 million was entirely from donations.
"I can’t even imagine the mental gymnastics one has to go through to think LeBron James was racist to poor old Donald Trump.  Unless you think “bum” is a racist term for White people, or LeBron saying Trump is a bad President is racist, which if that is the case, makes you the biggest snowflake in human history."
"LeBron was someone that, when I was a kid growing up, he was the man to look up to. A role model and example setter on how young, professional athletes should act. Even in my late 20's, I will tell you LeBron is still someone I look up to. This man has done almost everything perfectly. From remaining out of the tabloids and the gossip shit, to being constantly humble about his life and his achievements. Watching him become a dad and raising his son has been incredible to watch. I really mean that. For a man who never had a dad, to being at all his kids games, cheering and coaching like he's one of the parents is icing on the cake.   I swear, there hasn't been a more professional black athlete than LeBron James. I'd even go as far to say as there hasn't been an athlete period that has done what LeBron has. "
This season of America has been heating up.  We’ve now got a surprise “the president vs Lebron James rivalry” going on.  
"Lebron James is genuinely one of the most exceptional people I have ever seen. To come from where he has come from, to deal with all the fame and hype he has dealt with and to still become the person he is today is amazing. The fact that Trump decided to attack him after he had just opened up that school in Akron is an embarrassment "
What’s up with LeBron James cult of personality lately? Is he running for President?
"Kyrie Irving had a 61% true shooting percentage last year. He has had two other seasons at better than 58%. The point is: He is not a just a volume scorer, he is an incredibly gifted, highly efficient volume scorer. For some context, there were 3 players in the entire NBA with a TS%&gt;60 &amp;&amp; USG%&gt;30: Lebron James 62.1%, James Harden 61.9%, and Kyrie Irving 61.0%. If you lower the USG threshold to 29%, you add Steph Curry (67.5%!), KD, and AD to the mix.   To your point, the Celtics were about 4 points better on defense with Kyrie on the Bench. But they were 7 better offensively (per 100 possessions). Also, when considering the on/off splits you have to figure that one of Kyrie's replacement players is Marcus Smart who is on the short list of the very best defenders in the league at the guard position."
"LeBron ""My Body Is Work"" James"
Lebron James is a better human being than an athlete.  I respect the shit out of him and he’s one of America’s greatest citizens ever. Dude deserves to be on a coin or something.
"The whole of r/nba is a LeBron James Appreciation Thread, there was no need for this."
"The same as usual. Commentators riding the tide with no respect for the spectator's memory.  LeBron James' a top passer in the league, but saying he's the highest IQ in a league or he's the best 3p passer *bar none*... The name that always comes to my mind: Rajon Rondo. He's easily the greatest mind in the game, even though there are others, and the best 3p passer... I dunno.  The point is that is not *bar none*. There is actual debate for both claims (Harden just came to my mind. His job's literally passing 3 pointers).  But yeah, LeBron is easily a top five passer in the league (Rondo, Rubio (?)...) and one of the greatest in history. Same for IQ."
This whole sub is already a LeBron James appreciation thread
"Thank you. They have no fuckin clue how child support works. You're supposed to keep up the child's standard of living, which when you're an NBA player is really high. My dad never paid child support, and it still makes me mad.   Also how the fuck is the president of the United States involved in a public twitter beef with LeBron James? Crazy times."
"\&gt;That's why he was elected  No it isn't. It's common knowledge he lost the popular vote. Less people are Trump Supporters than not.  \&gt;That's why he's polling at over 50%  No the fuck he isn't.  \&gt; He's literally a dick to anyone that doesn't have our country's best interests at heart.  You don't think Lebron James wants the best for Akron? Cleveland? Ohio? The country?  People judge you for being a Trump supporter because the vast majority of the world believes Trump supporters are the same type of hateful asshole that he is. I'm not saying you are one, in fact I can tell you're not. But many are. More than any supporters of any past candidate. "
No one is saying it's trumps fault. Reading comprehension should be required to post on this site.  People are saying that there Are more important things Trump can be doing than tweeting bullshit about LeBron James. 
omw to vote for Lebron James as future President tbh
John Snow and LeBron James were bastards. Look how that turned out for them
"What if those meets Trumps pro black quota so he can point to those and say ""I'm not racist, I think Lebron James is a good person"" "
"&gt; I mean, I fucking hate LeBron James with a passion  In fairness, I'm like 99% sure you mean on the court. It's really hard to have an argument that LeBron is somehow a bad person off the court. Dude's a model citizen and a great example of your power and wealth for good"
LeBron James trumps all. 
"Lebron James  Oh sorry mods, you gonna delete this? Stop being pussies."
What a joke... something major happens involving the Lebron fkn James and THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES and the mods won't even let us discuss it... 
What's strange is Trump has several tweets from many years ago [lauding LeBron James...](https://twitter.com/DannyDeraney/status/1025624924088459265)
tbf trump calls out most people for their politics regardless of what their skin color is. he insulted as many republicans as he has democrats. also its funny how me saying lebron james is more than just a black man got downvoted
"I mean, I fucking hate LeBron James with a passion and he is not the GOAT, but tonight...for some reason...LeBron looking pretty good."
I love LeBron James.
who gives a shit what Blake Griffin pays in child support?  I wanna discuss the *President of the United States* tweet about LeBron James.  
"Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!"

Lebron James got trump! Trump lebum

"Sight, have you actually gone to any of those countries?  I’ve gone to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. They know LeBron as a basketball player. Not this great philanthropist, shit the reason why they’re those articles is because he’s a basketball player doing great things.  You guys get to defensive when it comes to ball. Look I like basketball, but to deny that right now Drake edges him out just because his music reaches a wider audience is silly.  For example, my grandma doesn’t know who the fuck is lebron James, but she sure is tired of hearing her greatgrand kids listening to Drake   Edit: really bringing up the beef with the president? You do realize the world doesn’t revolve around the US right?"
Lebron James is 2nd behind Mike James
"Lebron James was just boomed on by the greatest rookie on television, Jayson Tatum. He made Lebron look soft, which isn’t easy to do. He’s so good!"
"fellow Lakers fan, white President calling two black men dumb on Twitter. Very obvious and clear racism. Now, was that his intent? Who knows. We know why he hates Don Lemon, but why belittle the intelligence level of LeBron James? Just the usual perception that athletes are just hood rats with low IQ? Oh but that's racism too!"
"Lol ok, the 70 yr old white dude in Arkansas who only listens to AM radio is gonna know Drake...Lebrons reach is so much further. Olympics, clothing, movies, shoes.

LeBron James was born in December of 1984. Since then he's won more championships than your franchise.
don't mind him lol. Music is easily more worldwide just due to being more accessible and Drake is far more popular. You can go to a random country in Africa or Europe and people there are more likely to have heard Drake song on the radio or at a bar then to know Lebron James. He also has the girl fanbase along with the boys. You can buy imported or bootleg Drake cds in poorer countries but you can't buy imported nba games tapes showing Lebron. 
It’s fucking midnight and the president of the USA is taking shots at LeBron James. What the actual fuck
trump is so fucking childish. he can’t take the tiniest amount of criticism without going on a twitter rampage. and of all people: lebron james? jesus christ come on 
/r/nba mods really removed a tweet by the president attacking lebron james... 
"This is so fucking crazy. Lebron James, a man who has been universally lauded by nearly everybody in the world the last week for using his money and influence to seriously impact the lives of hundreds of at risk children, was just called dumb by the President of the United States. "
LeBron James calling Trump a bum was a greater accomplishment than the entirety of Michael Jordan's athletic career all together.
"All hail the NBA prophet. Just curious, what team will draft LeBron James jr?"
Yeah pretty much everyone knows who LeBron James is **without having to watch him play**. That's my point. So it's not as simple as music is more popular than basketball. Do I think it plays a factor in it? Obviously. But it's not solely contingent on that fact. 
PG: Chris Paul  SG: Kawhi Leonard  SF: Ron Artest  PF: Lebron James   C: Tim Duncan   Having two of the most intelligent defenders at the point and protecting the rim. Lebron can play a very destructive free safety role. Kawhi uses his length and agility to stifle Klay while being a still excellent help defender. Artest can use his strength to bother KD and maybe get into his head with his antics. They can switch any action 1-4 and trap/double and recover fairly easily when necessary because of the athleticism on the wing

The president of the United States called LeBron James dumb because he said some critical but in no way out of line things about him. He also keeps whining and trying to hand out discipline on Twitter to football players for taking a fucking knee. And the athletes are the precious princesses who need to grow up? Trump is as soft as the toilet paper Melania uses to wipe his fat ass.

"Man if he pulled up for a shot and missed, you know people would be shitting on him. ""Lebron James a good passer? Missed wide open back door cut pass for game winner"". Just recalling from my memory Iggy was sagging off and shadowing lebron so he couldn't drive into the lane. Passing was literally the best option, he wouldve been triple teamed had he drove to the lane, unless youre doubting one of the greatest BBallIQs ever. Im not talking about Lebron vs Kobe being a better scorer. "
"All I said was that this was the only link that posted credible information. Quoting the article:   ""This is a public school,"" Akron Public Schools spokesman Mark Williamson told PolitiFact.

So by law, the LeBron James Family Foundation cannot fully fund the school if it wanted to.  Even if the 20% isn’t partially true. It’s still true to an extent that Lebron could only fund a percentage. That’s the point I’m getting at. "
"LeBron shot 13-for-21 (76.6%) for 32 points when being guarded by OG last year  MVP James Harden shot 2-for-17 (11.8%) for 10 points when being guarded by Smart last year  Smart's unquestionably a better defender than OG, but Marcus is also a guard and not a wing, which kinda makes him ineligible for this question"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody try and claim that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant or even a more laughable claim, that Lebron James is a better scorer than Kobe Bryant I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?  "

It's LeBron Fucking James. Where *wouldn't* he fit in?
"No.  It does not make sense.  &gt; Crediting Defensive Win Shares to players is based on Dean Oliver's Defensive Rating. Defensive Rating is an estimate of the player's points allowed per 100 defensive possessions (please see Oliver's book for further details). Here is a description of the process (once again using LeBron James in 2008-09 as an example):  &gt;  Calculate the Defensive Rating for each player. James's Defensive Rating in 2008-09 was 99.1.  The defensive rating is just points given up per 100 possessions?  Or where does this value come from?  &gt; Calculate marginal defense for each player. Marginal defense is equal to (player minutes played / team minutes played) * (team defensive possessions) * (1.08 * (league points per possession) - ((Defensive Rating) / 100)). For James this is (3054 / 19780) * 7341 * ((1.08 * 1.083) - (99.1 / 100)) = 202.5. Note that this formula may produce a negative result for some players.  So we take the % of minutes played and multiply that by the total number of defensive possessions the team has played to get an approximation of the total defensive possessions that player has played.  We then multiply this by another approximation of how many points per possession the player is generating on defense.  This is taken as 1.08 times the league average minus the actual defensive rating.  So if the league average is 1 point per possession and the player has a defensive rating of 100 (league average), they get a value of .08.  This then gets multiplied by the minutes, so that the more minutes you play at league-average defense the more DWS you rack up.  &gt;  Calculate marginal points per win. Marginal points per win reduces to 0.32 * (league points per game) * ((team pace) / (league pace)). For the 2008-09 Cavaliers this is 0.32 * 100.0 * (88.7 / 91.7) = 30.95.  We can ignore this if we're only comparing players from the same season.  But it's an estimate of how many defensive points you would have to generate to create, on average, one win for your team.  &gt;    Credit Defensive Win Shares to the players. Defensive Win Shares are credited using the following formula: (marginal defense) / (marginal points per win). James gets credit for 202.5 / 30.95 = 6.54 Defensive Win Shares.  Divide.  In summary DWS is just the player's defensive rating times number of minutes played."
And why do you believe LeBron James does not have that?  What specifically have you seen from him that indicates he does not?

Kyle Singler - LeBron James 
"I think the MLB (and NFL) a poor comparison for NBA models, because an outstanding star's impact is considerably more important in the NBA than the other sports.  A real NBA lineup consists of 5 players who play both offense and defense, and can have the ball at any time on offense. Having a top 5/top10 player is so critical.  On the otherhand, an MLB roster consists of 9 men on defense, 7 of whom barely touch the ball. There's only 1 player on offense. The pitcher only plays 1 out of every \~4 games.   Having the ""Lebron James"" of baseball can only carry you so far because MLB James has so few opportunites to actually play the game, whereas NBA James is a central part of the game for \~40 minutes , every game"

"The eye test for fans is overrated because we aren’t as good at analyzing the game as we think we are. I think advanced analytics are the most reliable way to judge players, though they have outliers, it starts to become decently accurate when you incorporate multiple factors... The eye test shouldn’t be completely ignored but it’s not as important as many people claim it is in my opinion cause a lot of people like to act like their eye test is more reliable than every other factor when it clearly isn’t... The eye test may be better to see potential but not straight up production.   Edit: FWIW I made a stat combining multiple advanced stats together that had the most accurate looking league leaderboards and I think it came out pretty decently:  1. James Harden 11.12  2. Stephen Curry 9.69  3. LeBron James 9.61  4. Anthony Davis 9.11  5. Damian Lillard 8.68  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 8.15  7. Jimmy Butler 7.99  8. Chris Paul 7.73  9. Karl-Anthony Towns 7.53  10.

Kemba Walker 4.87  19. Kevin Love 4.73  20. Rudy Gobert 4.68  It’s definitely not perfect but I think it has a better leaderboard than any singular advanced stat does... I’m not sure what I could do to improve it but it seems to favor low usage centers too much and hurts centers with high turnover rates and not-elite efficiency."

"&gt;That's new info. Do you have a source for that? The part about the school not existing without Lebron and other sponsors funding 20% on top? Thanks  Actually, yes. [According to Politifact Ohio](https://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2018/aug/09/wannabe-entertainment/lebron-james-i-promise-school-wont-cost-taxpayers-/) the iPromise organization ([a part of the Lebron James Family Foundation](http://www.lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org/page/akronipromise#aipnoverview)) had been around for over a decade as a program spread throughout 32 elementary schools. As old schools in the area were being torn down, students from that program were temporarily housed in would become the current iPromise school.   [Last Fall, Lebron's foundation approached the Akron schoolboard with the intention of creating a new school out of the old building and it was approved](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21596361/board-oks-plan-lebron-james-promise-school-akron). Now, that same building got completely renovated and all of the students who used to be spread amongst multiple locations are all in one location --permanently. Additionally, the James Family foundation is personally funding things like GED classes for parents, job placement and the food pantry. How much they've spent so far is currently unknown.   &gt;People defend Lebron by claiming it would make it a private school if he funded any more. (WITHOUT ANY PROOF)  Within the same politifact article, there's a statement that reads ""Public schools are funded by the state, property taxes and federal funds. So by law, the LeBron James Family Foundation cannot fully fund the school if it wanted to."" So while we aren't told anything about the 20% figure, which should be fact checked, what is true from the post from a few days ago is the fact that they cannot fully fund this public school. I don't know what % it's being capped at, but the claim that there is *A CAP* because it is a public school is not a lie.  Look I say all of this because I see there's a ton of misinformation and sourceless claims that are harming the story more than they are helping. Reading into all of this suggests that LeBron and his foundation are much, much more important to this school than ""Oh he just donated 20% of the funds and that's it."" No, it really looks like this has been a long, long time coming and it stems from LeBrons own foundation.  I dislike the attempts by some on this board to diminish the contributions this man and his family have put into this. "

"That fucking monster!! Also lol how many people are gonna downvote this thinking it's an Anti-LeBron article, when in reality it's disproving all the bad stuff about what's been said?   &gt; According to the LeBron James Family Foundation, the $2 million figure floating around the internet—the share they are providing—comes from an early estimate regarding start up costs and is likely to increase once all of the first year contributions are tallied. The Foundation also says that the number may change annually based on community needs.  &gt; Contrary to the click-baity headlines, though, the public school will not incur “additional costs” compared to other public schools in the district, Akron School District spokesman Mark Williamson tells TWS Fact Check. “The cost is no different [than] what they were already investing in these students when they were spread across our 32 elementary schools,” Williamson says. ""Nothing changes in our costs of educating our students simply because they have moved from one building into another.""  &gt; What do the foundation's donations cover? “Extra costs are supported by the foundation,” Williamson remarked. Some of those “extra costs” include covering uniforms, food for families, career placement services, a bike and helmet for each kid, and transportation for qualified individuals.   &gt; Suggesting that “taxpayers [are] stuck with the lion’s share of costs for” IPS is no different than saying “taxpayers pay for public schools.” The Foundation is focused on additional services to students and families, not funding the cost of running a public school."

"Yea that’s another thing that kinda annoys me about this story. Not trying to diminish ether because I don’t hate Lebron like a lot of people (just pretty neutral on him) but it’s just a lot of misinformation in the coverage of it.  His foundation os paying for it. He raised money and surely contributed on his own but Lebron James’ charity is gonna have a ton of donors, corporate and individual.   Then, while it’s an amazing thing, it’s not some trailblazing move. A bunch of athletes have opened school before"
Lebron James has a highly skilled network of people who manage his narratives on social media (and push them in traditional media).
"Is anyone asking the important question?  ""Would this school and the opportunities within it's walls exist without LeBron James?""  I'll wait."
"It even says it's a joint venture in the first line of [his website](http://lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org/page/ipromiseschool)  &gt; COMING SOON The LeBron James Family Foundation and Akron Public Schools have partnered to design a brand new school for the public school students in Akron who need it most. A culmination of years of on-the-ground work and research-based interventions through LeBron’s I PROMISE program, the proposed I PROMISE School will be more than a 1st - 8th grade academic institution. It will infuse APS’s rigorous curriculum with a STEM, hands-on, problem-based learning focus with LJFF’s ’We Are Family’ philosophy to create a complete wraparound for its students and their families.  Anybody blaming LeBron is ridiculous. They misinterpreted the news story, and are blaming him for their misinterpretation."

"That definitely makes sense. I know Portland was the highest seed, but I think the interesting argument about that #5 spot in this hypothetical playoff comes down to a few things:  1. Should Portland get it because they had the best record? 2. Would OKC get it because of star power? 3. The voters would have probably overlooked Utah even though they were on a tear at the end of the season, especially defensively with Gobert healthy.  4. The voters would have probably overlooked Indiana and New Orleans as well. Interesting considering NO ended up smashing Portland, and Indiana nearly upset Cleveland. 5. Does Cleveland get it because LeBron James?"
"Somehow the rock-bottom ""Lebron James is doing a GREAT thing for his community"" is becoming a convoluted web of sensical nonsense.   It's now one of those moments where I understand where folks are coming from as they're looking that gift horse in the mouth to ensure it's not ill or really a donkey of a gift....but I also feel like we're getting close to that edge where we really wanna find a smoking gun to say ""AHA! THIS IS REALLY A (MARKETING SCAM) AND IS A SHAM!!!""  Lebron is sparking a conversation and that's what I think he was hoping to do....it's just that it's not turning into a productive one. It's turning into a cynical one. One where folks are not asking why their communities are failing educationally and what they could do in a small way to be like LJ...but why he's not giving more potentially and ""what about the other districts????"""
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Mel Daniels.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mel in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Mel's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest C ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Mel Daniels, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Mel in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Mel is better.  You might be jealous of Mel's three rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in ABA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Pacers fan who watched basketball in the 70s, or a Muskies fan who watched basketball in the 60s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Mel Daniels isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Mel Daniels talk to the adults. Fair?  "

"CP3 isn't out of it yet. I'll copy and paste what I posted in another recent thread below:  His advanced stats are literally up there with Micheal Jordan, Lebron James, Wilt, etc. He's underappreciated. 6th in all time player efficiency rating, 13th in all time steals with everyone above him retired, 9th in assists currently, 4th in all time Offensive Box Plus/Minus, 12th in Offensive Win Shares all time, 19th all time in win shares, 1st in Career Win Shares Per 48 Minutes...above Micheal Jordan at number 2, 1st in all time offensive rating."

"&gt; Aside from the lebron james and kds of the sf world his assist numbers are great. right in line with someone like kawhi leonard.  His apg numbers look only a little worse than a lot of SFs because he plays for Thibs. Per minute, his assist numbers are atrocious.   And Booker gets a pass for low efficiency because of a complete lack of offensive help. Booker takes some bad shots because they're the best shots his team's going to get. If he doesn't improve his stats while Ayton plays like KAT, then they're comparable. 24 ppg on 53% TS when your team has a player scoring 25 ppg on 62% is not good. "
"Well for one, scoring and shot creation.   While he had a down year with butler this year, the previous season he averaged 24 points on .534 ts.   Generational scoring talent Devin booker averaged 25 on .561 ts this year.    Then we have everyone else on this list hovering between 11-17 ppg.   Secondly. Andrew wiggins is extremely durable.  The best abillity is availablity and wiggins has missed one game in his career.      I dont think hes a terrible passer. Aside from the lebron james and kds of the sf world his assist numbers are great.  right in line with someone like kawhi leonard.     Wiggins is not a great rebounder part of that though is because minnezota is one of the few teams who run 2 traditional bigs and have an oldschool rebounding system.    While his defense is average to below average i dont think that negates all the things that makes wiggins good."
"Holy smokes. Check out the vein on Lebron's left leg. The one on his calf? I know you see it. Now, some of you might think that vein is a coincidence, that this slimy tube carrying the King's blood is just happenstance in this snapped photograph. True fans no better. A vein above time? Or, maybe, vain above time. Think about it. This is the key to knowing Lebron's future. Vanity over time. The fork and knife are here to distract the masses from the goat's heart. I can see you connecting the dots in your head. Naphrons and Sutrons or whatever the fuck are springing back and forth between your synapses as it all clicks into place. Lebron chose Los Angeles, a lifestyle, over the ticking clock of his prime. The chance for rings. Right? Wrong. See that glass of Rose? You're focused so much on detached crust you can't think straight. But us true fans can see: the glass is over half empty. Lebron doesn't believe in basketball. He's proven himself time and time again only to hear he's still coming up short. He's done. It's over. Now, you're scared. I get it. What will Lebron do without basketball? The signs are here, and us true fans can see it. Look above the glass. That green stuff? You guessed it. Grass. Lebron James is going to start a lawnmowing business. It all comes together. The chosen one from the day he could dunk, Lebron was pigeonholed into an illustrious basketball career. And it has never been what he wanted. Us true fans know: Lebron will start a landscaping company. His dream is complete. "

Just listing accolades tells very little of the story.   http://www.backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/  This article lists good reasons why.   Also he definitely should've been all-NBA defense a few seasons like 2016, where his defensive production was right up there with Kawhi and Dray, defending like 600 FGs and holding people to WAAAY below their average percentages as well as having excellent help D, but didn't get into any defensive team thanks to a narrative and looking at team defensive stats.

"Having Lebron hanging around would really help my anxiety too.   Imagine being a little kid scared of the dark, and Lebron James, this giant, this sweet man, saying ""hey I'm just in the next room, not going to let anything bad happen to you. I promise."" A more peaceful sleep would not be possible.  And I kind of feel like that kid sometimes. The world is scary and we're all going to die one day. What does that even mean, when I'm dead where do I go, was I ever anything at all. If a lamp stops working, the part of it that worked doesn't move on to another plane of existence. What if we're more like that than we think, free will is an illusion, we are vessels of guts that stop working, that's it. If free will is an illusion then this whole stream of my consciousness was meant to come out of my hands onto the internet, does it even matter that there was a person behind me sending it out.   Humans are so small in any cosmic sense, in any sense of time, and we'll all kill ourselves with nukes or global warming soon. But we get to live at the same time as something as dumb as basketball is reaching its prime, and providing joy to millions across the world in a shared passion.  And I'm glad two guys that some others liked to say had some issues were able to benefit from knowing each other, outside of the money, the fame, like in a real sense, as whatever human beings are, gain value from their relationship. Real value.  Sleep well tonight ya'll. Good people are out there watching out for you still."
If you trade away LeBron James I’m non ironically accusing you of corrupt backdoor dealing. 
"Curry. Look at what he's doing to defenses. The only way teams beat him was by dry humping him with 2 or 3 people.  And even then the Cavs were very close to losing. People will look at the numbers and say Curry was bad that series, however the Cavs entire game plan was guarding Curry and it worked. Harrison Barnes couldn't make a basket to save his life, Bogut got hurt which allowed Tristan Thompson to actually grab some boards and Draymond obviously got suspended. Basically everything that could have gone wrong for Curry went wrong and he still almost dragged his team to a championship against LeBron James and Kyrie.  With all due respect to Westbrook who had a great year, Curry had a better season in my opinion."
Lebron James caused me mental health problems after 2016 finals. 
No. I want that LeBron James narrative.

"Multiple players on different teams in the league have said how Russell has made his teammates better from his intensity and passion. That along with averaging some all-time stat lines, puts him above Kyrie in my book. Kyrie has had all the help in the world getting his ring so I don't feel like that should even affect the argument in this case. Not to say Russell's teammates are bad, but come on Kyrie had LeBron James "
"I have a friend who went to Lebron James camp in San Diego.  At the camp he played all the older kids 1 on 1 first to score wins (the kids would start with the ball).  He said no one scored on Lebron.  I don't know if there were 100 kids, but it included some very good players (including future NBA guys) so I don't think most of us would have a chance."

"2018 2017 2015 Warriors- mid tear draft picks plus superstar free agent signing.      2016 Cavs-  totally incompetent management lucked into a lot of high draft picks with absurd lottery fortune, the only reason they won the chip is because Lebron James is from Ohio    2014 Spurs - mostly mid tear draft picks, they tanked for 1 season in which they aquired Tim Duncan     2012 2013 Heat - free agent superteam   2011 Mavs - mid tier drafted superstar plus a lot of risky trades for veteran players    2010 2009 Lakers - smart trades and mid tier draft picks    2008 Celtics -  smart trades and mid tier draft picks    the key is not to draft highbut to draft smart and make good trades, unless youre Cleveland"

"Exactly. As an Indian who had zero exposure to basketball while growing up, I only knew 4-5 names even before I followed the sport. Michael Jordan, LeBron James,Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson. I got to know about every other superstar after reading up about the game. "
"Why are you talking about efficiency? That's not even the question. It's about age.  Kobe scored 60 at age 37.6. The next closed is at age 32 from Wilt of all people. After that it's 30. No one else in NBA history has scored 60 after age 30. So out of the 65 60 point games, only 3 of them are from players age 30+.   The difference from 37.6 to the next closest in 32 is insane.  Someone who's 37.5 years old right now is Pau Gasol. Someone who's around 32 right now is Lebron James  32 is the tail end of your prime, 37.5 is old man near retiring status "
"People are still on this stupid Lebron is not clutch narrative. In big games other than that blunder in Miami,game 6-7 Lebron is a monster. If I need a clutch bucket it's a couple players I'll go to before him but a clutch do or die game I'm going James."

"To every team that’s not the Warriors, Celtics, Rockets, Lakers, 76ers, Thunder, Raptors, maybe Bucks: You will not win a championship for the next 5-10 years.   Phoenix, Charlotte, Atlanta, Sacramento, Brooklyn, New York, I’m talking about you. You will also remain largely irrelevant and you’ll be lucky to make the news more than 4 times a year, unless one of your players murders someone.   In fact, every team that’s not one of those 8 I mentioned at the top, the only way you will find success and win a championship in the next decade is if one of you draft the next LeBron James and pull the next best 4 players from the league to join."
Lebron James will not go to the Memphis Grizzlies.

"This kinda shit used to be REALLY common in sports. There was famously the [10 Cent Beer Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Cent_Beer_Night) that turned into a full blown riot and yet Cleveland just did the same exact promotion a week later because well... shit happens at sporting games.  The reason you don't see anything like that with the NBA anymore is that Malice at the Palace happened in the era of Fox News. Fans got involved which made for great footage and you quickly had Fox with every single old white talking head rambling about ""these *thugs*, these *animals*, these *gangbangers* on the court! I can't believe these ni... black people don't realize they need to be rolemodels"" etc etc. All while of course replaying the event over and over while pretending to be appalled yet constantly saying ""can we see that again in slow mo?""  In the end it was good for the league and it's what's partially given us guys like Lebron James who do so much to combat racism in the US. Still it's easy to see the hypocrisy that fights in hockey and baseball get labeled as ""boys will be boys"" but if something similar happened in the NBA today Hannity would be burst a lung screaming about the ""Damn, unpatriotic *thugs* in the NBA""  TL;DR used to happen all the time but now is only tolerated in the white dominated sports."
"Sure, though no team is particularly enthused about playing LEBRON JAMES in an opening round/second round match-up."
"This is the same reason we can't say James or Jorden is the best player of all time. LeBron is still playing ball! His career isn't over! We can't compare them yet. (but its still Jordan. He was as famous as a Beatle. He changed the game of basketball. He back to back three-peats, and he moved like an angle. No one was more competitive than Jordan.)"

This show is a game changer I feel for African Americans   To have a mega personality like Lebron James acting as a role model and leader to talk about things that are important to him in such a way a lot of people will follow   depending on how deep they get into politics i feel like this show could legit swing an election 
"Miller was signed with the MLE, so that's a red herring. LeBron made $67M over 4 years in Miami.   His full non-Bird max would've been $72M. That's a rounding error in the grand scheme of things.

"Good timing? They had just blown a 3-1 lead against the cavs. The whole argument about the 2015 finals is that the cavs werent healthy. Boom warriors respond to that by going 73-9 and facing off against a healthy but inferior cavs team. After going up 3-1 they probably felt on top of the world, about to cement their legacy and prove the doubters wrong. And they blow it. That was probably the lowest point the warriors players had felt in a while. Its possible the cavs couldve continued winning championships off that momentum.. so Kd basically steps in to stop that momentum and here we are, lebron james plays for the los angeles lakers....."

Let’s say he came down and I got sucked off by one of the greatest players ever. Would that make me gay? Would it mean I had a “LeBron fetish”? No. It would just mean I gave the right answer to the question “would you like a blowjob?”  Most people would be fine with that. An NBA player that sucks your dick! That’s great!  Now imaging the same scenario, but it’s a guy you knew in high school who asks you if you want a blowjob. The right answer is still yes.  The answer is always yes. NBA player, woman, man, vacuum, etc. Get your dick sucked. It doesn’t make you gay.  And sucking another man’s dick is like changing the oil in your car.

"Saying the Warriors ""took it to Game 7"" isn't a correct sentiment. They went up 3-1 and had three opportunities to close it out.  The Cavs won all three, and (even if they weren't a 73-win team) the Warriors were the best team in the league.  Even the one game without Green they probably were. You're arguing as if they were a scrub team. Curry has never been confirmed (to my belief - correct me if I'm wrong) to have been injured in that series, and - even if he was - he still put up 23/5/4 so its not like he's a non-factor. The Cavs still had to play him like an MVP.  It's crazy to discredit the ""skill"" of a guy who averaged 30/11/9/3/2 for the series. Of course it won them the chip! They would have lost if not for his performance.  The Warriors not being at full strength was of course one factor. But its not the only factor; it didn't lose them the series. The play of LeBron James especially, but also Irving and the whole team, won the Cavaliers the championship. Every single Finals has its asterisks, 2016 isn't special; James and the Cavs beat the Warriors and deserve their ring."

"Sure, but that doesn't ensure future production.  Look at what his contemporaries are reduced to, he's already been elite ~5 years after everyone else fallen away.  At one end start with Kevin Durant in the 2007 draft and look back to LeBron James in 2003 and tell me who else between them is capable of being the best player on a championship team.    I don't say that to take away anything from him or not to marvel at what he did last season or will probably do this year, but to expect multiple years of this LeBron?   I feel like I'm taking crazy pills or being framed as a hot take artist for  advocating a player in his fifteenth year (plus playoff deep runs) maybe doesn't play as well in his sixteenth.  Last season took every ounce of LeBron to drag the Cavs to the finals.  Now every night in the West is going to be as tough as his road was to the finals. "

"Tony came in at 19 REALLY rough. His first couple of seasons he wasn't just not good, in the playoffs he was actually a liability. The Spurs don't win in 2003 without Speedy Claxton to hold things down at point in the Finals. (You can see this in their playoff win scores. Parker's was a below-average .063, Claxton's was .112.)  Parker became good, but he was never a top ten player in the league. Parker's peak was as a solid starting-calibre point guard who was able to overperform with Tim and Manu around him, because he'd been internalizing the Spurs playbook since the age of 19.  Manu, meanwhile, was top ten in WS/48 five times, top ten in box score plus/minus seven times, and top ten in VORP four times. He also has better plus/minus in the playoffs than anyone since 2001 except for Tim Duncan and LeBron James. Tony Parker is eighth on that list, in about 1700 more minutes.  You can say he was a perfect fit for his situation, but there's no way to support the idea that Parker was a skilled a player as Ginobili."
"Manu beat LBJ in 2007   Edit: They faced each other a total of 38 times in NBA games. Manu Ginobili has a 23-15 winning record over LeBron James, including a 11-5 record in Playoffs."
"Ehhh. I'll assume you mean the 2004-05 season, in which he was an Alll-Star and played about a dozen more games than the 2005-06 season. But even then, Manu was playing fewer than 30 minutes a game, in a league where minutes weren't *quite* as easily conserved as they are today. 29 minutes in 2005 would be like 26 minutes in 2018. But, putting that aside, in 2004-2005, this is what the rest of the All-Star teams included:  -Lebron James, averaging 27 pts, 7.4 reb, 7.2 ast, 2.2 stls, 19 years old when the season started  -Kobe fucking Bryant   -Kevin Garnett, reigning MVP  -Steve Nash, in the middle of the first of his back-to-back MVP seasons  -Tim Duncan  -Allen Iverson, scoring 30.7 ppg and leading the league in scoring for the fourth time in 7 years  -T Mac, who had just lead the league in scoring in back-to-back seasons  -Shaq, who led the league in FG% and was in the middle of averaging a twenty-point double-double  for the *13th year in a row*  -Prime Vince Carter  -Prime Gilbert Arenas  -Prime Paul Pierce  -Dwyane Wade  -Ben Wallace, in the midst of winning his second back-to-back pair of DPOY awards in 5 years  That's 13. I'll stop there, but there are more. Like Jermaine O'neal, at the height of his abilities. Or Carmelo Anthony, for example, who wasn't even selected to be an All-Star despite having averaged over 20 ppg in back-to-back seasons. Plus, all of the guys above were perennial starters playing around 40 minutes per game, or sometimes more (Lebron played 42.4 minutes per game in this season), every year. I like Manu but he was nowhere close to a top ten player. I don't even think he'd be considered a top twenty to be honest. He made the All-Star team because the Spurs were the best team in the league and because Pop was the All-Star coach, and I'm guessing he might have pulled a couple of strings. Same situation in 2011 if we're looking at this realistically.  Again, I like Manu, but all of this revisionist history to suggest he was one of the best players in the league for multiple years, it's just not true."
"&gt; ""I am a lifelong LeBron James fan, and a Lakers fan of a month and half,"" Riedel wrote in an email. ""I originally thought about turning Evan into a Nets fan for the torment, but I feel like he should be able to root for the King before he retires.""   Bronsexual confirmed "
"Winningest NBA player outside of NBA history too.  Just like how LBJ might have taken down the 73-9 warriors with their death lineup, but he's just the MANU of taking down great NBA teams.   Because Manu took down the 2004 US Olympic team with Carmelo Anthony, Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, prime Odom/Boozer/Amar'e, Richard Jefferson, Shawn Marion, Stephon Marbury, and coached by Larry Brown. That team so stacked POPOVICH was their assistant coach! Lebron beat GSW Kyrie/Love. Jordan 3-peated with Pippen/Rodman. Manu did it Luis Scola."
"if box score stat watching is all that matters, then can't you argue James Harden has been better than Lebron at any age?  Or Russ last year?  (i don't believe that to be true)"
"OP, you literally said this an hour ago in another thread:  &gt; What Lebron did in 2011 is literally the biggest choke in the history of modern sports. I cannot think of another Hall of Fame level player in any sport who choked for 6 games as bad as Lebron James did in 2011."
So you don't think mental illness can come and go?  I have friends/family who do fine for months.  And then all of a sudden break down.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't think Lebron has chronic mental illness but having bouts of depression is very common.  After the loss Lebron admitted he was depressed and isolated himself for 2 weeks  http://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/8034024/lebron-james-other-decision
Two weeks. Not sure if that is normal  http://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/8034024/lebron-james-other-decision
He isolated himself and was depressed for TWO WEEKS.  http://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/8034024/lebron-james-other-decision  That's not normal
Go watch his post game interview after Game6. That is the Lebron James we know.  Go read about what he did right after he lost.  He went into totally isolation for a week.  Those are classic signs of mental illness.
LeBron James go for 82 at a game with Kobe in attendance. The camera cuts to Kobe would be hilarious. 
It doesn't make sense.  Almost like someone took over Lebron James mind and forgot how to play basketball.  I think in the future we will find out Lebron had a mental breakdown during the Finals that year. Literally a medical condition.  If that's true then I will have to give him a pass.  Players get physically injured and we don't expect them to play at their peak.  Maybe Lebron was mentally 'injured' in the 2011 Finals?  If so he should get the same pass as a physically injured player.
"Miami Heat Lebron James was definitely a point guard.... with Kyrie he wasn't, with Lonzo he probably won't be, but over half his career he was a point guard. "
"Who cares what everyone else wants? He's LeBron James, he could do whatever he wanted and people would have eaten it up"
27 year old Kobe didn't have the biggest choke in NBA Finals history   What Lebron did in 2011 is literally the biggest choke in the history of modern sports.  I cannot think of another Hall of Fame level player in any sport who choked for 6 games as bad as Lebron James did in 2011.
5 seconds on the clock. LeBron passes it to Lonzo. Lonzo passes it back to James. Shot clock violation.
"I’m not a KD hater but the 2004 gold medal run will make Manu immortal. A legendary accomplishment. it will be retold and romanticized forever.     Ten years from now, you’ll see kids who never watched the game posting shit like:    &gt; TIL Manu Ginobili defeated Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and all-time great 8x CBA MVP Stephon Marbury to win Olympic Gold in 2004"
"Right....but you can't take their stupid naivety and act like that's THE predominant view of Wilt and then take the ""opposite stance"" and act like he would be trash today. He would still be a top 5 player in 2018 and would only be rivaled by LeBron James as the greatest all around athlete in the modern NBA.  "
Hes a more versatile scorer but not better.  Kevin Durants stats from his rookie year to his last year in OKC (9 seasons) when he had to score more: 27.4 ppg on 48/38/88 splits  LeBron James first 9 seasons: 27.6 ppg on 48/33/75   More versatile scorer absolutely but they are neck and neck in terms of overall scoring. 
TIL LeBron James used to play for Cleveland
Lebron was not better than Kobe in 06.   James didn’t have a consistent jumper nor did he start playing defense until the 2009 season. 
BREAKING: LeBron James is and has been good at basketball 
"&gt;But, until anyone without Lebron James gets close to winning a title from the East,  This could be said about 8/10 decent teams in the West. Only Houston and GSW have gotten close.  It's not ""the West"" dominating the East. It's GSW dominating the West and then GSW dominating the East.  GSW winning the chip doesn't make Portland, OKC or Utah a better team, that's not something they can hang on their mantle.  Besides GSW, only Houston would be considered finals contenders in the East right now."
"I get you saying that 2 of the 4 best teams are in the east. But, until anyone without Lebron James gets close to winning a title from the East, im going to still have the east asterisk there in the back of my mind.  That being said- yeah Boston looked like the fourth best team last year. And may be second best this year. Toronto we have to wait and see.  Im still more interested in OKC/UTA/LAL/POR- at least until the Finals get here."

Nick wright talk about anything other than lebron James 
#3 isnt right to me KD could do more with a garbage organization than AD could for sure. Youre taking a lazy playoff year as your evidence and ignoring the fact that the Warriors went on the greatest playoff run of all time just a year ago and before that KD was taking a Warriors team AD couldnt beat to 7 games. That was all in the past of course and AD has grown as a player but theres not a chance hes better than KD who some would consider even better than Lebron James. I respect the courage but I have to disagree strongly. I can get behind the first too tho
George Mikan &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lebron James
We would've won that series if LeBron actually played like he has been in recent years. I understand Marion was a top tier lockdown defender but it's LeBron fucking James. That's unacceptable.
LeBron James full-court shot against Boston in the 2006-07 season is the earliest thing I remember witnessing.
LeBron James is always a good candidate for MVP. But Blake Griffin at this point? Hell nah!
LeBron James Jr
Lebron James   James Harden  Demar Derozan   Kawhi Leonard 
"Easily my favorite Spur. His 2004 gold medal with Argentina in the Olympics is just as legendary as the man himself. Beating Allen iverson, Tim Duncan, Lebron james, Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade, Amare Stoudamire, pre Vaseline Starbury and more. Plus 4x NBA champ, Sixth man of the year (should have won more than one) 2x all star (should have been more). He was the definition of consistent. He had amazing touch and a great shot. He was a joy to watch, I’ll miss #20 on hard wood. GG’s Ginobili "
"I will always remember Manu as the team who beat Team USA in the 2004 olympics. He beat a Team USA that consisted of: Tim Duncan, Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade, Allen Iverson, Amare Stoudemire..."
Lebron James is the GOAT. The lakers will (probably) make the playoffs. But they are not better than the spurs 
Are we still underestimating LeBron James? lol
Lebron James
Lebron James
"If you think James Harden is the best shooting guard since after Michael Jordan played, then it makes sense. But that's quite a bit more controversial than what I'm saying. If you said LeBron James is the best player since MJ, I think we can all agree that makes sense.   Considering the most athletic player since LeBron isn't even that controversial of an opinion. You haven't listed anyone since LeBron that is more athletic than Zion. Griffin and DJ are way slower, don't jump as high, and Griffin is lighter. "
"As I said. You don't understand 'since'.  'Since' takes into account everyone that came after.  Yes Zion may be the overall most athletic player 'since' Lebron James.  That does not erase the intervening players between Lebron James and Zion Williamson.  Lebron&gt;Deandre&gt;Blake&gt;Zion  So Zion Williamson is not the accurate answer, in my opinion.  I hope I've cleared up how to use that term.   Thanks for your time."
? Zion is more athletic than all the players you listed. He's more athletic than anyone since LeBron James. I don't think you know what you're saying and I don't know how you're not comprehending this simple statement. 
Lebron James
Lebron James is good at basketball.
Lebron James will be receiving his 5th MVP
"Nah, nobody watches LeBron James in the playoffs, don’t be silly."
"No. Some alternatives:   Wilt Chamberlain 1961-2 averaged 50.4 points and 27 rebounds.   1966-7 he averaged 24.1 points 24.2 rebounds and  7.8 assist  The guy was also an absolute physical specimen at 7'1"" with an alleged 48 inch vertical and elite quickness and speed. He was like a thin Shaq running the fast break like Michael Jordan.  1988-89 Michael Jordan averaged 32.5 points 8 rebounds and 8 assists with 2.9 steals.  Most Jordan years are better than Curry's best.  Lebron James 2012-13 26.8 points 8 rebounds 7.3 assists (40% 3pt)  Tracy McGrady 2002-3 32.1 points 6.5 rebounds 5.5 assists (38.5% from 3)  Kobe Bryant 2005-6 35.4 points 5.3 rebounds 4.5 assists  Tim Duncan 2001-2 25.5 points 12.7 rebounds 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks. Tim Duncan's best season. He simply controlled games with pace and technique.  2016 James harden with 29.1 points and 11.2 assists  Julius Erving 1972-3 31.9 points 12.2 rebounds 4.2 assists and 2.5 steals.   There's been more than this  "
LeBron gets passes because he literally does everything on offense. James Harden gets critiqued the most.
"Rather, these analysts didn't know how unstoppable LeBron James is"
"LeBron James. And that's because of one of my basic sports pet peeves - I can't stand people who dominate based much more on athleticism and size than skill. He might be the best player, but he's just about a top-10 skilled player.   LeBron is not nearly as skilled a basketball player as Steph, Harden, KD, Kyrie, Kawhi or CP3, whom all I totally love. His modal scoring move is driving into the paint after a pick, which is not a good watch and infuriates me when he gets away with so many offensive fouls.  Note before stat-guzzling idiots reply to me with TS% -&gt; You're never going to find a stat that encompasses this. "
"&gt;The most iconic player is going to have a larger volume of both love and hate. Kobe had it Jordan had it. Him being more respected or winning a ship for Cleveland hasn’t somehow mitigated that.   Put Harden and LeBron in a vacuum and forget about how we’ll know they each are as players and where their legacy is in the history of basketball. Do this because you seem to be veering away from the point that this is about any player being hated. It has nothing to do with how we’ll know they are or how iconic they are. Kobe and MJ have no place in the direct conversation we’re having.  LeBron Hate - Super Team in Miami, left Cleveland before delivering on “the promise,” currently plays for the Lakers, has fucked the East sideways for 8 years straight, thinks too highly of himself, politically outspoken, and seems fake.  LeBron Love - Philanthropic, vastly improved the lives of kids and their families and future generations to come, genuine, came back and finally delivered on “the promise,” responsible for some of the best memes on r/NBA, incredible basketball player, and politically outspoken.  Harden Hate - Not fun to watch, allegedly hurt a lady while trying to cover for his friend in his entourage, tried to bribe that same lady with money, can’t score more than 15 ppg without flopping and getting to the line, flopping, doesn’t play defense, got his coach fired, is a bad teammate, passes people to ball before the shot clock runs out to avoid a turnover, doesn’t try, can’t win by himself, his playoff performances, his stepback, his arm hooks, and has never had a season worthy of MVP award.  Harden Love - Posters Draymond Green on a regular basis, his beard, strip club fame, his meme value, his 2016-2017 season, his demolishing of Wesley Johnson’s ankles and subsequent stare down, and his OKC days.  These are all things that I have seen upvoted, on multiple occasions, both positive and negative, about both guys. Just go search “LeBron James” and “James Harden” in this sun and sort by new. Even sort by most upvotes and you’re see much more positivity about LeBron and negativity about Harden.  Edit: Fixed a sentence."
Lebron James trying hard to be MJ 🙊
I mean sure Artest hit a huge shot that game and Kobe shot poorly but so did everyone else. And if we’re talking “salvation shots” look at Ray Allen and Kyrie’s shots. Those shots saved LeBron’s legacy. Now do those players’ shots take away from James’ greatness? NO. Because LeBron still played well and so did Kobe. He shot poorly but he still defended and rebounded well. Don’t disrespect a player just to boost another one up. I’m sure you feel the way you feel towards Kobe because of his stans and how they feel towards LBJ but most Laker and bball fans realize how great both players are
But LeBron Raymone James Sr. has more letters in his name than Kobe bean Bryant.  Checkmate
LeBron James easily
"It absolutely would not overcome the skill discrepancy. Stipe Miocic was much smaller than Ngannou and whooped his ass, Mayweather was smaller than McGregor and schooled him, cormier was smaller than Stipe and knocked him out, gaethje fought James Vick last night and was much smaller and knocked him the fuck out to the point where Vick didn't know where he was. LeBron also doesn't have the experience of going non stop for 5 straight minutes with someone trying to knock you out. LeBron has to take plays off to regain his stamina, you can't do that in a fight or you'll go night night. Once you get gassed you lose all that strength advantage. "
"fuck everyone on the spurs  fuck lebron james (the player, not the person)  as you can see i'm not very popular here"
How many players did LeBron James rob of a ring because he decided to form a super team and give Adam Silver a call? The 3-6 Mafia are ridiculous.
i ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE lEbRON jAMES AND HE IS MY FAVOURITE PLAYER BUT i THINK HE WOULD BE A REALLY ANNOYING PERSON TO GO OUT AND GET DRUNK WITH.
"Missing 5 shots is nowhere close as bad as missing ~20 shots. In this exact case, the cavs scored 33 points on 32 possessions. That's a 103 ORTG in comparison to OP's claim, which would give an ORTG of 0.   Also if you read the article, you would take away a few things.  1. The stats given on NBA.com were wonky. The writer acknowledged that himself, and there were positions were LeBron got the switch and scored on curry, without getting the credit on nba.com.  2. LeBron had to pass in most of those situations because of double teams that came his way. This doesn't mean that curry is a great individual defender, it means instead that GSW has the right pieces around curry to minimize the effects of these possessions.   3. The reason that the Cavs didn't score as much had to do with LeBron's teammates and them making shots, which wasn't the case a lot of times.   I'm not saying that Curry is a horrible defender. I'm saying that there is no universe in which LeBron James goes 0/20 when guarded by Curry."
"I can see game 7, but I don't know how people would begin to call games 5 and 6 chokes. Were we supposed to win with our 2nd best player suspended and starting center knocked out in the middle of the game? Were we supposed to win *in* Cleveland against Lebron fucking James with Bogut out and Curry in BS foul trouble? Game 7 came down to basically the last possession too even with all the injuries, it's not like we choked a lead or something."
Lebron james. I find it odd you can call yoursekf the king but lost 6 finals. I also dont like the excuse culture around him
Holy fuck he annihilated LeBron James
"Ditto. I know I should like him, he appears pretty chill, likes to smoke, doesn’t seem concerned about the fancy things in life. But that comment about LeBron fucking James, insinuating he wasn’t a “Man” and then walking off the court without saying anything was definitely not chill. "
"&gt;James has had 26 possessions with Curry as his primary defender in the first three games of the Finals, almost nine per game. These possessions have come primarily toward the ends of games, when James methodically slows the offense, points at Curry’s man, and calls for a screen, at which point the Warriors’ switching defense demands Curry switch onto James. In the 26 times this has happened, James has zero points. He’s taken five shots, missing all five, and he’s never been fouled in the act of shooting. This from a player averaging 37.7 points in the Finals—but, apparently, zero against Golden State’s worst defender.   So not 20 missed shots as the above comment said, but really that is just arguing semantics.  The takeaway is that on 26 one on one possessions, Lebron either missed a shot or had to pass away.  Above average defense I would say, as someone who both read the entire article and watched the finals.  "
This guy twitter bio says he’s a “lebron James insider” 
LeBron is a better James Johnson  Curry is a better Jose Calderon  Westbrook is a better Nate Robinson 
"smh, put Lebron in the league today and hes just a slightly better James Johnson "
"I find it frustrating reading through the comments people make about how bad an nba player is at a particular thing. Because it seems like no matter what the comments are always negative or about how bad a player is. Do you really think the best player in the league right now who is 6'8"" and strong as an ox still with elite athleticism couldn't guard most 4's(which he already does, watch a game and stop using 2k as a reference) and damn near all but probably the top 15; 5's?? I can't stand seeing hate posts on players who are way above average in the hardest basketball league in the world. Guys like serge get roasted, guys like whiteside get roasted. It's unbelievable how many of you are so quick to comment negatively and shit post a player. This is lebron James. Obviously he's not gonna guard a 5 for 35 minutes a game but he's more than capable to guard almost every 4 and a large number of 5s "
&gt;LeBron James = LeJon Brames  Dwight's gym will make me turn into him
"The players have the leverage to do practically anything, yes. (They have the best contracts in American professional sports for a reason.) There's a way they could go about doing it without hurting themselves. Unfortunately, DeMar DeRozan is not the President of the union, so the push should be on Michele Roberts, Chris Paul, and LeBron James. If people make it a thing, they'll do it."
This has nothing to do with my post.  Kevin Durant played better than Lebron James in both the 2017 and 2018 finals. FACTS.
"Honestly my thoughts on his shooting are that Brett knows he can do work without a shot, and he wants Ben to figure everything else out before sending him to Hanlen. Brett wants to see how Kelle and Joel come back before sending Ben to truly rework his shot, and it wouldn't hurt to have an ambidextrous shot (see: LeBron James). I think Ben will get a  J. It wont be great, but he'll develop it with a trainer. I trust Brett Brown fully."
"Lebron James career PPG: 27.2  Kevin Durant career PPG: 27.1  Technically speaking, Lebron is scoring (ever so slightly) more than KD.  You seem to be arguing efficiency which is something else."
Lebron James is below average player outside the restricted area.  He is a 36% FG shooter outside of 3 feet.   He is below average from 3-point.  Below average from mid-range. Below average from the free throw line.
"Let's see. LeBron James would never lead a team to a championship, Kobe Bryant would never lead a team to a championship... without Shaq. Shaq would never lead a team to a championship. Phil Jackson can't win a championship without Jordan. "
"Kelly Oubre is currently far better than LeBron James could ever dream to be, and should be leading the Lakers "
I cant handle seeing that many steph curry's and lebron James in the same room
"Its hilarious that Westbrook is basically a smaller version of Lebron James with more heart.  And Colin LOVES Lebron.  The only difference?  Lebron is 6'8"" thus he can finish at the rim easier (Lebron's FG% outside of the restricted area is 36% for his career) and Lebron is on stacked teams with at least 3 ALL STARS for most of his prime.  Both Lebron/Westbrook dominate the ball and offense.  Both put up gaudy assists, points, and rebound stats.  Both are below average shooters.  Only difference is Lebron's stacked teams give him much more spacing and he's much taller/stronger than Westbrook so he can finish at rim at 73% FG. "
Lebron “Disney World” James 
I wonder why there isn’t a lebron James comparison ? 🤔
&gt; he also shoots two pointers within a percentage point of the efficiency in which LeBron James does  2P% is not a measure of efficiency.
Lebron James......Jr.
"Be honest, how many of our games did you really watch last year?  Probably not very many judging by your “assessment”.    Let’s start with Hart...3 &amp; D and a solid cutter.  He and KCP are going to feast off ball with James and Rondo out there.    Kuz.  Just as capable off ball as he is on ball.  I’m sure he’ll go 1v1 from time to time but James attracting doubles is going to open up all kinds of airspace for Kuzma, he’ll thrive.    Zo.  Everyone who doesn’t watch our games sees “point guard” listed as his position and assumes one thing when in fact his game is something else entirely.  Zo flourishes in the run and gun full court game as an outlet passer but in the half court he functions a lot more like a traditional 2 guard.  He really does need to work on his shot to make himself a more credible offensive threat and he needs to get better at finishing with contact in the lane because he thrives as a cutter.  He doesn’t and likely won’t handle the ball for us very much in the half court despite his “position”.    BI is the one we’re all curious about because he showed great improvement as a facilitator last season but also got much better as an off-ball shooter.  If he can be consistent in both of these areas he’ll thrive as he’ll be able to initiate and receive depending on the play call or situation.    What a lot of folks don’t realize is that three guys who used to dominate the ball last season are now gone, and those three guys were JC and Randle to start the year with IT taking up JC’s spot in the CLE trade.  Brook also used to get a ton of looks on the offensive end.  With those four guys gone it absolutely opens things up for our young core, and now we actually have a pair of veteran distributors to put the ball in the right place at the right time.  JC, Randle and IT tried, but they’d be a black hole on offense just as often as they’d make the correct pass, LeBron and Rondo are the opposite.    Regarding Beasley and Lance, they’re here to compete for bench minutes with our newly drafted youngsters who I’m sure are eager to prove themselves, and however you look at it, I’m much happier running with Lance and Beas off the bench than I am running a 32 year old rookie from the G-League no matter how awesome his story was.  "
"It's not similar at all.  LeBron James and Colin Kaepernick using their platform to talk about important social issues is a hell of a lot different than Devin Booker needlessly making fun of random people playing basketball. He's just being an asshole, not an advocate for positive change like Kaepernick or LeBron."
"You mean LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Paul George’s daddy?"
"Well, you say anything critical about Lonzo Ball or LeBron James and folks will react as if it's the most disrespectful thing ever. "
Lebron James is the least successful nba poster child ever.

TIL 25/5/5 as a 21 year-old is not worth a max. I guess you literally need to be Micheal Jordan or Lebron James to deserve a max rookie extension.
"Something that also isn't being mentioned is that the WNBA is not nearly as ""star"" oriented as the NBA is. IOW - LeBron James is going to bring in a lot more money to the Lakers and the league simply by playing on that team. The WNBA isn't built like that. Name me one or two players in that league that have that kind of power. They don't. People like the sport and will watch regardless of any one or two players. So you have much less bargaining power."
"Jokic is definitely better than Horford offensively, but I think the gap between the two on defense is wider than the gap between the two on offense. Jokic allowed 68% shooting at the rim, Horford was 2nd team all-defense and the lead defender on the best statistical defense in the league. In the playoffs he hit multiple game winning buckets while defending Giannis, Simmons, and (at times) LeBron James.  I put a lot of weight into playoff results. I hope the Nuggets make the playoffs so we can see what Jokic is like when teams are multiple days to scout and plan for him."
"The funny thing is that Jordan was extremely careful of his image throughout his career and widely admired before his Hall of Fame speech.  At that point it’s clear that he decided he did not care anymore and gave a speech that was deliberately obnoxious, in a setting where even Dennis Rodman acted humble and gracious.  I think Jordan envied people like Charles Barkley who could get arrested for soliciting a prostitute without hurting his reputation.  Jordan was tired of being careful all the time.  So he took a jackhammer to his own pedestal.  And it didn’t matter!  Jordan still earns more money from endorsements than any other NBA player, active or inactive. And that includes LeBron James."
"I mean they have Lebron James, not going all in now is a waste of one the greatest players of all time.  It's very possible they dont win anything but not trying to win something would be imo, very dumb.  Like Kareem said, “I can accept failure, but I can't accept not trying.” -  "

"I don't know man. The NFL claims to respect it's history but the organization/fanbase seems to not give a flying fuck about retired players being shells of themselves.   The NBA at least provides assistance for retired players. Here's some information from the recent CBA:  &gt;With Jordan, now the league's most famous owner, working over his fellow co-owners to lend a very influential assist along with current stars like Chris Paul, LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony voicing their desire to take care of the previous generations of NBA players, the NBA will become the first professional sports league to offer retired players medical benefits as part of a comprehensive and enhanced player retirement package.  Source:http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18332488/retired-nba-players-benefit-new-cba  So while legends get dismissed sometimes, at least the NBA cares.

I just dont understand what the harm is in signing LeBron James especially to a 4 year contract. If they get set back 5 years it's the fault of themselves not LeBron. He has no organizational power that they dont give him themselves. Why would you blame Lebron for organizational decisions?

"Lebron James shot 33.3% on wide open 3s in the playoffs. Combine that with the fact that he would have about 2 seconds to actually get the shot off immediately after catching it, as well as the fact that he is rather deep... Yeah he probably wasn't gonna make that shot. So let's chill with the whole ""JR cost them the game"". He secured the rebound over a 7 footer and forced OT against a team with 3 GOAT level shooters who are known for making game winners, Lebron only scored 2 points and shot 0-3 in OT..."
Can we talk about how weird it is that we’re living in a timeline where Lebron fucking James is the David in this situation?
"Giannis is one of 5 players to lead their team in every statistical category after Dave Cowens (1977-78), Scottie Pippen (1994-95), Kevin Garnett (2002-03) and LeBron James (2008-09)."
"your name is literally king james so clearly this is a very unbiaised opinion. anyways, of course its a difficult shot. he has a defender right in his face, and he was backing up before the shot putting him off balance, and the pressure of the shot also definitely played a factor, so don't pretend that was an easy shot. lebron dragged a terrible team to the finals through an eastern conference that is so laughably weak its not even funny. He would have lost in the finals to the Jazz, Warriors, Rockets, OKC and Pelicans. LeBron can't win without a super team and even then he is 3-6 in the finals. Don't even say that LeBron losing to the best team ever twice isn't a bad thing as if he didn't lose against the fucking Mavericks, scoring EIGHT POINTS in the final game, and an aging Spurs team as well. Saying MJ wouldn't be able to carry the Cavs to the finals is totally wrong as well but that argument is not something I want to get into. "
"Yeah, LeBron James got shook in 2018.  I initially thought it was his eye that stopped him from wanting to take outside shots, it could have been that also. I don't see the reason for him to lie. If he said he was basically playing with a broken hand, it must have at least been hurt enough to the point where it made things a little different. Even a minimal change to a jumpshot can fuck it up."
Fuck the rules I’m Lebron James
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
Giannis is better than lebron james
I was literally on a mission trip in Romania last month and everyone knew who Lebron was. I’m not saying they didn’t know Jordan but it never came up. The first conversation I had with a woman who could barely speak English was about things I like to do here in the US and when I said basketball she immediately said “Lebron James”. We were having the hardest time communicating and the one thing we had a mutual understanding of was Lebron. 
"You can't spell LeBron James without LA, ya know"
LeBron's dad is [Anthony McClelland](https://i0.wp.com/www.empireboobookitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Anthony-McClelland-LeBron-James-Dad.jpg?resize=250%2C292&amp;ssl=1).  He has a [half brother](http://yallknowwhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/img_7507.jpg) who is the acknowledged son of McClelland.  The Nate Thurmond thing mostly rests on the hairline and timing lining up.
As of today LeBron probably isn’t even the most popular athlete in the world with the name “James”
"He lost them the game by essentially wasting those last three seconds instead of finding a wide open LEBRON JAMES. It would have been an easy pass too. He didn't necessarily lose the game,  but he kind of demolished the fully legit chance they had to win it. This loss wasn't his fault necessarily,  but people absolutely obsess over decision making in the final seconds of the game so he's been roasted ever since.  He does do sorta dumb stuff like this all the time though so his team and their fans have a hair trigger for him. He's a massive pot head by all accounts. "
Chris Paul doesn't belong in that group anymore in 2018. He's an above average defender at this stage of his career not an All NBA defense one.   Beyond that in terms of others I haven't really seen mentioned.   Luc Mbah Moute is wildly underrated and the past 3-4 years has held Dame Lillard to 21% shooting in about 125 poss matched up vs him and LeBron to 31% shooting in about 170 poss. Really versatile.   Dejounte Murray was worthy of his All NBA defense selection he's already in this convo.   Ricky Rubio and Kyle Lowry are still very good evne if they might not be in the absolute very top tier.   Victor Oladipo might be my favorite guard to watch defensively for off ball defense.   Dante Exum has very real all nba defense potential did a good job in the playoffs vs James Harden in particular   I thought as a rookie Ben Simmons hada real case for an All NBA defense team which for a guy with his experience is wild   Wes Matthews is another underrated guy who is as versatile as anybody capable of guarding anybody from Dame Lillard to [Kristaps Porzingis](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2018/1/9/16864604/wesley-matthews-defense-stands-out-loss-mavericks-knicks-kristaps-porzingis). 
OP is rambling without a point or thesis. If you are genuinely curious just google Lebron James and read his wiki page of accomplishments on why people idolize him.  Now if you are saying he isnt worth the praise maybe make it clear and state why you think so. 
Someone post the LeBron James government experiment copypasta
"Let me get this out of the way, Curry would probably win this, but Lebron was a better shooter from 28+ feet than anyone in the NBA since 2000-01. , [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/)"
"&gt; if prime shaq couldn't handle sharing the spotlight with kobe how in the hell does he stick it out for 5 with lebron lol  Because LeBron wouldn't command the spotlight. He would let Shaq goof off and be ""the guy"" for the first 6ish or so years. LBJ coming out of high school was incredibly humble (yes, even with the SI cover) and is/was a great teammate.   Shaq would have loved being the ""older brother"" to the guy that has always wanted to *just be loved.* James as an only child effected him a lot different than Kobe as a ""my way or the highway"" only child."
"Young guy, very charismatic, flew under the radar the last couple of years, seems to bounce around from team to team every once in a while. But he does a lot of work in the offseason so I could see some improvement. LeBron James "
"Copying this from another user. Kobe is the second most popular player ever. Kobe is not a top 10 player. Durant and Kobe probably end up close on all time lists.   &gt; Yes, Kobe Bryant is arguably the most overrated basketball player in history. He is often ranked among the Top-Ten players of all time, which I think this is absurd. The following are the reasons I consider Kobe overrated: Kobe is NOT an All-Time Great Scorer. One of the most prevalent arguments as to why Kobe is a all-time great, is his supposedly legendary scoring ability, which is often compared to all-time great, Michael Jordan. However, lets take a closer look at this claim and show why it is flawed: Kobe has only 2 Scoring Titles. Kobe has only lead the league in points per game 2 times, in 19-year career. In comparison: Michael Jordan has done so 10 times. Wilt Chaimberlain has done so 7 times. Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson have done so 4 times. (KD has been in the NBA, less than half the time Kobe had, and has twice the number of scoring titles) Kobe has a Career Points-Per-Game Average of 25. Kobe averaged 25 PPG, over his career. This is a fantastic average, however, it does not rank among the greatest career averages. Kobe’s PPG average does NOT rank among the Top 10. LeBron’s career average is 27.2 PPG, while Kobe’s career average in the same span was 24.8. However, Kobe is generally considered a greater scorer. Allen Iverson, who is generally not considered among the greatest NBA players ever, had a career average of 26.7 PPG, also greater than that of Kobe. Kobe has had the Worst Chokes in the NBA Finals. Kobe is often ranked among the most clutch players in NBA history. This is not backed by substance, and this is evidenced in some of his NBA Finals performances over the years. 2004 NBA Finals: Game 3 vs Detroit Pistons In Game 3 of the 2004 NBA Finals, against the Detroit Pistons, with the series tied at 1–1, Kobe had arguably the worst choke of any superstar in Finals history, which led to a loss by 20 points. Kobe finished the game with just 11 Points on a terrible 30% shooting, with 3 Rebounds, 5 Assists and 4 Turnovers. 2008 NBA Finals: Game 6 vs Boston Celtics Facing elimination, with his team down 3–2 in the series, with a chance to force a Game 7 in Staples Center, Kobe, the reigning MVP of the league, choked again in one of the biggest games of his career, which led to the Lakers losing the Championship. Kobe finished the game with 22 Points on a dismal 32% shooting, with just 3 Rebounds and a pathetic 1 Assist with 4 Turnovers. 2010 NBA Finals: Game 7 vs Boston Celtics With a brilliant chance at redemption, against a Boston Celtics team that defeated his Lakers two years ago, Kobe had a chance to cement his legacy as a clutch performer on the biggest stage of all: Game 7 of the NBA Finals, at home. Yet, he choked again. Kobe finished the game with 23 Points, of which he scored 11 from the free-throw line, thanks to receiving a ridiculous 15 free-throw attempts (ahem Referees? ahem). He scored 12 Points from the field on a awful 25% shooting, with just 1 Assist and 4 Turnovers, but did have a stellar 15 Rebounds. But thanks to the Referees (The Lakers got 20 more free-throws than the Celtics), the Lakers happened to win this game and Kobe won his 5th Ring. Compare these chokes with LeBron’s Finals: Game 4 performance against the Mavericks, which sparked conversation about LeBron being a Choke-Artist. LeBron put up a measly 8 Points on 27% shooting, but had 9 Rebounds and 7 Assists, therefore having about similar production as Kobe’s in the fore-mentioned games. Kobe has only ONE Regular Season MVP (Which he didn’t really deserve). Kobe Bryant has only one regular season MVP , which is put 12 players who have more MVPs than him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has done so 6 times. Michael Jordan has done so 5 times. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson have done so 3 times. Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry have done so 2 times. Kobe Bryant did win the 2007–2008 season, but did not deserve it. Let us take a look at Kobe’s stats, compared to other players’ performances. Kobe Bryant: 28.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG, 46% FG, 36% 3P, with a record 57–25. Chris Paul: 21.1 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 11.6 APG, 2.7 SPG, 0.1 BPG, 49% FG, 37%3P, with a record 56–26. LeBron James: 30.0 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG, 48% FG, 32% 3P, with the record 45–37. Amar’e Stoudemire: 25.2 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.1 BPG, 59% FG, 16% 3P, with the record 55–27. Kobe is an Extremely Inefficient player. Kobe Bryant has an Career Field Goal Percentage of 44.7%. Kobe Bryant, despite being a versatile scorer, has thelowest field goal percentageamong the Top 15 All-Time Career Scorers. Kobe Bryant has scored a total 33,643 Points, off 26,200 Shots. In Comparison, Karl Malone has scored a total of 36,928 Points, off 26,210 Shots. Which means, Karl Malone has taken 10 more shots than Kobe Bryant, but has scored 3,285 more points. Kobe has the Most Career Field Goals Missed. Kobe has missed 14,481 Shots in his career, which happens to be 1,064 more than the next player, John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant hold the record with the Most Missed Shotsin a single game with 30 while shooting just 36% against the Boston Celtics in 2002. In the Top 100 for most field goals missed in a game, Kobe hold 25 of those spots, making for a quarter of the total. Kobe Bryant is NOT a clutch player. Kobe does have some great moments in the clutch, but individual moments do not mean he is a great clutch performer. Kobe Bryant missed the last 15 straight game-tying/go-ahead FG in final 5 seconds of 4th quarter/OT of his career, and his last game-winner was in March 2012. Kobe Bryant has a Field-Goal Percentage of 29.1%, over his career, on game-tying or go ahead shots in the last 24 seconds of a game, over his career, only making 48 out of 164 attempts Kobe Bryant has received multiple Undeserved All-Star Selections. Kobe Bryant has been selected to the All-Star Game in the years 2014 and 2016, for which he was undeserving. He received these on the basis of legacy, rather than on performance. His stats for these seasons were: In 2014, Kobe Bryant played a total of 6 games, where he averaged just 13.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG and 6.3 APG. In 2016, Kobe averaged 17.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 2.8 APG. Kobe has been gifted Multiple Championships by Referees. Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, whether knowingly or unknowingly, have been subject to some of the most blatantly rigged NBA Playoff games, in history. 2002 Western Conference Finals In Game 6, of a tight western conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, where the reigning champion Lakers were facing elimination, the Lakers received a ridiculous27 Free-Throws, in the fourth quarter, compared to the Kings’ 9. Watch the video below to see for yourself: 2010 NBA Finals In Game 7 of the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics, Kobe shot a disgusting 6 of 24 from the field. However, thanks to the 15 Free-Throwshanded to him by the referees, compared to the whole Boston Celtics team got 17 Free-Throws, Kobe won his 5th Ring. Watch the following video to see yourself: Now I am not saying Kobe is not a legend, I am simply saying that he is given much more credit than some of his more deserving contemporaries. He deserves to be compared to players like John Stocktonand Reggie Miller who are fantastic players, but NOT All-Time Greats like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Tough question because most basketball experts do not overrate him. Most place him somewhere in the top 10–15. That’s about right. But most young basketball fans do overrate him. Many put him in the top 5. Those that do usually do not have strong knowledge of basketball history; usually overrate individual play; and usually overrate athleticism. Players that are definitely ahead of Kobe: Jordan, Magic Johnson, Jabbar, Russell, Chamberlain, Lebron James In my view, none of these are worth debating versus Kobe. Players that are probably ahead of Kobe: Duncan, O’Neal, Bird, Olajuwon, Robertson Players that are close and/or may finish their careers as close: West, Durant, Curry, Moses Malone So, in my view, Kobe is 12th at highest. Or somewhere in the 10–14 range. That’s still great. So what I say next does not diminish him but only puts him in context versus the other great players. Kobe Bryant is definitely the most selfish and least likable teammate of anyone on the list. (Chamberlain is close on the selfish front. Robertson is close on the least likable front). When I engage in these discussions with my fellow GMs, we set up the ground rule as who would I want on my team for 5 years. This is an important distinction because character/personality become increasingly important over time. Indeed, Kobe would likely be in the top ten if this was a single game or single series. Shaq is another guy that loses ground in this area. At his peak, he was crazy dominant but his laziness and selfishness are draining after a period of time. As a contrast, Duncan and Magic are rated higher than their athleticism might indicate because they are the ultimate team guys. But Kobe’s character deflates his teammates, unlike the majority of those ahead of him who elevate their teammates. Over time, team chemistry decreases. And, of course, losses or implosion occur. Is Kobe overrated by young NBA fans, yes.  "

"Iggy won finals MVP for guarding Lebron James all finals and crushing his efficiency. Yeah he might not be a starter but he can start at times and was lockdown against Harden every time they played.

"247 didn't used to be good either. It was like a branch of Rivals. Just use rsci. It takes all the lists of the ""experts"" and averages it out. Using one site, especially when the ranking people move from site to site or leave for jobs, is just a way to use whatever list fits yours agenda. Dave Telep  is the GOAT, imo, and he was at Scout. Then he moved to ESPN (and now he works for the Spurs). But Scout a couple of years ago was bought out by 247 and they kept those lists instead of Scout's. Now I think 247 currently has the best rankings under Evan Daniels (actually Rob Harrington, a worker for scout, is the current best but Daniels is lead), but they used to be trash. And Rivals for as long as Bossi has been the lead has generally been fucking awful. ESPN now has probably taken over their lead as the true shithole of recruiting experts once Telep left, though... Just use rsci.  1998- Al Harrington  Donnell Harvey  Zach Randolph  Eddy Curry  2002- Amare Stoudemire  LeBron James  Dwight Howard  Josh McRoberts  Greg Oden  2007- OJ Mayo  Brandon Jennings  Derrick Favors  Harrison Barnes  Anthony Davis  2012- Shabazz Muhammad / Nerlens Noel (tied)  Andrew Wiggins  Jahlil Okafor  Ben Simmons  Josh Jackson  2017- Marvin Bagley"
"There's a ton of history in the NBA, so much that it would be impossible to describe it all in a reasonably sized reddit comment. Here are the teams in the East that will likely generate headlines (for one reason or another):  **The Boston Celtics**  -Second best odds to win the championship according to Vegas. They lost two of their three all-stars to injury last season but still made it to the Eastern Conference Finals. They have one of the best coaches in the business, Brad Stevens, and people are very high on two of their young players, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. Kyrie Irving (one of those players lost to injury last year) is going to be a major focus this season as the best player on a title contender for the first time in his career.  **Toronto Raptors**  After years of being the butt of jokes in the playoffs, the Raptors executed a major trade for Kawhi Leonard, a superstar who won Finals MVP in 2014. Their former coach, Casey, won Coach of the Year last season but was still canned after they got swept by LeBron James and the Cavaliers. The new coach, Nick Nurse, will have a lot of pressure to win now and sell Kawhi Leonard on the Raptors before Leonard hits unrestricted free agency (he can go anywhere he wants) next summer.  **Philadelphia 76ers**  The 6ers have two of the best young players in the game: Ben Simmons (elite at everything except shooting a basketball) and Joel Embiid (elite at everything, including trash talk, just needs to stay healthy). There's a lot of pressure on 2nd year player Markelle Fultz to step up, as he missed most of last season with a bizarre injury that seemingly altered his formerly great shooting mechanics. Another reason is that the 6ers traded up with the Celtics to draft Fultz. The Celtics used the pick they received from the 6ers to draft Jayson Tatum, who is already one of the more hyped young prospects in the game. Philly is widely expected to be a top 3 seed in the East if they stay healthy.  **Others**  -The Milwaukee Bucks arguably have the best player in the conference, Giannis Antetokoumpo, but have yet to win a playoff series with him. There's pressure on new HC Mike Budenholzer to take that step forward.  -The Indiana Pacers have a growing star in Victor Oladipo. The test is whether Oladipo can continue improving after a meteoric rise to stardom last season and whether the Pacers can get a top 4 seed in the East.  -The Washington Wizards have as much talent as all but the truly elite teams, but have struggled to put it together for several years. John Wall, their star PG, will feel the pressure of winning ASAP lest the team implode."

She has admitted several times in the past that she doesn't consider herself a basketball expert so she leaves those decisions to the people she has hired to run basketball operations. That would be Magic, Rob Pelinka, Ryan West, Luke Walton and all those guys. Unlike her brother, she actually realized she isn't cut out to evaluate players and do things like that. She's like her dad in that way; leave it up the experts. As the owner of the team she can hire and fire people but she doesn't meddle in the roster.  Jeanie has no input on the roster construction or anything of that matter. That's what I'm speaking of when I talk about ""basketball decisions."" She doesn't meet with free agents, she doesn't advise Magic or Pelinka on who to sign. She completely delegates all basketball decisions to people like Magic and Pelinka that work in basketball ops.  Jeanie hadn't even spoken to LeBron James until recently. She's largely not involved in basketball ops. "
"You did not throw out an opinion. You threw out something that is objectively incorrect. You make a claim about basketball yet you do not have the LOGIC to back it up. Let me repeat, there is no LOGIC in your conclusion, because if such a thing were true, then logically speaking, other things must also be true.  If Kobe Bryant is not a good shooter, there logically speaking, NBA defenses would leave Kobe Bryant open from the perimeter.  No, teams undoubtedly leave MANY particular players open. They say double Lilliarad or CP3 and force these guys to make shots. Al Farouq Aminu, Matt Barnes, Metta World Peace, Shawn Marion, Ben Simmons, LeBron James, Andre Roberson, are just SOME names of players that are left open on the perimeter and dared to shoot an open. Yes NBA teams do give room for players like Rivers and Gay to shoot jumpshots. Same with DeMar DeRozan, same with Dwayne Wade. But there is NO NBA defense that will ever tell their players to leave Kobe Bryant open under ANY circumstance. "
"You're insufferably retarded if you think Kobe is not a good 3-point shooter.  Lebron James has a career 34% 3 point percentage, and it has been a working defensive gameplan in the past to sag off of Lebron James and let him shoot jumpers.  If you play that same defense on Kobe he will burn you for 50 efficiently.  If you disagree with that you don't watch basketball, you don't play basketball, and you know nothing about basketball.  I'll let you ponder about why Kobe's 3 point percentage isn't very high, I wonder how long it will take you to figure out."

We all know LeBron James is the best player in the world. But is he better than Luol Deng?
Lebron James. It was the 2007 ECF game 5. After that game I was a die-hard LBJ fan.
"Lebron James, Monte Ellis, and Dwayne wade"
LeBron James. I watched the ECF game against the Magic where he hit the Game Winner and I fell in love with the sport (or maybe just watching Bron). I keep up every season and try to watch all televised-national games including LeBron.
"Perhaps some people will make fun of me but if i had to say someone it would probably be Howard during his Superman era ,he just looked so cool and dominant during that time and me being a short guy used to try to emulate him when playing near to the post or dunking .  Also ,Tony Parker and Lebron James."
"LeBron James. IDK why, maybe it’s because he was being pushed a lot in marketing but I always gravitated towards him and over the years I began to really love watching him play basketball. Glad to say I’ve seen one of the greatest ever play in person a few times."
Lebron James
"It just validates that LeBron James is really good. It should do nothing to change the perception of the disparity between the East and West in those 8 years. He had an unquestionably easier road. Making the finals in the West this year doesn't change that, whether the Warriors are injured or not, and it's reasonable to surmise he wouldn't have made the finals every year if he had always played in the West. "
Every year people do the same shit. Last year it was “the Cavs won’t make the finals “. When will people learn to stop underestimating Lebron James?
"Top Selling NBA Jerseys, April - June, 2018:  1. Stephen Curry   2. LeBron James  3. Kyrie Irving   4. Kevin Durant   5. Ben Simmons   6. James Harden   7. Jayson Tatum   8. Joel Embiid   9. Russell Westbrook   10. Klay Thompson   11. Giannis Antetokounmpo   12. Chris Paul   13. Draymond Green   14. DeMar DeRozan  15. Anthony Davis"
lmao lay off the koolaid what would you say if someone said lebron james raped me in highschool with no other evidence? would you belive them? i think not
"It doesn’t bother me.  It’s the league’s biggest name with the league’s biggest fan base.  Lakers games will be broadcast on the biggest networks all year so we’d better get used to it.  What DOES bother me is redditors referencing the abilities/potential of Denver even remotely impacting the coverage.  LeBron himself stated that the Lakers are [NOWHERE NEAR](https://www.ibtimes.com/lebron-james-says-lakers-nowhere-near-teams-denver-following-preseason-game-2721287) teams like the Nuggets after their preseason game.  And that’s not someone trying to water down hype, that’s a man who knows the game telling people to be realistic.  I look forward to more LeBron/Lakers coverage all season but it’d be nice if Lakers fans on here could get it through their heads that every Western team (most unchanged) that managed to secure a playoff spot last year is going to give them a huge uphill climb.  LeBron isn’t a savior he’s an opportunity for the Lakers to not suck for the sixth year in a row."
"Kyrie Irving on who has a higher IQ: Him or LA's LeBron James. “I don’t compare myself with anybody,” Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of a flat Earth. “I’ll let you interpret that however you want,” Irving said."
It’s the generation’s best player combined with the Leagues biggest fan base.  Pointing that out makes sense.  Mentioning where you think Denver will seed and where they’ll end up in the playoffs though doesn’t.  LeBron himself said his team is [nowhere near teams like Denver.](https://www.ibtimes.com/lebron-james-says-lakers-nowhere-near-teams-denver-following-preseason-game-2721287).  And that’s not him trying to dampen hype.  That’s a man who knows the game better than anyone being realistic.
“The Lebron James Lakers” 🤦🏽‍♂️
Fun fact: Lebron James is the cultural powerhouse of the league
"LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, PG, and Embiid"
&gt;Lakers' LeBron James  Still looks weird.
"Yeah, that Lebron James, he’s quite the up-and-comer, I think he could be a dark horse All-Star candidate this year, he made great strides in his game at the end of last year, Lakers should be extremely excited with his future potential"
"&gt; often holds the ball purely for the sake of getting an assist  I'd argue that you were implying play detrimental to the team here but fair enough, I do understand what you're saying.  &gt; Rondo is not a more skilled passer than LeBron James. The divide between their averages is approach.  I agree. I think he's *just* as skilled at passing as Lebron and CP3, and I think he's better at it than just about everyone else playing today.  If not for that first part I quoted (I agree he does that *sometimes* but it's hardly a significant factor), I'd mostly agree with you and put it more simply: he's as good or better at passing than those guys, but much worse at scoring, so he does his damage through passing."
"I did not say Rondo was a detriment to his team. I said if any of those players were to adopt Rondo's  playstyle it would be to the detriment to their teams because they have major scoring responsibilities.   &gt;When he passes up a shot for an assist, most of the time he's making the right play.   generally because Rondo is such an limited scorer. If he were a more reliable shooter, then it wouldn't be the right play to pass up an open three with the nearest defender five feet away.   Rondo is not a more skilled passer than LeBron James. The divide between their averages is approach."
"NUMBER 6:  Julius Erving, Lebron James, Bill Russell, Patrick Ewing, Derrick Fisher, with Tyson Chandler, and Porzingis from the bench. "
what are you saying about chicken nuggets? Lebron James is on the Lakers.
Welcome to playing in the same conference as Lebron James
Lebron has worn Jordans in games before - at least once  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Here [Lebron in Jordan 3](https://solecollector.com/news/2013/05/flashback-lebron-james-wears-white-cement-grey-air-jordan-31)
"Larry Bird, Lebron James"
Lebron James. 
"https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/1/16/14291110/lebron-james-highlight-warriors-vs-cavaliers-kyle-korver   it apparently wasn't the finals.   https://cavsnation.com/kyle-korver-reacts-lbj-pass/  here you can hear Korvers reaction.   &gt;“Oh my gosh. That was…I told him it was my bad missing that shot, that would have been on his lifetime highlight reel,” Korver told cavs.com. “That was an incredible pass, I thought the play was kinda broken, he was trying to pick it up and he whipped it around his back, right at my head and I was like wow I have the ball, and I’m open. I hesitated and I missed the shot, but thats what he creates, he’s got an incredible feel for the game and, you know, it’d good to be on the other side of the ball with him."
"I actually made a post where I SIMed a tourney with 8 teams made up of different jersey numbers. #32 actually won. I’d take a lot of these teams over the Warriors, tbh.  Here’s the thread: https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8uezs5/introducing_the_numbers_league_an_eightteam/   Here were the teams:  Squads:  **#21 Savages:**  Dave Bing/Charlie Ward  Jimmy Butler/Michael Cooper/World B Free  Dominique Wilkins/Wilson Chandler  Kevin Garnett/Thaddeus Young  Tim Duncan/Joel Embiid/Vlade Divac   **Rule #34:**  Giannis/Livingston  Ray Allen/Devin Harris  Paul Pierce/Tobias Harris  Hakeem/Charles Barkley/Terry Cummings  Shaq/Clyde Lovellette/Charles Oakley   **#13 Reasons Why you gonna lose:**  Steve Nash/Delonte West  James Harden/Doug Christie/Kendall Gill  Paul George/Glenn Robinson/Tyreke Evans  Joakim Noah/Marcus Morris  Wilt Chamberlain/Marcin Gortat    **#23 and Me beating that ass:**  Calvin Murphy/Lou Williams  Michael Jordan/Jeff Mullins/Jason Richardson/T.R.

"You are delusional if you think regular season translates to the same thing in the playoffs. We are talking about Lebron James here, don’t get too cocky out here jazz fan"
"Why can’t every player be as good as Lebron James? Why can’t math wiz-kids write a poem to save their life? People are just better at certain things. At this point in demars career, it seems apparent that he is just not as good on defense as he is on offense."
"Last night was not a real game, it was an exhibition game. And clearly the focus of said exhibition was on Lebron James making his Lakers debut"
"My point is that LeBron is clearly a worse shooter than James Harden is. Steve Kerr has the highest career three point percentage of all time, but no one argues that he’s a better three point shooter than Steph Curry. Degree of difficulty matters when looking at efficiency."
Damn completely forgot about him. For sure!  James Jones hardly played significant minutes. Not sure if he counts.   My point was more that the main Heat lineups didn't have this LeBron and 4 shooters thing going on like they did recently
"LeBron and Ingram hype needs to stop.  Hahaha, I think its really funny how all you dumb idiots (fans on reddit) have thought these two to be our best players instead of Lonzo who is and will be our Best Player and the best In the league. Just like losers who Like Harden or Like Durant or Like Shaq, Lonzo can beat them all with one shot in the direction of the basket or one rebound that he misses again. When Lonzo shoots it always hits the backboard at least. Bran-thin Ingram (He is So Thin) Can't Even Stand on his shoulders and LeBron James more like LeBr-uhh-I'd-rather-not-have-this-player-than-Lonzo. You'll all realize your mistake. You'll all realize your mistake."
I think adding LeBron James will result in more wins
"Perhaps a look at his career stats from mid range might actually give us a better of idea of how good or bad he has been rather than just one playoff series......         03/04 - 33.4%       04/05 - 36.0%      05/06 - 38.4%      06/07 - 35.1%      07/08 - 36.4%      08/09 - 36.8%      09/10 - 38.8%      10/11 - 44.6%      11/12 - 42.3%      12/13 - 43.2%      13/14 - 38.5%      14/15 - 37.0%      15/16 - 37.5%      16/17 - 36.2%      17/18 - 38.9%           Not exactly lead leading numbers there. Contrast that to someone like Klay who was at 49% last season, or Steph who was a ridiculous 60%. MJ shot 43.3% from midrange in his final season *as a 39/40yo.* He did that on over 1000 attempts. The only season LeBron bettered that percentage he had less than 400 attempts.       You can say a lot of good things about LeBron James as a basketball player, a crazy number of good things. Being a good mid range shooter is not one of them.     "
"Yeah, this sub hates Lebron James. Mhm"
Only Lakers fans are interested in LeBron James and Lance Stephenson. Got it.    lmfaooo im done
[Here you go](http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/LeBron+James+Jason+Terry+Miami+Heat+v+Dallas+nlcBcpjzc9ml.jpg) 
"No, I mean cross court passes like in the half court. Not full court passes. Love, Wade, and James all have that skill (Cp3 notably does not).  Lebron can be doubled teamed on one side of the court and throw the ball to a corner 3 point shooter on the opposite corner. No one else does that in fact I'm not sure anyone in nba history did that."
"Yes, there are extremely low volume scorers who thrive usually off offensive rebounds and lobs, but Towns isn't one of them. It's just not possible to create the kinds of shots these players are capable of finishing at a high enough volume to center your offense around them. If you limit by players averaging at least 15 PPG, here are the leaders in true shooting last season %:  |Player| |:-| |Stephen Curry| |Karl-Anthony Towns| |Kevin Durant| |LeBron James| |James Harden| |J.J. Redick| |Kevin Love| |Anthony Davis| |Kyrie Irving| |Julius Randle| |Chris Paul| |Nikola Jokic| |Kyle Lowry| |Giannis Antetokounmpo| |Klay Thompson|  So you have 7 guards, 5 center/forward or forward/centers and 3 forwards. That's pretty balanced and if anything favors perimeter players.  But yeah, if you take out the points filter, you add a bunch of both 3pt specialists and rim runners/offensive rebounders to the list."
"well it's the best player in the world's debut with his new team. We had highlights posted for Kawhi's 12 points. People are interested in seeing how stars look in new environments, especially if that star is the face of the league  I get complaining about a random Javale finish being posted, but this is LeBron James..."
"After one of the Pacers Cavs games literally every single post on the front page was Lebron related with the highested voted one rolling in at 9k+ saying something along the lines of ""Watching Lebron James play basketball is a privilege"" yeah but now its a problem lmao"
"JaVale had better total and per-minute production than LeBron James. His +/- was better, he scored more points, snagged more boards, got more blocks, and did it all faster. I guess that's to be expected from a guy who went 2-0 against LeBron in the Finals."
"LOL Lakers. This is it?! You get Lebron James, the best player in the world and you get blown out in your first preseason game.. I mean, come on. Lakers won't even make the playoffs"
So weird to kind of hear Lawrence Tanter calling out LeBron James.
"The closest thing to investigative journalism on the subject is that Shelburne article.  &gt;SO JUST WHO is Uncle Dennis, as he's known to folks in San Antonio? And what is his agenda for Leonard?  &gt;There are plenty of people willing to speak about Robertson and Frankel, but very few who will go on the record. Several current and former associates and colleagues describe Robertson as ""difficult"" and portray an ambitious family member trying to parlay his nephew's success into his own marketing company.  &gt;According to multiple agents at other firms who met with Robertson in the past few years, he was interested in starting a business similar to LeBron James' marketing company, LRMR, and enlisting their services because he was not a certified player agent. That didn't interest the agents who spoke to ESPN, because their firms had their own in-house marketing and business services.  We know that the agency that represents Kawhi (Impact) is shady af. They had both his uncle and mother on their payroll at one point. They have basically 0 other NBA clients. We also know that the uncle has asked agents about starting an agency with him.  We know this from documents presented in a court case between Brian Elfus, Kawhi's old agent, vs. Impact. Mitch Frankel is the owner of Impact and is now Kawhi's agent.  &gt;FRANKEL HAS BEEN known primarily as a football agent over his three decades as the co-founder of Impact Sports. But within the past decade, the agency decided to expand to represent basketball players, and Leonard was seen as the centerpiece of the venture.  &gt;That expansion did not go as planned, however. According to records obtained by ESPN, six UCC liens have been filed against Frankel in Florida since 2011. Former Impact Sports employees contacted by ESPN attributed those financial troubles to Impact's venture into basketball. Records indicate Frankel borrowed money from companies such as Cobalt Sports Capital and JS Sports Funding.  &gt;Former NFL linebacker Andra Davis, who was with Impact Sports for his entire 10-year career, said he was asked whether he wanted to invest in the company's expansion into basketball. He chose to do that as a loan, not as an investment, because it was safer.  &gt;""I don't know [Kawhi]. I don't know whatever that situation or his injury and all that. But what I can say is the reason I feel good about doing the loan is because of Kawhi. Put it that way,"" Davis said. ""I'm like, 'OK. You got Kawhi, one of the best players in the NBA, then I feel like they would've had a chance to get more top-notch guys.'""  &gt;Elfus' departure came around the same time several other football agents left the company. Ron Butler, Tony Fleming and Sean Kiernan all confirmed to ESPN that neither they nor their clients are associated with Impact Sports anymore. In fact, there doesn't appear to be an Impact Sports at all. The company website is under construction.   These are hard facts and cited sources. Not sure what else you really want. "

generational talent is definitely on par with Lebron James. It means that they have the skillset which could one day allow them to dominate the league
Man Rondo and LeBron James on the same team wtf
"really? then what the fuck does generational talent mean? to me and most other rational people that means larry bird, magic johnson, michael jordan, lebron james. ONCE IN A GENERATION type players. luka fucking doncic does not and will not ever live up to that label. point blank period.   and no, i don't think euroleague is a much higher level than college competition. it's extremely comparable. "
Kawhi played great defense. That doesn't mean he affected James's performance though. His ball denial didn't decrease Lebron's production no different than Lance's antics don't affect Lebron's production or Jimmy Butler's sliding feet don't affect Lebron's production.  &gt;LeBron was considerably more passive when Leonard was guarding him. He attacked more when guarded by another player.  Not sure how we can measure this. Kawhi was the primary defender on Lebron. And Lebron's performance was right at his normal production wise although his efficiency was sky high. When Kawhi wasn't guarding James it was because Popovich benched him for Diaw because Lebron was roasting Kawhi (This exactly happened in Game 1 of the 2014 Finals go back and look).
"He was [better than Curry](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/) at deep 3's last year, by a lot. I guess if you practice shooting from 30 feet, and defenders give you space at 30 feet, that becomes a good shot to take."
"Generational talent =/= LeBron fucking James. That’s a whole other level.  Euroleague is a much lower level of competition than the NBA, you’re right. That’s why nobody expects him to be an MVP contender this year. It’s also a much higher level of competition than college and he dominated it, or are we just not supposed to judge anybody’s play outside of the NBA? Maybe just pick names from a hat instead of drafting?"
I think OP is lost.  This is the LeBron James highlights sub.
"Lebron ""James Harden"" James with the LeWet stepback three."
"&gt; Bird, who as you said ruled the league, called him the best ever his rookie year.   Ok one mans words are the equivalent to the global phenomenon that was Lebron James.  That's not how it works.  More hyped....yet 3rd pick.  More hyped yet no internet.  More hyped yet the two of the most legendary players in the league were still at their full powers.  More hyped yet 3rd pick. This can't be stated enough.  More hyped yet Lebron's high school games were broadcast worldwide.  More hyped yet the Bulls tried to trade his draft rights.  More hyped yet Jordans first prseason game was lightly reported because the Cubs were in a pennant race against the Padres.  More hyped yet the attendance for his first home game was 13,000.  More hyped yet the NEXT FIVE home games failed to draw 10,000 fans.  His ninth game? 8000 attended.  Lebrons first PRESEASON game? Sold out.  Lebrons high school game against Oak Hill?  Nationally televised,in fact FIRST HIGH SCHOOL GAME EVER TELEVISED ON ESPN.   Featured on SportsCenter, staffed by Dick Vitale, Bill Walton, Dan Shulman and myself, FOLLOWED BY A HALF HOUR SHOW DEVOTED TO LEBRON JAMES, cross-promoted by a cover story on ESPN The Magazine on LeBron James.  Lebrons first regular season game? 2.8 Rating only one game of the prior season scored a number that high, and that was the first ever matchup between Shaq and Yao.  The Maloofs (Kings owners at the time) publicly thanked NBA commissioner David Stern for the ""gift"" of giving this game to Sacramento.  Lebron signed a NINETY MILLION Nike deal weeks before the game. Kobe signed a Nike deal a few days later. For 45 million.  More hyped?  GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.  "
Lebron James can definitely take this Lakers team to the Conference finals long as they don't get matched up with Warriors then it's GG.
"This rotation we've been seeing is why I've been saying the Lakers won't make the playoffs without a trade. They're going to constantly be deciding to either play Ivica Zubac or Kuzma at the 5. I don't care if you have LeBron James, you aren't winning 46+ games doing that shit.  That said, I do expect a trade to address this be/c it'll just be too obvious at some point."
Lebron James in full lather
i would like every play of lebron james posted on here pls 
LeBron James
Lebron James
LEBRON JAMES FOR 3

"I'm so flippin' happy.  When LeBron signed it blew my mind, and for a few minutes all I could think about was how much I hoped I'd live to see it, that I wouldn't get in a wreck or some other unfortunate incident.  And I made it!  We all made it!  We now get to witness what happens when LeBron Fucking James plays for the Los Angeles Lakers.  No matter how he does it's gonna be a hell of a spectacle, and I'm glad I get to witness it. RIP all the homies who can't."
LeBron James GOAT
"&gt; What do you mean im saying things exactly opposite of what you are saying. Look up the stats on Bball reference, the cavs played better in the 2nd half of the 2016. Every star played better once Blatt left and it is literally there on the advanced stats. Why do you constantly ignore evidence and put up your own opinions as facts?  I never said they performed better with Blatt, I have said the opposite multiple times. I just mentioned pace which you said was still low with Ty ignoring that Blatt still coached that season.  https://www.businessinsider.com/david-blatt-ignored-cavs-didnt-like-him-2016-1  &gt;Go read these articles and see how Kevin Love, Irving, and Lebron all called him out. Spo was never called out by any player  lol... Pat Riley literally came out and confirmed that LeBron wanted Spo fired. The big 3 and Riley had a meeting about it. Not only that there was a lot of question about him initially....  http://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/news/story?id=5862172  LeBron wasn't a champion when he came to Miami, him and Wade were much more of equals and both were the leaders of the team, Bosh was also to an extent. Kyrie and Love were not that, and the rest of the team followed LeBron as he was the clear cut leader. In Miami LeBron threw the same fits when things didn't go his way but the difference was that there was an authority figure there overseeing things. He would give in to LeBron at times and be stern at times. LeBron did not have that in Cleveland ever.   So when he didn't like Blatt in Cleveland, which was literally day 1 as reported by Windhorst, he became passive aggressive and the rest of the team followed suit. When you are looking for problems, you can find them. So yeah, I'm sure every player had their own personal issues with Blatt...but if LeBron doesn't set that example from the very first day people learn to get over it and move on.   LeBron had issues with Spo but was told to make it work and Riley backed Spo. Spo, with the backing of the front office, was then allowed to continue and gain authority. They still clashed at times but LeBron knew that he was not going to get his way on this so he moved on. He knew he could get his way in Cavs and so continued with the passive aggressiveness until he did get his way.   Like I also mentioned before, Kyrie didn't even like Lue, but LeBron did and no one was looking at Kyrie as the leader so he just had to deal or leave because LeBron comes first.   &gt;The Cavs were never going to choose Blatt over a disgruntled Lebron  That's literally what I've been trying to say.   &gt; he was unable to make improvements to a disfunctional locker room that ""He"" himself created through his poor coaching.  AGAIN, I never said Blatt was blameless or that he is some perfect coach. He clearly had failures...but this was his first time in the NBA and 1.5 seasons isn't really the longest adjusting period...especially if you are never given a chance to actually coach your way...which he wasn't.   [A lot of coaches praised and supported Blatt after the firing, reiterating how well respected he is by other coaches and how good of a coach he really is.](https://sports.yahoo.com/several-nba-head-coaches-sharply-criticized-david-blatt-s-firing-223909142.html?y20=1)..but yeah, these are just my opinons. Blatt is a highly decorated/winning coach outside of the NBA. He was never given a proper opportunity with the Cavs and that is mostly due to LeBron James.    "
"Y'know, I'm more a detractor than a fan of Lonzo's, but Jayson Tatum's mold of being a skilled two-way small forward isn't something we haven't seen before, i.e. LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Paul George; whereas Lonzo's skillset of being a non-scoring, defensive playmaking, rebounding PG is something for which I can think of few comparisons."
"I'm a Celtics fan, but I'm perfectly willing to argue that LeBron James is better at basketball than Gordon Hayward."
"No. Last year the nuggets won 46 games and missed playoffs. With the timberwolves imploding, they slot in. The lakers brought in LeBron James, so there will be another fight at the bottom and show another year of 43-46 win teams missing out. Dallas can’t realistically expect to jump over the .500 mark, let alone another 6-7 games. They only won 24 last year, so they’d have to nearly double that"
LeBron James and Kyrie Irving willing the Cavs back from down 3-1 in the Finals* 
"By that logic LeBron James is the greatest Laker of all time and it's not even a debate. ( Don't @ me kobe fans, i'm just pointing out how dumb his take is)"
"Ummmmm.....Damn, this Lebron James mean ALOT to some people.  Again, can't wait for shit like this to go away. Yikes. Ctfu. I'm a Nets fan, Lebron hasn't done NEARLY the amount of damage that Billy King did. No hurt feelings over here trust me. "
&gt;lebron james can move things with his thoughts    HFS
"There's no way the Lakers, who just lost Kobe and signed Luol Deng to a huge contract, could win an NBA Finals in the next years. They'd need a player like Michael Jordan or Lebron James."

So which part of the season was LeBron the MVP in, exactly? The first 3 rounds of the playoffs? "
"I don’t see James Harden is the same level as LeBron during the playoff. LeBron’s performance is indisputably better than any other players on the court. Well....y’all can always argue that it’s a REGULAR MVP. The true greatness always show up during the real time- payoffs, even the game 7. Not the regular season, period "

LeBron James.   
LeBron James on the All-Star team
He has a very good coaching resume outside of that brief stint in the NBA. He was brought in to coach a young maleable team but instead got LeBron James and his huge presence...as a first time HC without the backing of the organization that hired him...he was not allowed to coach and had no power.  That is not a fair assessment of his ability as a coach. 
"I have them neck and neck. CJ had a down year and they won 49 games and got the third seed. And I have a bunch of questions with the Lakers.  The Lakers would've won 40 games if healthy last year. They weren't awful. But Millsap, Butler, Kawhi (obviously), Gobert, Cousins, Roberson (and Carmelo on that team hurt them), Beverly, and Gallinari all missed significant amounts of time too and are all better/more impactful than BI and Ball. And the Lakers lost 5 players (Nance, IT, Randle, Clarkson, Lopez) who were all major contributors to that would-be 40 wins if everyone else was injured but the Lakers were perfectly healthy. 15 wins, to be specific, according to RPM win shares. Now, would it shock me if LeBron played 82 games, added 20 wins, and the Lakers won 45-50 games with internal improvement, and make the playoffs in the 5-8 seed? Absolutely not, it's LeBron James. But if LeBron gets injured and misses as little as 10 games, or if they get off to a rough start which always seems to happen with new teams learning how to fit around LeBron, they're gonna have a difficult time breaking the 45-50 win barrier that will be the 8th seed in the Western Conference. The 8th seed last year won 47 games while missing Jimmy Butler. Just as a side note, here are the start of the season records of teams that LeBron has joined/had to adjust to playing with him:  2010 Heat: 9-8  2014 Cavs: 19-20  2018 Cavs: 5-7; 30-22  And all of these teams had multiple players who were All-stars the previous years, and teams who were filled out to win. Paying players who helped win, even minimally, big money. Specifically this past year, he played with an all-star and 44% of his games against non-40-win teams. That will decrease to 35% of his games (by last year's win totals), and he's playing alongside JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson, Rajon Rondo, and a bunch of really young players. Will those players really adjust anywhere near the level that Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, Ray Allen, and more, did? Can we reasonably expect them to figure things out mid-season the way the other teams who fit around LeBron did? And none of that is accounting for the extra travel he'll be put through, the larger load he'll carry, the lack of shooting on the team, added talent to the bottom feeders in Dallas, Phoenix, and Memphis, and inflated win totals simply from being in the East. Not to mention that LeBron is going to be tasked with playing a style of playing that he's NEVER played before and is entirely different than what he's played his entire career. He's adapting to their system rather than the system molding around him  Has LeBron James proven me wrong before? Of course.  Will he do it again before he retires? Undoubtedly.  Would I be surprised if he somehow wills this team to the extremely high bar that is the Western Conference playoffs? Absolutely not.   But do I expect that to happen? No. "
"&gt;he lost the locker room completely  ...Because the head of the team literally turned to him and said ""no, I will not run your offense"", then proceeded to spam his own plays without even the slightest hint of the coach's offense.   You aren't exactly allowed to tell LeBron James to ""fuck off"" in that situation."
“I work for Lebron James Inc”
"Because James harden was just as good as lebron and was on a team that finished better.  You can debate what the true meaning of what MVP should be(I think we've been doing it wrong), but if you really can't see why James Harden won it, then IDK what to tell you"
"what people miss is arch height for the foot. you say relatively small feet, but really that only means small shoe size. does a size 14 flat footed person have a bigger foot than a size 12 person with a tall arch?  is a size 12 flat foot person more nimble and graceful then a size 14 with a tall arch?  for your science I think you should extend your studies of graceful and nimble feet into the shape and biomechanics of different feet. ignore size that is a secondary cause.  when you get further along, research barefoot training and shoes with wide toe boxes. I think training basketball players to play in zero heel drop shoes would increase their agility and balance off jump shots. a cushion heel influences bouncing to a dunk and land mechanics though. so any one baller switching to a zero drop shoe would have to retrain their muscles to accomodate the lack of cushioned assistance.  for instance, I wore lebron James shoes for a while and extra cushion and center of gravity over the heel affected my feel for the game. and you can see how lebron does step backs shooting of his heel, not his toes."
"**East:**  Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Andre Drummond, Kevin Love, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Bradley Beal, Kemba Walker  **Honorable Mentions:** Aaron Gordon, Jason Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Blake Griffin, Khris Middleton  **West:**  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Chris Paul, James Harden, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, Karl Anthony Towns  **Honorable Mention:** DeMar DeRozan, Jimmy Butler, Paul Millsap, Mike Conley, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert  The West is so hard to predict. It will come down to reserves who are on West teams that have good records."
Lebron James vs the Warriors vs the Cavs
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiCa4sKM7-w  LeBron James Scores Cavs LAST 25 POINTS In Game 5 of ECF | Full Highlights May 31, 2007 "
Yeah that won't happen. Prospects are always compared to current superstars. Every tall skinny dude is Kevin Durant. Every big fast guy that passes is the next Lebron James. Every white guy that can shoot 3s is Dirk. Every little dude that shoots 3s is the next Steph Curry. 
Why is this controversial? Lots of players are more technical skilled than LeBron.  What makes LeBron James great is the combination of extrem physical attributes with intelligence and skill.  This does not mean he is the most skilled player 
"How many people are even ""elite atheletes by NBA standards"". I'd argue guys like Steph Curry and James Harden aren't ""elite athletes"" if you compare then to guys like Westbrook and Lebron. "
Joining Lebron would put him in a position to help Lebron James win his final ring(s) and could signify Lebron passing the best player tourch to kd 
spankings in the content of defeating lebron James in basketball championship games and finals MVP awards 
"Those were the same playoffs where Iggy kept Lebron inefficient in the finals. That whole playoffs Lebron had back problems, but giving credit where it's due Iggy has consistently bothered Lebron and he is the only defender that actually does that and actually decreases Lebron's efficiency. Heck, we saw what happens when Iggy is not there in Game 1 of the finals this year.   Lebron has multiple buzzer beating game winners over Jimmy Butler including one in the 2015 playoffs. Andre Iguodala stripped Lebron on a game winning shot attempt in the 2015 Finals--[should have been a foul but is counted in history as a turnover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRF0OyqzAOg), and cleanly stripped him in 2017 Game 3.  It weird how people refuse to credit Iguodala for actually bothering Lebron and impacting him but want to give undue defensive credit to Kawhi. Iguodala is probably the best Lebron defender ever and he is the only defender whose defense affects James."
"Completely untrue and a dumb narrative. His minutes were down in that series averaging only 37 minutes per game. He sat out entire quarters later in the series and in the beginning of the series had the cramps that kept him out.   Further, he was his usual self with Kawhi Leonard guarding him.   &gt;Video tracking shows that James shot 12-of-18 (66.7 percent) with Leonard as his primary defender in the first three games of the 2014 NBA Finals.  http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91407/kawhi-leonard-wreaking-havoc-on-lebron  In fact, he was scorching hot the whole time."
"There was a guy that literally said Doncic is more technically skilled than LeBron fucking James, and I know that's not you but the guy wasn't only talking to you when he said to stop with the overreactions"
Lebron James
"What you're not getting is that the West is also *way* better now than it was in 2015. Back then the 8th, 9th and 10th seeds in the West won 45, 45 and 39 games. Last year the 8th, 9th and 10th seeds won 47, 46 and 42 games, and the 11th seed just added LeBron James. The Mavs are not making the playoffs this year, sorry. Not led by 19 year old Doncic and 20 year old DSJ. They'll probably be very good in the future, but this year they're a guaranteed lottery team again."
&gt;The Cavaliers were a mediocre-to-bad team until they drafted a kid from Akron named Lebron James  We really gonna sit here and do Mark Price and Larry Nance and Brad Dauraghty like this huh?

&gt; a certain LeBron James like player will live in the paint.  If only you guys had a player like that   /s 
"I would say he was a great franchise player UNTIL he turned down that fair contract. I can understand him turning it down, IF he performed. Lets be clear. LeBron James can score whenever he wants, usually. He did a number on Harrison, completely worked the kid so bad that Iguodala had to start. Iggy didn't stop LeBron, but he slowed him down enough and maybe kept him in check enough to hold the defensive system that the Warriors used. So here is HB wanting a max, that can't defend top players, and can't hit open shots, to lose a championship in 3 must win games. Yeah, I'm not a fan. Also, all these Maverick fans come out and defend him about how he's gotten better. He's on the same exact scoring pace and % since he signed in Dallas. Only difference is he gets more shots per game. "
"So famous athletes are straight up unknowns in countries where their sport is not the most popular sport is your overall point? What garbage logic. Depending on the entity making the estimation, basketball has between 850m and 1.5b fans worldwide. And that's simply fans of the sport. Millions and millions and millions, probably billions of people who aren't considered ""basketball fans"" know who the hell LeBron James is.

But players tend to play worse with Lebron James. 
"Let's see, the Lakers got *LeBron James* without any other established stars. Now that they have LeBron do you really think they are a less attractive destination?

LeBron James isnt a top 5 all time player let alone 2nd best which half this sub will have you believe.
Have you met our Lord and savior LeBron James?
"I didn't say he *was fouled* every time. I'm saying that if the refs called it every time he *was fouled*, they could tilt any game to the Warriors.  It would be completely bullshit if they didn't call every foul the other way too, and if they did call *everything* that was technically a foul, it would ruin the game.  But if they wanted to rig the game, they could do it while maintaining total plausible deniability that they were doing it.  Rockets fans were claiming that the refs were rigging games against them in which Curry had *zero free throws*.  There were some bad calls that series, in every game, both ways. They washed out roughly even.  The issue I have is the claim that this was somehow deliberately rigging the games against the Rockets, despite the fact that that could have been done better, easier, and the *total lack of motivation* for the NBA to do that.  It's not like their best angle for ratings was ""Warriors v Cavs, Round 4"". Rockets taking down the Warriors would've been huge. They could have hyped the fuck out of that.  And if you think the refs are throwing the game to the Warriors when Curry didn't shoot a single free throw, your homer bias is blinding you to the even-handed shittiness of the refs.  edit: the commentators commenting on it was annoying at the time, given the blatant fouls on the Warriors they were ignoring in the WCF *and* in the Finals. LeBron James fucking threw Jordan Bell to the ground and the commentators didn't say shit."

I haven't gone back and watched the series but I do think it's interesting that Curry didn't get a single FMVP vote in 2015.

Kevin Durant is better than Lebron James. 
"Many individual players sure, but in recent history I don't think there's been a single dominant team that didn't have at least one superstar/max player taking paycuts (or not being paid what they're actually worth due to other circumstances in the case of Steph and Klay)  Pippen - max player, wasn't on a max.  Tim Duncan - max player, wasn't on a max.  Kevin Durant - max player, wasn't on a max.  LeBron James - max player, wasn't on a max.  To a lesser extent:  Steph Curry - max player, wasn't on a max  Klay Thompson - max player, wasn't on a max.  This covers every single team that has won multiple rings since the 90s except the Lakers and the only reason I didn't list them is because I am not aware of their contract situation in 00-02 and 09-10. Wouldn't be surprised if Kobe and Pau were taking paycuts respectively."

Allow me to introduce you to a guy named Ben Simmons and LeBron James. 
"I’m just gonna copy paste this from a comment I made the other day. I think it applies to you just as well as the guy I was replying to.  &gt; You seem to be under the delusion that LeBron and KD’s moves were the same. I don’t believe you actually think that, it’s just something you use as an argument to support a player you like. On the off chance it’s something you actually believe, I’m going to highlight a couple key differences for you.  1. LeBron James joined a team with two other all stars that won 47 games the prior year. They lost 4-1 in the first round. KD joined a team that won 73 games and lost in the finals in 7 games. The main difference here is that while the Heat were title favorites every year LeBron was there, it is still very possible that they lost. There was always a team with the capability of beating them. In fact, they *did* lose 2 out of 4 years. Meanwhile, there is absolutely no chance the current version of the Warriors don’t 3 peat, and most likely they will 4 peat. Was it stupid to claim they’d win 8 titles? Yeah I agree it was pretty dumb. But I don’t seriously think LeBron believed that. It was just something to hype the fans up.  2. Look at the teams they left in order to make their superteams. LeBron was playing with the garbage Cavs. KD had a future MVP on his team.   3. And this is the main one so listen carefully. **Lebron James did not join the team that beat him**. If he found a way to somehow join the KG-Pierce-Allen Celtics you might have a point, but he didn’t. He lost to them and found a way to beat them, as opposed to joining them. Joining the team that beat you is the weakest thing you can do, in my personal opinion.  Are you capable of understanding the difference? If there are any points you need clarification on, feel free to let me know."

"It's as if some people have never suffered a moderate sports related injury, or understand the dynamics of recovery. A grade 1 MCL sprain requires rest. That's the main initial treatment plan required, and that's all. Of course, pro athletes have so many treatments at their disposal, but rest is key. Activity isn't recommended until after 3 or so weeks, and even then you're supposed to start doing only certain low-impact exercises. If it was the regular season, Curry would have sat out longer than three weeks.  After recovery, you have good days and bad days. There are so many instances of aggravation, extra stresses due to compensation, soreness and inflammation,, not to mention the fact that Steph was playing high level playoff basketball immediately upon his return, no real chance to sort of ease his body back into it. So, to say that because he shot the ball so well in his first game back, that his injury couldn't have possibly hindered him during the rest of the playoffs, is simple-minded and disingenuous.  I think Curry was definitely hampered by injury, but not enough so that it was the reason GSW lost. I bring up the Iguodala back strain as the costly injury for the Dubs in those Finals. The man won FMVP for his defense on James the year before, hurts his back in game 6 to the point where he has a hard time standing up straight for the final game and a half, and lo and behold LeBron goes off.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

LeBron James 
Still seems like an overreaction by Laker Legend LeBron James
http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11067098/lebron-james-greatest-weapon-brain
"I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? Lebron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA so.. So it's not the same thing at all. "
That would have broken r/nba worse than Kevin Durant joining GSW because the Wizards were the closest to handing Lebron his first round loss. (not because of team quality/skill but shenanigans)  Read up on the crab dribble here:  https://www.bulletsforever.com/2016/6/7/11873892/washington-wizards-cleveland-cavaliers-rivalry-lebron-james-kyrie-irving-john-wall  Lebron literally ushered in the era where superstar calls (already being labeled to MJ) went beyond rule breaks and of course nowadays everything is shifted towards James Harden and Kevin Durant (with occasional Lebron James flops) being done in the name of abusing and making the game what it is today.  The Decision was not the first time Lebron has semi-ruined the league.
"of course, I wasn't implying that there are also free throw rates that are irrational, like Lebron james shooting 1/sqrt(2) or dwight howard shooting 1/pi or something; I was distinguishing between ""exact same"" and same up to certain number of decimals, e.g. if Nash shot 0.90356 and Curry shot 0.90355 it wouldn't count as the same for our purposes."
"McGee to Young, back to McGee, up for the layup! Oh! Unblocked by James! LeBron James with the acceptance!"
The Lebron James to Lakers Media Circus  Just how much will Kawhi play next year/his long term status.  Will Denver finally make the playoffs?  &amp;#x200B;
"Ever consider that Kyrie has a much higher profile than JJ Reddick? Really annoying when people racialize an issue that isn't race based. It really distracts from the crux of the discussion and takes away from insightful input.  If JJ Reddick was a former first overall pick, former Lebron James wingman and one half of championship winning team, had an infamous Pepsi skit that got turned into a major motion picture, and had a popular pro shoe with a Nike, people would most definitely care a lot more what he has to say."
"I hope my take on the topic make sense.  In my opinion, LeBron James is the best NBA player of all time. His mix of scoring, rebounding, and passing is unmatched by any other. Although Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook also possess similar abilities, James’ physical dominance along with his knowledge of the game paces him far ahead of those two.  However, I believe Michael Jeffery Jordan is the greatest NBA player of all time. No one will debate his drive and will, along with his freakish athleticism against anyone else that ever played the game. His accomplishment is amazing; he led the league in scoring 10 times, 6-6 Finals record, Defensive Player of the Year, 9 times All Defensive 1st Team, and much more."
LeBron James is an above average basketball player.
"Somehow, the Lakers got LeBron James but the Celtics STILL have the most annoying fans on this sub. "
"You seem to be under the delusion that LeBron and KD’s moves were the same. I don’t believe you actually think that, it’s just something you use as an argument to support a player you like. On the off chance it’s something you actually believe, I’m going to highlight a couple key differences for you.  1. LeBron James joined a team with two other all stars that won 47 games the prior year. They lost 4-1 in the first round. KD joined a team that won 73 games and lost in the finals in 7 games. The main difference here is that while the Heat were title favorites every year LeBron was there, it is still very possible that they lost. There was always a team with the capability of beating them. In fact, they *did* lose 2 out of 4 years. Meanwhile, there is absolutely no chance the current version of the Warriors don’t 3 peat, and most likely they will 4 peat. Was it stupid to claim they’d win 8 titles? Yeah I agree it was pretty dumb. But I don’t seriously think LeBron believed that. It was just something to hype the fans up.  2. Look at the teams they left in order to make their superteams. LeBron was playing with the garbage Cavs. KD had a future MVP on his team.   3. And this is the main one so listen carefully. **Lebron James did not join the team that beat him**. If he found a way to somehow join the KG-Pierce-Allen Celtics you might have a point, but he didn’t. He lost to them and found a way to beat them, as opposed to joining them. Joining the team that beat you is the weakest thing you can do, in my personal opinion.  Are you capable of understanding the difference? If there are any points you need clarification on, feel free to let me know."
"If he helps Lonzo and moves on, nothing but ""thank you"". I never considered him as a long term solution. My point was that Rondo wasn't alone to blame in Dallas. Carlisle butted heads with Kidd too. He can be a pain in the ass but you can't deny that he's one of the smartest players to play the game. Plus, lately he seems to be helping young players wherever he goes and I think that will benefit them, considering how demanding James is.  Thanks for LeBron, I'm cautiously optimistic about that."
"Watch highlights on YouTube! I don't follow soccer but I know some of the main players (Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar, etc.) I assume you know some names like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Steph Curry. Watch some of their highlights, you'll pick it up fast.  The best way is to watch actual games live, once the season starts. The commentators will sometimes explain the referee's calls which will be helpful in understanding the rules of the game (3 seconds, 5 seconds, blocking vs charging fouls, traveling, etc)."
Don't watch the Hawks lmao they're gona be shit next year. This is a homer pick but I'd suggest the Lakers. They've got the best player in the world in Lebron James and a bunch of strange characters as well so it's gonna be a hot mess of a season. But if you're looking for an eastern team that's easier timewise then I'd suggest the Nets or the Pacers. They're young and fun teams that play fast.
I know he was the leading scorer on a team that took LeBron James to a game 7 in the ECF.

"Bruce Bowen was DPOY. Hell, Dwight Howard was multiple DPOY. Never thought that made those better than LeBron and Kareem. As for James choking, can we assume that Dirk could be the reason for that. I mean, given the ""arguments"" you present... everything is an argument."

"Defense is just as, if not more, important as/than offense.  Fans routinely undersell it, ignoring that good defense creates transition offense - the most efficient offense we have.  Even if it's not true transition offense, running back after being stopped on offense is harder - matchups are often scrambled, and you don't have that 1/2 second breather to switch gears.  They ignore that a good defensive team is usually the one that's better conditioned.  They ignore that defense ""travels"".  That defensive role players are more reliable than offensive ones.  In cases of big men, it's even more vital.   Just look at this year's playoffs -   The Cavs face only one truly good defensive team in the east, the Celts, and they're still asking Brown/Tatum to take that assignment.  The minute LeBron is facing Iguodala and KD it is 3x harder.  The Rockets almost beat the Warriors.  Not because their vaunted offense worked wonders - it in fact let them down quite a bit.  They almost won because they had incredible defenders doing serious work.  How did the Cavs beat the Warriors superteam taht one time?  Oh yeah, by having out-of-their-mind defensive performances from some of the role players like JR Smith allowing them to do things like miss baskets for like 5 minutes before Kyrie hits ""the shot"" and James makes ""the block"".  For big men it's especially important.  Someone like KAT may be an A+ offensive player but his inability to anchor any semblance of a defense was the undoing of a team that had a top 5 offense somehow.    Conversly Clint Capela is a limited offensive player (though his finishing and roll play has been really impressive) but his defensive versatility made him an absolutely vital part of the team that almost undid the warriors."

"According to the first one, LeBron James, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook were the 3 best players in the league last year. Pretty crazy.  I agree advanced stats can be finnicky and thrown off by some noise, though. Care to elaborate on what Wiggins does well that doesn't show up in the box score? (Why is this stat specifically unfair to Wiggins compared to other players?)  &gt;You advanced stats nerds are some fucking weirdos  I think it's weirder to claim Wiggins is a good basketball player with literally nothing to back it up.   Also, the stat doesn't mean Zaza is better than Wiggins. Cody Zeller shot better from 3 than Curry last year. Do you think that means he's a better shooter than Curry?  Wiggins is a more talented player than Zaza; that doesn't mean he helps his team more than Zaza helps his. "

"Yeah its the trap the entire league falls into.   There's just a lot of things in play at it. Part of it is how to a large extent players often still get viewed through the lens of ""Can they get buckets?"" by their teammates and coaching staff when evaluating them. It's why you see Chris Paul and James Harden trying to go hard for Melo this summer: again player eval just through the lens of ""he can get buckets"". Just like Thibs used to play Jamal Crawford too much LeBron apparently legit wanted the Cavs to get him last summer despite how bad their D already was.   Another other thing at play is often these kinds of players have certain reputations established and certain clout. It's just hard for coaches to bench them in terms of locker room dynamic in terms of many other things. It's just hard for these coaches to bench vets like Jamal Crawford who have such respect on the team.    All of this kinda just falls into the same trap the internet does evaluating players not looking at the best overall 5 man unit of players and the best overall collective group you can have based off how they complement each other.   I think in particular with OKC you have to have this concern because like I said they played Melo a lot more last yr than what was best for them. Donovan caved into this last yr in other words. And as for Schroder apparently Westbrook is the player he looks up to and is his favorite player. So he might not be a locker room cancer in OKC but I can easily see him trying to emulate Westbrook, get enabled by him etc in ways that aren't helpful for your overall team's on court product.   "

"Yes and no. Salary cap is derived by pure arithmetic from sharing out a set percentage of basketball-related income the NBA as a whole makes.  Since players generate 100% of basketball-related income, a lot of them are going to be on contracts that pay less than they generate for their team/the league. LeBron James and Steph Curry, for example, *cannot* be paid their ""worth"", currently.  But:  1) Some teams overpay players more than they are, in fact, worth, for a range of reasons, some of which aren't even that bad.  2) There are a number of good players, and paying a ""fair"" rate gets hard to fit in under the cap - but if you don't pay what they're worth, someone else will, or at least might.  3) The owners, collectively, don't want to increase the players' share of revenue because they want as much money as possible. This has ended up with a weird setup where it's going to cost some of them *more* money in luxury taxes than it would have cost to just raise the players' percentage and with it the salary cap. The NBA doesn't care, because tax money can be used for ""league purposes"", which is handy for them, so they're not going to try and tilt the scales on that part of CBA negotiations.  Basically: you could easily be right, and the cap is too low, but this is a result of the complex negotiations between the owners and the players' union, and *shrug emojis*"

U really comparing Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert to Lebron James
"Pat Riley (on phone): “Okay, we’ll give you Dragic, Bam, a 1st rounder, all of our Miami Vice gear, and this cardboard cutout of LeBron James for Butler... if he’s as motivated as you say, then I guess we’ll take the risk.”  Thibs: “Ehhh, I don’t know, maybe you oughta..... hello? Hello?” (hangs up) “Hey Jimbo, you got Vlade’s number?”"
Lebron James will not average 8 3pt attempts a game
"Okay let's literally go through the line-up:   Kyrie Irving- all time talent.  LeBron James- all time talent.   JR Smith- mediocre streaky 3 and D   Tristan Thompson- serviceable big   Kevin Love- borderline a ghost in the finals   Richard Jefferson- decent off the bench vet   Iman Shumpert- disappointing guard  Matthew Dellavedova- a backup backup point guard who plays solid defense, barely played  Mo Williams- old mediocre pg, barely played   Channing Frye- old mediocre pf, barely played   So basically we had LeBron and Kyrie and a bunch of mediocre aging talent. Facing the most successful regular season team in NBA history. But yeah no we were an all-time talent team with tons of depth and everyone definitely contributed. "
"Wade spin move dunking on Perkins is up there, and so is LeBron yamming on James Johnson in the 09 playoffs"
LeBron James has never averaged more than 5.1 3PA per game and this projection has him taking 8?  Wtf?
&gt; 3 Heat dancers  Not even Lebron James can get this deal done.
"Yeah the Heat are good. Nets are good. Lakers are one of the best. Knicks are great. Milwaukee are good. Jazz are good. Sixers are good. The Cavs are actually on my good list, as they are mostly pretty unbiased. Austin Carr sounds a little deranged at times ""LeBron James drivin to the rim and he throwwwws the hammmer doooooowwwnnnn deeeep in the Q!"" I find it funny though."
We replaced LeBron James with a rookie point guard. On paper this team looks worse so if we make the playoffs this season then this notion should be completely destroyed.
"I think Lebron and the Cavs wanted Kyrie to shoot that shot because they were going at Steph Curry all game and Kyrie was his matchup.  It's not like Kyrie has won important games with clutch free throws or Lebron has lost important games with missed clutch free throws so I don't see how that can be part of your argument.  What we have seen is Kyrie make a big shot in a game 7, but you know we've also seen Lebron do the same Game 7 vs the Spurs over Kawhi  with 29 seconds left. Kyrie's shot was actually with 54 seconds left and weren't the final points of the game either. So those two events at the very least cancel each other out. Then when you consider Lebron's library of other clutch shots, it's not even close between Kyrie and James just based on the facts imo."
"I definitely understand where you’re coming from, man. As weird as it’ll be seeing him in the purple and gold, I’m excited to see LeBron James a few more times each year. Best of luck to you guys on the long season ahead!"
Probably Lebron James since the NBA's definition of rookie is aligned with profiting of marketing players and not the cut and dry version of rookie that every other sport uses. 
"without reading any replies,  a. James Harden  b. Anthony Davis  c. LeBron James  d. Kevin Durant  e. Stephen Curry  f. Lillard?  g. Kyrie Irving  h. Russell Westbrook  i. Paul George or Kawhi. Most likely Kawhi.  j. Jimmy Butler  k. Drummond  l. Wall  &amp;#x200B;  Model seems to be a bit high on 3 point attempts."
"I'm actually stunned to read this stuff. Have people forgotten how unreal Wade was? Has enough time passed that fans never saw him? This man in his prime had a legit MVP case against Lebron James. He was the best player on the court for a decent portion of the 2011 Finals. He's easily a top 5 SG ever, and many have him 3rd.   Kawhi is fantastic, but he has a ways to go before he enters a conversation about taking him over prime Wade."

"You know why Michael Jeffrey Jordan is better Shannon? Because LeBron James, the FROZEN one, had to rely not only on Ray Allen hitting the greatest clutch shot I have ever seen in my life, but he had to rely on a number 1 draft pick BUSTING. If it were not for Anthony Bennet BUSTING, the Cavaliers would never have gotten Andrew Wiggins and traded him for Kevin Love, so that LeBron would have the perfect super team situation to run off to. And even then, he got his ring in Cleveland because he PUSHED for Draymond Green to be SUSPENDED, while having the Warriors CHOKE away a 3-1 lead! And what did it get him? A 3-6 finals record. What was Jordans finals record? 6-0, and without as much help as LeBron has. And now? He has GIVEN UP on basketball, and joined the Los Angeles Lakers. "

"I remember a few years ago in the playoffs when the thunder would get killed when westbrook went to the bench for a few minutes each half. The obvious question is why the thunder didnt just keep him in instead of giving him a 2 minute break each half. The thunder coaching staff said they had data that it wasnt worth it.  Then in the same playoffs James Hadden gets lambasted for disappearing in the 4th quarter during the series they lost.  I dont think harden choked or anything. He was just too tired to be the Rockets engine for 4 full quarters of playoff games (which makes getting CP3 so genious. CP3 can be the engine for a quarter and Harden the other 3).  Now, teams are limiting minutes for their players through the season. But I dont think thats the best way to prepare stars for the playoffs. If you train your star to play 33-36 minutes a game for 82 games for 6 months then you arent preparing for the 43-44 minutes a night where you get 2 days between games.  It seems like Pop has had his thumb on this for a while. He limits minutes but more than that he limits games. He would make players sit full games. And that would simulate the playiffs better.  For instance, if Inwas the lakers, I'd play lebron 31-35 planned minutes (no 4th quarters in blowouts obviously) and then after the all star break when the playoff seeding is better known,  I'd up his minutes to 44 but then sit him in back to backs and ither games that would be more than 7 in 14 days.  That way he would be ready to play 44 minutes every third day instead of 33 minutes every other day.  I hope that makes sense...so in that vein, a preseason game isnt a horrible time.to play all 48 minutes. The coach can see how his best palyers body responds to playing 48 minutes.  Now thibs knows how butler will react in the playoffs when he plays more minites and regular season overtime games when butler would get hifher minutes."

"He is LeBron James , the Clevelander. Born in 1592 in the Highlands of Akron and he is still alive. He is immortal. For four hundred years he's been a warrior, a lover, a wanderer, constantly facing other Immortals in combat to the death. The winner takes his enemy's conference and with it, his power.  I'm a /r/nba shitposter, part of the secret society of men and women who observe and record, but never interfere. We know the truth about Immortals. In the end there can be only one. May it be LeBron James, The Clevelander."
"If you're a superstar then you make the playoffs even with trash. Check what Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Giannis etc. were doing at that age. Kyrie is just another Devin Booker."
What’s that- lebron James
LeBron James did this like 3 times last postseason lol
LeBron James
Except LeBron James
"LeBron does not make 1st All-NBA team  Guards: Steph Curry or Kyrie Irving, James Harden Forwards: Kevin Durant, Giannis, Anthony Davis"
That’s with LeBron James and Kevin Love on his team.  Edit: And that’s with* meaning he’s exceeding expectations.  Edit 2: I’m saying it’s incredible given he had top talent on his team.
"I mean that's just dumb, in a 100 years by your theory no one will ever be able to have a serious top 10 because no one would of seen Michael Jordan or lebron James"
3 players in history to avg 20/5/5 as a rookie  1. Michael Jordan  2.LeBron James  3. Tyreke Evans
well done to them for drafting LeBron  james and Kyrie irving. 
"Lebron James Jr. doesn’t make it, however he wasn’t bad in college"
The Rock and Lebron James.   Name an other iconic Smackdown of The T dot.
"Kobe used to really guard Lebron well in one on one situations even into his older years. He would also score on Lebron's head a lot when he tried to guard him.   Lebron has never been the level of one v one player of a Kobe or Jordan. Hell, I think prime Melo was better as one on one player than Lebron.   The advantage Lebron has is his superior size and athleticism, especially in the open court. Plus his otherworldly court vision and passing instincts. These are the attributes that really make King James special. "
I will take one Lebron James please
[&gt;tfw Lakers fans admit Brad Stevens is more valuable than LeBron James](http://imgur.com/aZchP1M)
Filthy lies! Lebron says that &gt;!now that the main James family live in LA.!&lt;
"Those are three of the best players in the league, friend. The fact that those are the people you’re comparing him to says something. He’s far more athletic/agile than Steph Curry, but of course isn’t as great of a shooter. Steph’s court presence and handling are both outstanding as well. Kyrie’s passing ability, court presence, and playmaking are all far above average. James Harden is just insane when it comes to being able to finding a way to score, but there is a reason the rockets picked up CP3. Kyrie is one of the best in the league without a doubt. I’m not even going to say shit about Lebron because we know he does everything. "
Kyrie liked playing Lebron and said he wanted to stay in Cleveland and  'learn from the guy' right after the 2017 finals. Then the Paul George trade rumors happened and Kyrie got pissed at Gilbert. That had nothing to do with Lebron Kyrie and James are still friends and have been since Irving was a teen.
"Your second point was mentioned a ton when he initially asked for a trade, but everybody seems to forget it. Kyrie knew the team was built for LeBron, who kept signing one-year contract after one-year contract. If you’re a top player with the chance to choose a situation, why would you stay in a ship bound to sink once James decided he wanted to leave? The questions got annoying, all anybody talked about was LeBron’s status - so Kyrie decided to get going before it all crashed.   I think you’re spot-on about everything, basically. "
"""Nah"" - - LeBron James immediately after considering that. "
"At one point, for like a second, LeBron James considered signing with the Magic last summer.  But not the Grizzlies. LeBron will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies."
"These are just my opinion. I’d like to hear yours.  Shaq was best in 2000 for sure, dude was a shark in his prime, literally unguardable.  He’d even have a greater career if he had tried harder.   But, the tittle of best player of 01, 02, 03 was shared by Duncan and Shaq.   04, 05 best player was Duncan and KG; 06 was Duncan and Kobe; 07 to 09 was Kobe and Lebron, and maybe Wade in best season (08-09)  Wade was definitely the best player for a while in 06 final and one of the best in his prime (08-10) only behind James and Bryant.   Best player from 2010 to present is undoubtedly Lebron. He’s the king among kings, and only MJ is above him.  "
"Here's the thang Skiup, for this precise reason LeBron James decided to undergo hair transplants to avoid distracting their teammates, and elevate their level of play, further solidifying his status as the goat. "
&gt;Game-tying/go-ahead field goals with under 10 seconds left in the postseason:  &gt;Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%)  &gt;LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)  Where are you getting this lmao? He's made more shots with under 10 seconds left than with under 24 seconds left? That makes no sense.
"The problem was actually that people *did* want to play with LeBron, that's why they wouldn't sign. People only wanted to come if they knew they would be playing with James, but because he wouldn't commit, there was always the chance that they would end up *not* playing with him. Therefore, they didn't sign.   This wasn't a huge issue during his return, but it absolutely is what hamstrung the team the first time around."
He's LeBron James you've got to be lying to yourself if the casual NBA fans don't expect anything less than a finals appearance.
Lebron James. He is a force of nature but his stamina is gone.
"Barely legitimate. Cleveland loved Kyrie Irving. He was put in a tough place, having to ""compete"" for adoration against Lebron James in Cleveland. *Nobody* is gonna win that battle. Across all sports. Hell even outside of sports. Much less a teammate.   If all you're saying is that Kyrie wanted to be number 1, that's fair. And it wasn't gonna happen in Cleveland. But don't think he was underappreciated.   Funny part is that if Tatum continues his upward trajectory then Ky might run into that problem again. Not saying Tatum is the better talent or will be any time soon. But he's the homegrown talent."
"I thought the same thing. What about Mr LeBron ""I sleep 10 hrs a day"" James?"
LeBron James  Zero pressure   Pick one
"Who is shutting down anything? World = large scale. Community usually means = your immediate community. Plus did I not say he can affect his community but not the world? Are we changing the definition of words just make someone who is already more significant than the average joe feel better? Holy moly. I am not knocking what he wants to do just making it seem more realistic. And if you want to see why I said community, let's look at Lebron James: he created a school in his hometown and that's primarily affecting his community. How does that impact the world (if you use the actual definition)? He is improving the lives of those children and if things go will it can propel change elsewhere...like holy moly.   Jerk off each other more. "
The Ringer article from a while back did a good job laying out why it would most likely be Klay  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: [not as great as I remember](https://www.theringer.com/2017/3/1/16040876/which-nba-player-could-top-wilt-chamberlain-100-point-game-lebron-james-klay-thompson-91d0a821be2d) but the logic is still solid. No one gets hotter than Klay
Watching shannon Sharpe talk about Lebron james in front of Skip Bayless is its own section  of YouTube and I'm here for it lmao!
"They signed guys lebron wanted them to sign. And you're completely ignoring the Cavs shopping Kyrie? You can see why Kyrie wanted to leave that incompetent franchise that really lives and dies by one player: lebron James. Without lebron the Cavs, even with luck that is completely unheard of in sports, is losing franchise. I mean, what other sports franchise can draft a top 3 player of all time, lose him after 7 years, get rewarses with 3 #1 picks in 4 years, get the top 3 player back, and still only win 1 championship. That is the epitome of incompetence."
"No, I just was talking about Lebron James, the leader of the team and how he walks. Not the others who followed his example and also played shitty defense. Just because I call out Lebron, my favorite player of all time, doesnt excuse the others, obviously. I know what I watched over a decade bud. "
Because blog boys/nba hipsters think he is the next Lebron James and the nba trolls think he is a future 7/11 employee when the truth is probably him just being a good player
"That's the problem. Steph, KD, LeBron are all worth their contracts. But there's no one who thinks a guy like Griffin, Millsap, or Hayward are as valuable as James Harden. But that's how they're being paid right now.  All-star (even fringe) salaries are ridiculously overblown."
https://brobible.com/girls/article/josett-latrice-booty-lebron-james/amp/
"There's a reason for that. Its because he's smashed them again and again.    You think the same about the Hawks, Pacers, Celtics, Wizards? Lebron has smashed them again and again for almost a decade cause he's fucking Lebron James not because the players respect him."
&gt;LeBron James of Los Angeles Lakers  Oh *that* LeBron James
"PG: Lebron James  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Larry Bird  PF: Tim Duncan  C: Anthony Davis  I went for passing, shooting and defence. Lebron would absolute destroy any PG in the league on both ends, thanks to his size and athleticism. Klay is an All-Star level 3 and D player (3&amp;D doesn’t do him justice), Larry Bird is one of the greatest shooters and playmakers/passers of all time and also a good defender. Tim Duncan is the greatest PF of all time, is a good passer, can space the floor a little, great defender. AD, although not a great 3 point shooter is good enough that he and TD won’t clog the paint and get in each other’s way. A DPOTY candidate and also a good passer. "
"Since we’re diving so deep into advanced stats as well, Brandon Ingram put up a season with 52.3% True Shooting which I’d say is mediocre in terms of the league average. Even then, the league average is above average for true shooting percentages (50 being just below okay, 55 being good, 56-59 being great, 60+ being elite)    Ben Simmons also has a higher AST/TO Ratio than LeBron James despite him being among the league leaders in turnovers like you stated. And yes before you say it I am aware LeBron had a higher usage rate last season than Simmons but that comes naturally when you’re carrying an uninspired Cavaliers team.      You’re comparing Ingram in his 3rd Year in the league to Ben Simmons in his first, in this situation I believe experience plays more of a role than age does.  "
Imagine having LeBron James clap at you for something you did.   I should go to bed

ehh we really can't beat lebron. i accept that.   so the only thing i can hope/wish for right now is for him to never win a ring again. fuck lebron james.   thanks KD!
I'm becoming Lebron James then
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler and Paul George.  Every single small forward in the league is connected to the Lakers.  "
"Harden had a much better team, you swap players and the Rockets are the 2018 NBA champions, the fact they were up 3-2, was mainly because of CP3. When it mattered, the MVP was terrible and they lost because of it. His regular season was impressive, sure, but Lebron was literally right on his heel with a better narrative. Basically two brand new teams, you lost your the ""the man,"" in Kyrie and your second best player was dealing with injuries all year. James Harden got the best point guard and floor leader besides Lebron in the league and still couldn't get it done."
"This game doesn't get talked about enough. It's the difference between this Warriors dynasty winning 3 chips in 4 years with the presumption of a 4th already laid on them and being 50% in Finals series with serious doubts about the title favorite this year.  It changes Chris Paul and James Harden's legacy from possibly the two greatest players never to win a title to contention for greatest championship backcourt in league history (I'm assuming they also defeat the Cavs, maybe a big assumption given Houston's injuries/fatigue this series... But man, this gets even crazier if Houston wins and LeBron manages to beat them in the finals...).  Suddenly, the Rockets are the new powerhouse, the Warriors become, not arguably the greatest dynasty in the modern NBA, but one of the biggest disappointments... Wildly successful, but regularly getting beat on the biggest stage.  Are we asking ourselves if Kevin Durant was bad for the Warriors if 3 or 4 of those shots fall? If it's time to trade Klay for another playmaker? Who knows?!  And it all came down to a ridiculously flukey Game 7 where one of the greatest shooting teams of all time couldn't crack 16% from downtown.  This is arguably one of the 10 or 15 most important games in NBA history given how much it could have changed the league's narrative, how close it was, and how weird the deciding factor was."
"James was 30/8/4 and Lebron was 27/9/8, and for much of the season, Lebron was 29 points a game, that ""bad"" month he had dropped him to 27. He had eight new players on his team, halfway they do that big trade and get 4 new players AGAIN, and they were 4th seed. Yet somehow Harden is more deserving, okay."
"Lebron with the team he had was more deserving of the MVP, on almost the same stats as Harden. He had 8 new players starting the year, then halfway through got four more new players, drug them to 50 wins and the final; but yeah sure James was more valuable to the Rockets than Lebron was to the Cavs. If they lose Harden they still win, and Chris Paul is still there. If the Cavs lost Bron, they are weren't going anywhere, especially with K Love dealing with the injuries he did last season.  "

"Lebron just got there. Lonzo has a bad knee injury that he is working through.  Last seen on the court, Lonzo Ball played like he would be a *great* fit with Lebron James.  Rondo is smart. High IQ player to the max. Lebron is also smart. They will play very well together.   News flash:  Lonzo Ball is also smart. He is at this point, when healthy, four times the athlete that Rondo is. He will be the better fit with Lebron for the next few seasons.  You are ignoring the future while focused on the present. Yes, Rondo and Lebron should have good chemistry. Rondo will be amplifying Lebron. Lonzo could become a top 10 player. The ceiling is much higher. They aren’t going to give up on him this quickly before even seeing what they are like on court.  And when that time comes, they are going to be really good."

All I know is 3rd and 4th year Derrick Rose wasn't getting bested by any top point guard in a game when they matched up, his wall at that time was the 2nd best player ever Lebron James. Which for a 22 year old is the best you can ask of them...  I hold belief that with a injury free progression, Rose is in that 2nd tier of the league with Durant, Curry and Harden after LBJ.

He led his team to the Eastern Conference Finals in his third season (imagine Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, or Jamal Murray putting up postseason stats in their third seasons like below- all entering their 3rd seasons)  Eastern Conf Finals against the 64 win Pistons coming off 2 consecutive finals appearances and a championship:  27 PPG, 6 RPG, 5 APG, 62% FG, 81% FT  NBA FINALS 2006  After 2 sub par performances on the road in Dallas in Games 1 and 2, and obviously falling into a 2-0 series deficit, Wade went onto to lead the Heat to 4 straight victories and the Miami Heat's first championship in Franchise History, on the back of these numbers, here are the key games:  Game 3: 42 PTS, 13 REB Game 4: 36 PTS Game 5: 36 PTS, 10 REB, 5 ASTS, 4 STL, 3 BLK  AVG: 35PPG, 8RPG, 4APG, 3SPG, 1BPG  John Hollinger wrote in 2012, that this series performance by Wade, may have been better any of Jordan's 6, ahead of Magic, Bird, Kobe, or Duncan, Russell.  ""Whilst it seems strange to having anyone besides Michael Jordan in the top spot for the greatest finals performance of all time, the truth is, Jordan never dominated a finals series to this extent. Many called Wade's 2006 finals ""jordanesque"". They may have been selling Dwyane Wade short"".  Definitely a debatable quote by Hollinger, but you get the message about how great it was.  WHAT HAPPENED AFTER?  For those who aren't aware, Dwyane made a decision that he would later regret for the rest of his career - choosing to remove his meniscus in his knee in college after listening to poor medical advice.  The meniscus plays a crucial role - without it the long term risks to knee damage are severely high, including loss of cartilage amongst other ailments. For more info on Wade's injury history, here's a link:  http://heathoops.com/2013/11/through-severe-knee-injuries-dwyane-wade-continues-to-endure/  After winning the championship in 2006, D-Wade battled the knee that was beginning to show bad signs and his body began to give up on him, leading critics on the path of wandering if Wade was going to be the next T-Mac - possibly the greatest who never made it there. He missed super large chunks of the ensuing 2006-07 season, as was shut down for the majority of the 2007-08 season, where the Heat finished with a mere 15-67 record, leading to the selection of Michael Beasley with the 2nd overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft.  The critics at the time were out there loud and clear after multiple knee and shoulder surgeries: ""Will Dwyane Wade ever be the same he once was?"" - with the latter agreeing to ""No."" LeBron James enjoyed a remarkable ascension during these missed years that Wade was out.  Wade worked out with Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant's trainer during the 2007-08 season and 2008 offseason, Tim Grover, who believed Wade wouldn't just come back to the league, he'd be back at a higher level.  Well that statement turned out to be an understatement. Wade went onto lead the 2008 USA Olympics Team in scoring (off the bench), and played a pivotal role in delivering the Gold medal after Team USA's loss to Argentina only a couple of years prior (the Redeem Team).  And that was just the beginning of Wade's monster return.  In 2008-09, Wade led a supporting cast of rookie Michael Beasley, Mario Chalmers, Udonis Haslem, Daquon Cook etc to 43-39 and a playoff spot.  He joined 2 other players in NBA history to rack up 2,300 points, 350 rebounds, and 500 assists in a single season.  Those players are Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  And he didn't even win the regular season MVP this season, It took an all time campaign from LeBron to trump him. Lets look at their 2008-09 stats side by side:  D-Wade 30.2 PPG (1st) 7.5 APG (9th) 5.0 RPG 2.19 SPG (2nd)  LeBron 28.4 PPG (2nd) 7.3 APG (10th) 7.6 RPG 1.7 SPG (7th)  LeBron that year, had the 12th most win shares of all time (the most since Jordan in 96'), led the Cavs to the best record in the league, it took that campaign to trump Wade's amazing all-time season.  WRAP-UP:  During the LeBron Heat years, you could clearly see with every season that went by, Wade's knees were just not up to the task of the gruelling grind of the long postseason runs.  In 2011 against Dallas, had the Heat won that series and LeBron not have had a shocking series, he would have been named finals MVP.  From 2012, Dwyane had decided it was best to take a clear backseat to LeBron, in order to preserve his longevity in the league, due to the health problems mentioned above. Imagine the luxury of having quite possibly the best second option in league history - because we all know when D wade was 80%+ healthy, he'd go tick for tack with LeBron when they went up against each other, and you couldn't really see a major gap between their playing abilities.  In 2012 Against OKC, he played a massive back up role to LeBron averaging 20+ PPG alongside him.  In 2013, you could begin to see LeBron taking even more of a larger role due to wade's health decline. Wade averaged less than 20PPG that series, however had a key game 4 that was essential to avoid a 3-1 series deficit. From there it was the LeBron show.  LeBron left straight after the near sweep to the Spurs in 2014, as this was the peak season of Wade's ability decline. He could see his health has set him back where could no longer be that old D-Wade, so the timing was perfect to return home and make good on his life long promise of delivering that city a championship.  It's amazing how Wade is considered a top 3 SG despite all this adversity he had to go through with health issues that it leaves us to think - IMAGINE had wade enjoyed the health fortune of LeBron throughout his entire career. There was a reason he was growing comparisons to the young Michael Jordan during his prime years, and it wasn't a laughable comparison.  He slashed like him, shared his explosion to the rim, his relentless at playing at full intensity and throwing his body around, and delivering in crunch time moments.  He offered all of us moments that I will pass onto my kids one day, an all timer, a first ballot, and a player you could always count on, over and again.  Just as you thought he was finished over the last 3 years, he started to tease us with vintage Wade flashes and moments, like the clutch performance that stunned Charlotte against the purple shirt man. Or the return to Miami after 2 long years away, and hitting the dagger in Ben Simmons face to remind him he was a rookie."
"In other words, is the gap between Steph Curry and Ray Allen's shot bigger than Michael Jordan and LeBron James' ability to play basketball? IMO, yes."
"Lopez's 3-point shooting will be missed, as will Julius Randle. Javale will be a much better PnR option than he was and can rebound, which Lopez didnt.  We lost IT, who was mostly terrible for us. Replaced by Rondo who can do wonders with our second unit (and help mentor Lonzo)  We also added LeBron James... who will clearly elevate the games of BI, Lonzo, Hart, and Kuzma all of who are presumably improved from last year as well "

"I know this is a bad example, but people don't remember how bad of a shooter was Lebron James in his first few seasons also. Yes, he never reached the struggles of Ben Simmons jumper, but you never felt confident in his shot. But anytime Lebron shot a jumper it always was ""That's some great defense on Lebron"" because you would take Lebron shooting jumpers any time of the week, but he worked on his shot and after like 3-4 years his jump shot became reliable enough to expand his game.  Again, Simmons will never reach that kinda offensive dominance, but the main point here is that you don't need to have a jump shot right away if you can impact the game on a high level in other areas. There are plenty of players who developed their jump shot little by little every year like Jason Kidd, Lebron James, Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Amare."

No everyone goes crazy for LeBron and the stars. Oladipo and the Pacers barely got any buzz around here until they faced up with James
"Agreed. I wouldn't say any of these players are really ""snakes"". I think there is something to be said about Durant being given the title of ""snake"". Even for Cousins, yea it's pretty shitty to leave to get an easy championship. But Durant and Westbrook almost beat that Warriors team. What Durant did is on a whole other level to any other decision any player has made in free agency, ever.   People like to compare it to a situation where Lebron James signs with the Celtics instead of the Heat. I don't really like this because the Cavaliers were terrible then and he didn't stand much of a chance by staying with us.   Instead, Imagine if someone like Julius Erving (76ers) chose to join the Celtics at the height of their Eastern Conference rivalry in the late 70s to early 80s. That's the shit that Durant pulled.  So in my opinion, he's the only one who anyone could legitimately call a ""snake"". I was fully prepared for the West to be incredibly interesting come playoffs but to be honest he kind of ruined that."

This is probably the sport where that matters the least, and I'm not dismissing those concepts entirely because there have been clear examples of talented on paper teams combusting. You are adding someone who can go head-to-head with Lebron James sometimes and singlehandedly drop 40 and also play solid defense. While our depth would be worse, we still have decent options at alot of positions and the starting five drastically improves."
Bruh are u kidding me. How is joining a 34-35 year old aging Lebron James worse than joining a 73-9 team that has won a championship before with 3 all stars. I wouldn't even see it as a weak move at best it would be a lateral transfer.

"But stephon marbury is a former player so he must know more about the game than everyone who's never played in the NBA. That was the crux of your argument. Therefore, you believe that Zion Williamson is better than LeBron James."
It's quite reasonable since Doncic hasn't played yet but it's very likely Doncic will have a better rookie season than Zo's. I also don't think Zo will have significant improvement in his numbers because of the Rondo acquisition and he also has to share playmaking duties with a man named LeBron James.
Or perhaps you should recognize that Michael Jordan is superior to Lebron James and stop citing these bs statistics to prove LBJ is better than MJ.
"What are you looking for? If you google what NBA-banned substance is LeBron James using to get jacked then you’re not going to find shit. The guy is the picture of health and has been for years.

"I always viewed James Johnson as a ""discount"" Lebron.  Similar build, way less talent and BBIQ.  He fought MMA at 6'9 245, and went undefeated (7-0 MMA, 20-0 kickboxing).  I feel like Lebron would be similar in the ring if he trained the way JJ has his whole life.  Except if both of them didn't play basketball, they might even pack on another 10-15 pounds.

Wade averaged less than 20PPG that series, however had a key game 4 that was essential to avoid a 3-1 series deficit. From there it was the LeBron show.  LeBron left straight after the near sweep to the Spurs in 2014, as this was the peak season of Wade's ability decline. He could see his health has set him back where could no longer be that old D-Wade, so the timing was perfect to return home and make good on his life long promise of delivering that city a championship.  It's amazing how Wade is considered a top 3 SG despite all this adversity he had to go through with health issues that it leaves us to think - IMAGINE had wade enjoyed the health fortune of LeBron throughout his entire career. There was a reason he was growing comparisons to the young Michael Jordan during his prime years, and it wasn't a laughable comparison.  He slashed like him, shared his explosion to the rim, his relentless at playing at full intensity and throwing his body around, and delivering in crunch time moments.  He offered all of us moments that I will pass onto my kids one day, an all timer, a first ballot, and a player you could always count on, over and again.  Just as you thought he was finished over the last 3 years, he started to tease us with vintage Wade flashes and moments, like the clutch performance that stunned Charlotte against the purple shirt man. Or the return to Miami after 2 long years away, and hitting the dagger in Ben Simmons face to remind him he was a rookie."
"...whereas LeBron James DID get involved with politics, aka the opposite of avoiding it altogether. As for why it's bad, because his stance was to do what would make the most money/be best for business above anything else.  And Lebron getting involved in politics certainly isn't ""useless,"" he's a hugely influential figure who has a meaningful impact on a lot of kids and adults."
"Steph Curry is happy and confident, what a cabbage.  LeBron James, because things he doesn't have any control over like his fan base.  Lonzo, what an overrated player!  /s  On the flip side and almost as bad, lots of posts with just a name and no thoughts to share."
"&gt; Lebron's team had a ton of question marks behind it.  Yeah, no one knew if DWade, Lebron James, and Chris Bosh were going to make it. A scrappy team of underdogs really.   Not 1.. not 2.. not 3.. not 4.."
"I definitely feel this, I had a strong attachment to those guys. But hey, I would easily rather have Lonzo over D’Lo, Hart over Clarkson, Kuzma over Nance, and LeBron James over Randle. I get you though. I always envisioned that young core + 1 or 2 All-Stars holding up that trophy. We’re on our way up though! *knock on wood*"
"How Rich Paul met LeBron:  &gt; After graduating high school, Paul was buying throwback jerseys from Atlanta and selling them out of his trunk in Cleveland. In 2002 he met LeBron James at the Akron-Canton Airport, where James was impressed by Paul's authentic Warren Moon throwback jersey. The two exchanged contact information, and soon Paul had sold James a Magic Johnson Lakers jersey and a Joe Namath Rams uniform.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul"
The team with Lebron James is the correct answer to any of these hypotheticals.

Even if you take away Lebron James, the Lakers would still be in a better position they were two years ago.   r/NBA thought Magic signing with the Lakers would be a disaster and so did most of the general media because of his lolmagic tweets. I would say he's atleast been an above average Bball ops president so far"

LeBron James.   Funny part is every time he opens his mouth to speak i love the dude.   Yet his camp seems so insecure about his image and even the way people react to his play bothers me. Im willing to bet stans think hes better than he thinks he is as hes pretty humble and insightful.   But little shit like he and his camp decided not to release a goofy song because he was just alright bothers me. Something changed and he used to be one of my favorites (the dance battle at the asg is still one of my favorite moments).   I cant put my finger on any particular thing HE did and i acknowledge its unreasonable because hes the only guy I judge based on their fanbase. 
"Lonzo Ball/ Rajon Rondo  Jimmy Butler/?   Brandon Ingram/Lance Stephenson  Lebron James/Micheal Beasley  Javale McGee/Ivica Zubac  How do you like this for the Lakers?

If I was Lebron, I'd be pissed that I go back to having a bench that will erase the leads in a hurry.  "

"You are right in that the bench mob struggled these playoffs, DRTG is a  terrible way to frame your argument but they did struggle.  Delon: Had a great playoff, was great defensively (especially in the Wizards series) 3pt shot was falling and some nice clutch moments. Delon was one of our better players this playoffs.  Fred: Came off a shoulder tear and his performance in the playoffs suffered because of it.  Poeltl Couldn't handle the physicality of the playoffs, was pushed around too easy by stronger bigs (Mahinmi, Gortat, Love, TT even James)  Pascal: Wasnt much of a factor in the playoffs, his defence is good for a PF but other teams didn't guard him in the half court at all. Better in the Wizards series but wasnt strong enough to keep up with Lebron or Love.  OG: Great playoffs, hit clutch shots, played great defense on every one of his assignments, 3pt shot was falling regularly. Came away impressed. Not his fault James will be James.   They struggled for various reasons but its important to note that by the end of the season especially in the seasons other teams started adjusting to the bench mob.  They would stagger their starters in to play against our bench in order to negate their impact. Wizards did this with John Wall and the Cavs did this with Lebron playing 40+ mins a game. So impact stats like DRTG are incredible misleading in this case.  "

"Stevens: “You know, everybody talks about the Eastern Conference finals. We haven’t played Toronto in a series yet and Toronto dominated the East last year. And Philly is outstanding and Milwaukee is outstanding and Indiana is outstanding. You don’t know who’s going to separate themselves. These guys, Cleveland, has more guys back than anyone else with playoff and Finals experience. So like at the end of the day, you never know what’s going to happen.”  Horford: “In the past it hasn’t mattered who we were going up against, but there’s always been that LeBron factor. Even if he was here this year, I feel really good about our group and our team.”  McMillan: “With LeBron being gone, I think you’re going to see more of the traditional power forward come back into the game and play more with two bigs as opposed to the spread offense throughout the conference.  With LeBron playing, you had to play small ball because of where he was at on the floor because of the things he was capable of doing. It will be interesting to see how this conference, the style of play, it could go back to more of when the East was more of a grind type of conference and the West was more of a run and gun style of play.”  Love, in response to McMillan on this point: “I just think the game has trended to pace and space so much that I don’t see it happening. I think he wants to believe…  I think he thinks Myles Turner is a traditional 4.    Love: “Which he’s not. Sabonis, I understand what he’s saying there, but he’s not even a traditional center, so to speak.”  Ainge: “We’re trying to be what LeBron’s teams have been, the Miami teams and the Cleveland teams, and return to our days in Celtic glory. We’re trying to put up our own banners in Boston and have our own identity with this new group of guys.”  ￼  Al Horford. (Greg Cooper / USA Today)  What it’s like, though, to go up against LeBron, time and again, a trip to the Finals maybe riding on the line? And lose? Over and over?  Stevens: “We had 42 players our first 18 months. But that was part of it when we came in — there was an understanding that it was going to take a while. And I think getting to that second year (2014-15), finishing 25-11 when Isaiah (Thomas) came here and getting to the playoffs was enormous. Getting swept by the Cavs was enormous for us. It was a tremendous opportunity to see how far we had to go, but also kind of a whet your appetite for wanting more. And every year we’ve been able to taste a little bit more.”  Horford: “He’s a huge reason why they were where they were, but I never looked at it like ‘me against him.’ One of their consistencies was they shot the ball great from 3 and the pace they played always gave us problems. You understand LeBron is a great player and he’s going to do what he does. You try to limit him, but you’re not getting caught up in all of him.”  Casey: “We tried a little bit of everything. But, again, I will say this, to stop him is personnel driven. You’ve got to have somebody that physically, mentally, and basketball IQ wise can hold him up. We had a lot of other good pieces around in DeRozan and (Kyle) Lowry and an up-and-coming, young kid in OG Anunoby, but he was just so young. You’ve got to have something that’s a lot like LeBron.”  Webster: “I think in the moment you’re always ‘why not us?’ Why can’t we be this year? His level of success has to drop off at some point. And then after the fact, obviously, you see his excellence and what he can do to you.”  Tristan Thompson, Cavs center: “Of course, yes, we had LeBron, but at the same time we all had big moments. We all had big moments in that journey to win. It wasn’t like LeBron scored 100 and everyone else has two points.”  ￼  (Nathanial S. Butler / Getty Images)  You know, Boston, and you too, Indiana, you guys were really, really close to knocking off LeBron last spring. Game 7s, in fact. It’s like, you had him.  McMillan: “We did have a chance. Absolutely we had a chance, but we didn’t do it. We didn’t get it done.  Stevens: We had a chance. I don’t think you ever say you should’ve won. It’s always more fair to say you could’ve won … but there’s no question that last game hurt and it was a real impetus moving into the summer.”  Horford: “We were minutes away from reaching the Finals and they edged us. That’s a credit to LeBron and how he was able to put that team on his back and get it done.”  Stevens: “The one thing I’d say is LeBron was tremendous, obviously. But if you looked at it from a points-per-possession metric versus how he’s been the rest of his career, we were pretty good defensively. He was still tremendous. He was still the MVP of that series and everything else, but I felt we guarded him in a pretty efficient way overall. And I didn’t think defense was our issue.”  I mean, Brad, you almost won without your two best players (Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward). That’s remarkable.  Stevens: “I’m not really into ranking our players, but we had two guys that had been named All-Stars out, and we had (Daniel) Theis out. All three probably would’ve played some, but the thing I’ve always loved about this team is there’s never been an excuse in anybody’s mind in this building. We all were stung by the fact that we came up short, and kind of that next person step up or fearless mentality is probably why we were where we were.”  Dwane, even in the last sweep, you had some close calls. Do you catch yourself thinking about LeBron’s game-winner off the glass from Game 3?  Casey:  “We were supposed to trap, we didn’t trap. And you see that ball go in and say ‘woulda coulda, shoulda.’ I think more about Game 1. We had four tip ins at the bucket to win the game and not let it go to overtime. That was more us than Game 3. I thought that was our golden opportunity to put them on their heels and have a chance to win the series. Not only were they more vulnerable. I thought we had improved. I thought our players had improved, our confidence level, our 3-point shooting, our offense was better, our defense was better. All the facets for us, if not more so than Cleveland not being where they used to be, I thought it was our chance to win it.”  ￼  Brad Stevens. (Getty Images)  Right, so, it did seem the Cavs were more vulnerable last season than in playoffs past. What do you make of them now, this season, with LeBron gone?  McMillan: Now that he’s gone, I think they’re going to be playing with a lot of freedom. Expectations have changed. You knew where the ball was going to be when LeBron was here. Now they’re going to have a lot of ball movement. And sometimes teams like that are just as dangerous because you don’t know where the attack is going to come from. Clarkson and Hood, those guys are talented players. They didn’t play like some people wanted them to play last year. I think they’re going to be more relaxed and be able to play better basketball for Cleveland. I think they’re going to be OK. Are they a championship team? Of course it’s going to be a challenge without LeBron, but there’s still a lot of talent in that locker room.”  Osman: “We’re going to have a lot of things to learn and we’re going to have a chance to prove a lot of people wrong and I think we can do that.”  Stevens: “When you lose a player of LeBron’s caliber, it’s a tremendous opportunity for other guys who are very accomplished and really believe in themselves. And I don’t think there’s a better example than last year, with us. We lost a player with Kyrie’s caliber and it was just more opportunity for other guys. You wish Kyrie was still there, you wish Gordon was still there. But at the end of the day, when good players get opportunity, anything can happen.”  Webster: “There’s no substitute for all of those playoff runs. And to suggest that all of a sudden that those guys are going to forget how to win I think is probably an injustice to them for everything they accomplished.”  Reporting from Cleveland, Boston, East Lansing, Mich., and Toronto.

"No one knows the pain of losing to LeBron James in the playoffs quite like Al Horford.  Well, except for maybe Dwane Casey.  Horford’s last two seasons with the Atlanta Hawks ended the same way: playoff sweeps at the hands of LeBron and the Cavs. Once in the Eastern finals, in 2015, and the following year in the conference semis.  So Horford signs with the Celtics as a free agent in 2016, and guess what? A gentleman’s sweep out of the 2017 conference finals and then a Game 7 loss last year. To LeBron.  Casey is coaching the Detroit Pistons now instead of the Toronto Raptors. Guess why?  Casey’s Raptors locked up with the Cavs in the 2016 Eastern finals. After splitting the first four games, LeBron’s team dismissed Toronto in Games 5 and 6 and went on to win the Finals over the Warriors. The next year, in the conference semis, the Cavs swept Casey’s Raptors. And last season, after finishing No. 1 in the East during the regular season and setting a franchise record with 59 wins, Toronto was, yes, swept again by LeBron’s side in the second round. The Raptors fired Casey straight away.  The devastation LeBron inflicted upon the Eastern Conference is vast. For eight straight seasons, on two different teams, James dominated like no one since the Celtics of the 1960s.  In the process of reeling off eight consecutive Finals berths and three NBA titles, James caused firings and trades by his East rivals. He broke up one dynasty and canceled others before they began. He bled opponents dry in emasculating, four-game sweeps, and cut their hearts out in dramatic Game 7s.  You know LeBron’s story, including the part where he left the Cavs and the conference for the Lakers. It means for the first time since 2010, a non-LeBron team will rep the East in the Finals come June.  The Celtics look like the favorite, but the Sixers, the Raptors, the Pacers, the Bucks — they’re all feeling really good heading into this season. Better, at least by a little, than at the starts of the last several seasons. We know why.  Over the past few weeks, The Athletic sat with some of the players, the coaches, and the executives LeBron left behind in the East. Whoever is fortunate enough to rise from the rubble will do so through a combination of discipline, luck, and lessons he bestowed upon them.  LeBron’s Reign of Terror Teams w/multiple playoff losses to LeBron over the last eight years Celtics: 2012 (finals); 2015 (first round); 2017 (finals); 2018 (finals) Pacers: 2012 (semis); 2013 (finals); 2014 (finals); 2017 (1st rd.); 2018 (1st rd.) Raptors: 2016 (finals); 2017 (semis); 2018 (semis) Bulls: 2011 (finals); 2013 (semis); 2015 (semis) Hawks: 2015 (finals); 2016 (semis)  (Writer’s note: Questions below are paraphrased from original conversations, with liberties taken for reader entertainment)  So, uh, LeBron’s gone from the East. Thoughts?  Kevin Love, Cavs All-Star forward: “I know Dwane Casey is probably upset.”  Casey: “I’m sure (the Raptors) don’t feel it was shortsighted. I’m sure they feel it was a great decision, which is their prerogative. On my side it felt shortsighted.”  Bobby Webster, Raptors general manager: “I think it was a great high for the city and it was a great high for the franchise and for the playoffs to win 59 and go in as the No. 1 seed, but I don’t think that suggests that in some way things changed. You’ve got to beat the champs to become the champs.”  (Note: Webster was speaking generally about the Raptors’ playoff failure last season and not responding directly to Casey.)  Horford: “Last year was the first year that I could kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel, because before it’s been a struggle. His teams have had their way against the teams that I’ve been a part of. That’s why I was a little disappointed that he went West, because this year it’s the year that we have as good a chance as I’ve ever had.”  Danny Ainge, Celtics general manager: “I have all the respect in the world for LeBron and his greatness in his career, but we were not hoping that he was going to leave.”  Jonas Valanciunas, Raptors center: “I never preferred taking an easier way. I prefer beating him, but he left. It’s frustrating. We wanted to win. It’s not good to lose against anybody. Doesn’t matter if he’s Superman or whatever you want to call him. It’s not good to lose.”  Nate McMillan, Pacers coach: “I think it impacts the entire Eastern Conference. Eight years the kid went to the Finals with two different teams. Whether he was in Cleveland or in Miami, he was the team to beat. With him being gone, Boston is a favorite, Toronto is another team to beat in this conference.”  Ainge: “I wasn’t obsessed with LeBron.”  Love: “I just called my agent to see what it meant moving forward. I had talked to Koby (Altman, Cavs GM, before LeBron’s announcement), and I was like, ‘I want to be here regardless. I know there’s a lot of stuff to figure out and Bron’s going to make his decision one way or the other.’ And I just basically called my agent and said ‘does this change anything for the landscape of our team?’ I talked to Bron too, which you guys know.”  Casey: “With LeBron leaving, you always think ‘woulda, coulda, shoulda.’ That’s spilled milk and you can’t get it back in the bottle. I’m very thankful to be where I am and in a great situation with Detroit.”  ￼  LeBron James against the Celtics. (Ken Blaze / USA Today)  Entire teams have broken up over losing to LeBron. The Celtics, once. Pacers, twice. Hawks. Bulls. Raptors, basically, with Casey and DeMar DeRozan.  Ainge, about his own rebuild when the Heat took over the East: “We were just trying to get good. We’d beaten LeBron before with good teams and we were just trying to get to be as good of a team as we were from 2008 to 2012. We were trying to return to that.”  Casey: “The history of the NBA, you’ve had the Chicago rivalries, Detroit-Chicago, Detroit-Boston rivalries. You get to the edge and you just can’t get over that hump. That’s where we were in Toronto, we just couldn’t get over the hump of beating Cleveland. We’re in the conference finals and two semifinal years. Everybody acted like there was doom and gloom in Toronto, and we were winning. It’s not like we weren’t winning. Did we win the championship? No. But a lot of other teams didn’t either to get over that hump.”  Webster: “Obviously the Eastern Conference finals year, we made it as far as we ever made it. We lose those first two games. We come home and win two. We’re kind of like, we’re in this thing. It was a tough playoffs up to that point, we had won two Game 7s and our guys were tired. You lose those first two, they weren’t that close in Cleveland, and then to come back here and win two and you’re like ‘OK, it’s anyone’s ball game.’ I think other years we went in thinking we had a team more suited for them and then we get swept twice. Ultimately it wasn’t that close.”  Ainge, on the Pacers: “Trading Paul George was not tearing down their team. Trading Paul George was, they were sort of forced into it, weren’t they? Paul George had played unbelievable and played fantastic against LeBron (in 2017). If anything they would’ve thought they were really close to beating LeBron, the way he played in his last playoff series against LeBron. I think it’s just different. I think they were able to recover in a tough situation by moving Paul George and getting Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. That was a fantastic recovery by Indiana and they’re a very good team in the East, but I don’t think losing to LeBron they completely changed how their whole view was. If Paul George wanted another crack at LeBron, then he might’ve stayed at Indiana.”  "
"Cavs had LeBron James and they were in the East, call me when Nuggets have those two things "
"Kyrie is one of a few players in the entire league who gets BETTER in the playoffs. If you look at regular season vs playoffs, almost every player statistically gets worse, even Kevin Durant and James Harden.

1 LeBron James 
You honestly believe no one talented will ever join Lebron James (the greatest player of his generation) at the Lakers (the most famous and popular team in NBA history) in the next 4 years ?
No they all do that now. LeBron James takes four steps sometimes. I don’t know why I am getting down voted.  I guess people don’t want to admit that the NBA is now more entertainment than a legitimate competitive sport.
It’s funny that when lebron pulled the OG superteam move we heard none of this. Running through a conference where a Jeff Teague led team was the biggest challenger year in and out or better yet Kenna Walker lol is not remarkable either. No team had the collective talent as the Wade-Bosh-James heat teams or the Irving-Love-James Cavs. So how is his finals run remarkable? You have to criticize both sides or none at all. 
"I mean Lebron James opened up a school for underprivileged youth in Ohio that gives them a ton of resources to succeed, get their parents in a better position,and help them further their education after highschool.  I would say he is going to the good place"
Lol stop acting like these glimpses into superstars' lives isn't entertaining. It used to be we only saw them on the court and always wondered what they were like off it. Now we can get these glimpses bc of social media. If it was yours or my IG post that was on the front page sure it's like wtf. But it's LeBron fucking James.
LeBron is not even fit to carry MJ'S jockstrap. Jordan won multiple scoring titles and DPOY while James doesn't give a shit on defense.
"&gt;I know what you mean about Harden's game particularly the waiting for the mistake part. But Lbj does that too he just doesn't rely on lots of dribble moves to tempt defenders like Harden. They both have their own preferred styles but the result is the same.   No offense intended my dude but how do you think he's able to not rely on dribbling to get by? Athleticism and raw unmatched power, coordination and speed. All athletic gifts. I know Lebron does the same. He plays smart. He plays to the defense. Same with other high IQ guys like CP3. But Lebron can bulldoze his way to the rim. Harden can't do that.    &gt;If you want to talk about Lebron 2011 we can bring up Harden 2017. Harden in 2017 was a year older than Lebron in 2011 as well.   That was to illustrate the point that no one is truly impossible to defend. Not a shot at him. Western teams like the Spurs and Dallas have found successful ways that neutralized even the best player in the world. That's my point.   However Lebron in 2011 had **two other all stars** on his team and Harden was a lone wolf and **only offensive creator** on his team (so he was easier to shut down; all that was needed was one bad game). Harden otherwise played great the rest of that series.   He took an elbow from Gasol in the 4th quarter of the game where they went to OT and was [most likely concussed](https://nesn.com/2017/05/nba-executive-thinks-james-harden-might-have-been-concussed-vs-spurs/amp/). He looked completely out of it for the rest of that game. And we all know what happened for that last game. He was missing passes/shots and looked out of it. Rockets didn't report it before the last game bc doing so was throwing the towel and he most likely still wanted to try and play. And it was never reported after the loss or used as an excuse bc the organization could get into trouble for hiding it to let him play the last game.   And IMO being a year older isn't advantageous in any way when Lebron has been playing since he was 18.   "
Lebron James or Michael Jordan
LeBron Raymone James Sr.
Awww you’re all defensive now. I know I hurt your feelings boy. A thunder fan doesn’t think lakers with lebron James will make the playoffs lmfaooo. “538 has them at 9th” bahaha you bring up a random website to decide for you. How sad is your life.   This kid brings up 538 in an argument and what they think lakers will be placed lmaoooo 
You missed when they got lebron James? 
Brandon Ingram wins MIP. The Houston Rockets upset the Warriors in the WCF. LeBron James wins MVP. 
"Will say this again Never count out a LeBron James led team, the Lakers team this year is way more talented than the Cavs last year."
so many salty Lakers fans here? like you got LeBron fucking James and you're still pissed PG didn't think your 35 win team was worthy?
Lebron James does this a lot aswell. Don't think they call it that often.
"1. James Harden   Don't know why people keep underestimating him. He's still playing with CP3 and Capela, and a decent supporting cast of role players. Staff/personnel are pretty much the same. I'd say he's still the front runner if he puts up another 28/7/8 stat line and HOU finishes a top 2 seed (55+ wins).   &amp;#x200B;  2. LeBron James  If the Lakers win at least 50 and finish as a top 3 seed, then he'll have a decent shot. It all really depends on how he's going to approach the regular season and how well Ingram/Ball/Kuzma/Hart will play.  &amp;#x200B;  3. Anthony Davis  Again, top 3 seed (50+ wins) and career best numbers. Unlike Harden and Lebron, he's not playing with any other All Stars so he can lay a greater claim to his team's success.   Dark Horse: Giannis Antetokounmpo  He's never stopped improving since his rookie year and I don't think he'll stop now. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he put up 30/11/6 on 55% FG and 35% 3pt. He just needs to be on a better team. "
"How is lebron the best all around player when he does not play defense? People need to accept that durant, davis, harden and curry are at least on the same level or better than him. I refuse to factor in past accomplishments when looking at current rankings. I absolutely believe Durant is better than a 34 year old no defense playing James. "
Must be horrible to have 80 championships and Lebron James
Lebron “ben simmons” james
"At one point in a scrimmage, sources said, Lebron turned to GM Magic Johnson and screamed, ""You (bleeping) need me. You can't win without me."" James left teammates and coaches largely speechless. He dominated the gym in every way. Lebron's back."

Simmons is not currently better than Lebron James but he has a high ceiling 
inb4 you have a [LAL] Lebron James flair
"To tell you the truth I didn't want LA to go after Butler anyways. It's not that he isn't a good player, it's just that I don't trust his knee for the next four years at max money.  Perfect World I would love Klay Thompson but I really doubt that's even a possibility. I don't think the warriors will let him go and he has no desire to leave either. But he is the perfect max player to slide in next to LeBron, a good defender who is known as a great teammate and is probably the second best three point shooter in the league. He has the length and skill to guard multiple positions and his offensive game doesn't overlap with James."
Will Lebron James have chance of winning another MVP? Gee I have to think about that one
i feel like it's pretty common as a convention when talking about the nba to use the more distinctive name when you only use one  **LeBron** James  Kevin **Durant**  **Carmelo** Anthony  James **Harden**
"It honestly made me fucking furious and I'm not even a Cavalier fan. Cedi was like a pro in europe before coming over here. He was incredible in that 76ers game on the road. I honestly wonder if Lue came back and didn't look at any tape from previous games (I understand if this is the case because he needed a mental health break) but holy shit... I felt like JR Smith was an abomination through most of the playoffs. You had a backcourt of Hill/Smith that couldn't average a combined 18-20 points per game? Sometimes scoring under 5 points combined per game. If LeBron got ANY offensive production from these guys they might have made the finals interesting. Nance, Love, James, Korver, Osman or fucking Calderon was killing it under Larry Drew. "
"Reality has dictated Livingston is 3/4 and LeBron James is 1/4, Livingston must have a greater impact on winning championships then "
"You shouldn't be so dismissive of other people's problems just because they have money. Coaching Lebron automatically brings in a ton of media scrutiny and pressure and second guessing of everything you've ever done. Considering that Ty Lue literally had to leave the team for a 2 week stretch of the season due to anxiety problems, all that extra attention can be a curse for sure.  &gt;When Tyronn Lue [stepped away](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/03/19/cavs-coach-tyronn-lue-takes-leave-of-absence-citing-chest-pains-and-other-health-issues/?utm_term=.3bbaf2407a5d) from the Cleveland Cavaliers for two weeks in March, he said he was experiencing “chest pains and other troubling symptoms, compounded by a loss of sleep,” and that “there have been no conclusions as to what the exact issue is.” Cleveland’s coach now knows he was suffering from anxiety, and he claimed recently that he was feeling much better after changing his diet and being placed on medication....Lue, who coached the Cavs to the NBA title in 2016, said all the extra “attention” he has gotten as the coach of a perennial contender with James has been uncomfortable at times. However, the fact that he has so much “love \[for\] coaching” makes it all “worth it,” even if it can be difficult to keep his personal well-being in mind.

LeBron James? 
"That's more about Kobe's rep than LeBron getting preferential treatment I think. Kinda reminds me of a somewhat old article...  &gt;For example, could anyone else in the entire NBA get away with saying “If I’m on the team, you automatically have to be unselfish?” If Kobe said that, you’d take it to mean that Kobe expected everyone on his team to pass him the ball, but when LeBron said it earlier this season, everyone took it to mean LeBron was merely promoting better ball movement and better defensive effort… despite the fact that LeBron, throughout his career, has actually averaged more shots per game (19.8) than Kobe (19.6).   &gt;Actually, let’s get out of the hypothetical. In 2006, when Kobe Bryant took only three shots in the second half in a loss to the Phoenix Suns, some reporters called his action “the most selfish act” in years.   &gt;Meanwhile, this season, when LeBron took just six shots in the final three quarters of a loss to Portland, ESPN’s Brian Windhorst wrote LeBron made a “conscious decision on how he plans to operate in a passive-aggressive mission to yank some teammates toward his way of thinking” in an article entitled “LeBron Opts for New Leadership Style.” Cleveland.com wrote a similar piece and titled it, “LeBron James’ Lack of Points, Shots are Intended to Break ‘Bad Habits’ of Cleveland Cavaliers’ Past.” "
The alley to James that he spread his arms out for because it signified the marriage between him and LeBron

"I'm a warriors fan.  Let's talk competitive balance in the league.    KD gets blamed for ruining the competitive balance in the league, and I gotta say, I get it.  He made the warriors super-powerful and decimated the warriors' closest competitor.  I get all the media types and the fans who are savaging KD.  If I wasn't a warriors fan, I wouldn't be savaging KD, though, because I'm also a 49ers fan and an Oakland A's fan.  Since 2014, those 2 franchises have combined for 1 winning season (the A's, this season).  The 49ers haven't had a winning season since 2013, when they were beaten in the NFC Title Game by Seattle.    What is the difference between these 3 franchises that I root for?  One word:   Ownership.  The warriors have the best ownership, the A's ownership is pitiful and won't spend a dime to improve the team (the A's had the lowest opening day payroll this year) and the 49ers are owned by the Yorks.  I'm old enough to remember the 49ers under Eddie Debartalo, the dynasty era, when money was, quite literally, no object.    If KD leaves the warriors in free agency, the warriors will still be good and they'll build another title team shortly.  Joe Lacob spares no expense.  The same way the Lakers spare no expense.  The same way the Celtics spare no expense.  Sensing a trend?  The franchises with the consistently best owners ALWAYS field title contenders.  The Lakers going 5 years without a playoff spot is an eternity, and now, they have good young players and Lebron.  Good ownership makes it happen.    KD didn't destroy the league's competitive balance.  CLAY BENNET FUCKING DID, when he wouldn't pay James Harden what Harden was worth to save a bit on the luxury tax.  Penny-wise, Pound-foolish, because that move has cost the OKC ownership a BOATLOAD in tax this year.  You think KD wasn't paying attention when Bennet wouldn't pay Harden?  He was paying attention.    The single most monumental thing you could do to improve competitive balance is to allow fans a vote of no confidence in ownership, and that an owner MUST sell if such a vote passes.  Obviously, you need some stability, so if a new owner buys a team, he's exempt from a vote for 10 years after buying the team, but after that?  No confidence = must sell.    Its not the players, its the sorry ass owners.  My team was owned by Chris Cohan for 15+ seasons.  How many playoff berths did the warriors get in those 15+ seasons?  Answer: 1, the ""We Believe"" year.  How may in the 9 since Lacob has owned the team?  Answer: 6, and 3 titles.    I have the benefit of having seen both really bad and really good owners own all 3 of my teams.  The A's last won when the Haas family (good owners) owned the team, they've been competitive on shoe-string budgets since then because of the brilliance of Billy Beane.  The 49ers were great when Eddie D owned the team, and have been terrible in the York years.  They only won games when the Yorks needed to win in order to get their new stadium in Santa Clara past the voters.  Once York got Levi's Stadium, the 49ers cut payroll and haven't field a winning team, or a team close to the salary cap, since then.  The warriors were horrible during the CC era ownership, and then the IRS investigated him for tax fraud and he needed money so he sold the team to Lacob.  The highlights of the Cohan ownership?  Blown draft picks (Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, Joe Smith over Kevin Garnett, Mike Dunleavy Jr. over Nene and Amare Stoudamire, and others, far, far too lengthy to list), horrific free agency decisions (backing up the brinks' truck for Adonal Folye and Derek Fisher), bad coaches, bad front office, and Choke-Gate.  Ownership changes everything.     Why are so many fans dumping on the players?  If you don't have good ownership, it DOESN'T MATTER who your players are, you will lose.  "
"I agree, as Lebron has always been a candidate for the award year after year. I mean, he carried the Cavs to the finals last season compared to a superior supporting cast for James Harden (even though he did have a fantastic season!). I think the line is being pushed and pulled in one of two directions each season - individual success vs team success. There is never a clear balance between the two. For example, when Russell Westbrook took home MVP honours even though the Thunder placed 6th."
"It was around 2.30 AM here. I was just about to hit the sack when I decided to refresh Reddit once again just in case and the top post in 'new' was that SI reporter's tweet about LeBron signing with the Lakers. I was like ""Yeah, this is another one of those fake posts, why do I even bother?"". I F5 again and BOOM! 3 posts about Woj reporting LeBron's a Laker. I started pacing up and down my apartment and couldn't help but to start laughing like a maniac. I was even afraid I might wake up my girlfriend, but I honestly didn't care. After seemingly 10 years of hearing about it, LEBRON JAMES was a LAKER. I had to light up another one just to calm myself enough to go to sleep."
"Buddy Hield is a great piece of example for why maybe teams like the Kings should be contracted.  Players like Michael Jordan, Buddy Hield, LeBron James, Magic Johnson - they are so great for the NBA.  Burying one away in Sacramento is such a missed opportunity. It's just so bad for league, it's bad for the player. And most importantly, it's bad for the fan  "
"&gt;Dwight Howard doesn't compare but Chris Paul does. Remember him? lol   Yeah and it was one year and his first year playing with a true all star and he got the MVP.    &gt;Wrong. Just based on last year. You are wrong lmao.   So 2 years out of 6. Ok. Still dipped in scoring a majority of those years. And last year technically isn't the same. He still had Love on that team.    &gt;Boston and Utah were tied for the best defense last year. Harden faced Utah and Lebron faced Boston.   Boston took them to 7 and nearly won. Utah were beat pretty easily. Boston was top defense mainly against *Eastern teams*. Utah was mainly facing *Western teams*. The East is **the weaker conference** lol. So Harden faced a tougher defense in Utah and still managed to make Gobert look silly.    &gt;And don't try and get cute with muh 'Western Conference'. If we look at Harden's scoring vs the Warriors and Lebron's scoring vs the Warriors it's the same difference.   Can you provide the stats on that please?    &gt;Kobe's scoring always went down in the playoffs. So it's Jordan and Lebron.   It actually didn't. **You're wrong**. Literally in his rookie season it jumped a small bit from 7.6 to 8.2. From 2000 to 2003 his scoring literally jumped every year in the playoffs. From 06 to 09 it jumped every single year as well. And in 2011, his last year in the playoffs it also jumped.   Check BBref if you don't believe me. I'm not doing copy/paste for all that. The other ones took long enough.    &gt;Using your physicality is still a skill. People act like Lebron's body type is so unique in the NBA but it's not. Jae Crowder and Josh Smith for example are similar to Lebron's body. The difference between them is natural talent and skill.   No one is saying Lebron isn't skilled. And comparing him to Crowder or Smith in that way to make a point is just disingenuous.   What they're saying is he doesn't rely on those skills as much as he relies on his athleticism and his size when driving to the basket. Harden on the other hand uses his skills to get by guys. He doesn't use his freakish athletic genetics bc he doesn't have that. So Harden is a more skilled scorer. James is a more athletic scorer.   Harden is harder to guard bc with James you know what's coming and its little to no chance that you'll stop him. With Harden you have no idea what he'll do to you. Will he step back and splash a 3? Will he drive and lob? Will he drive and kick? Will he drive and score? Will he drive and draw a foul? Will he drive and go back for a mid range step back? Will he post you up and give you a post step back? He's got so many tricks in his bag and he's elite at all of them. He's always got his defender guessing.   James will barrel through you and use his size and speed to do so. A 6'5 Lebron wouldn't be able to do some of the things real life Lebron can.  "

Players like Michael Jordan, Kevin Garnett, LeBron James, Magic Johnson - they are so great for the NBA.   Burying one away in Minnesota is such a missed opportunity.

"&gt; Shaq was a bad man but he was never that bad  I'm sorry but no.  Prime Shaq was the baddest motherfucker that ever lived other than maybe prime MJ.  Forget crossing half court, Shaq was so dominant that he changed other people's rosters just by existing in the league.  Dudes like Ervin Johnson [(no, that's not a typo)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnser02.html) and Jerome James and Erick Dampier and Chris Dudley made hundreds of millions just so teams had someone who was strong enough, who could foul Shaq hard enough to stop him from dunking anyway.  And yes, he does have glaring flaws- iso perimeter defense, post offense, post defense, offensive rebounding, etc. etc. etc.   It's just that you give Curry a pass because he's a guard- the same way, the only flaws that Shaq had are things that you forgive because he's a classic center.  The all arounders I mentioned, guys like Kobe and MJ and KD and Lebron, those are guys that *actually* have no glaring weaknesses."
"I’m sure they will be, and they fucking should, they have LeBron James on their team!   And I never said it would be disappointing for the Lakers (although I imagine the Front Office might be a *little* let down maybe), I was more talking about how LeBron might be disappointed. I’m not necessarily saying he would regret his decision, but he might be a little disappointed, no?"
"Westbrook 2017 and Jordan 1988 are the obvious outliers, and both had extraordinary stat lines.  Even so, the Bulls were 3rd in the East when Jordan won.  For Westbrook to win on a 6th-seed team is unprecedented in the modern era, but so was averaging a triple double.  Just don't count on anyone from a 6th seed team winning again any time soon.  That's why I don't see LeBron James as an MVP favorite this year.  His team isn't going to grab a top-2 seed in the West.  Maybe if they come in third and he has an extraordinary stat line he'll have a chance, but I don't think the team is good enough to do that, either.  The MVP is overwhelmingly likely to come from a top two team in the West or a top two team in the East."
"and actually, crazy as it may sound, LeBron was better than Curry when it came to the deep 3 this past season: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/"
Wait what? You think he's gonna be out of a job 1 year after signing LeBron James to a 4 year contract?   What the actual fuck...?
"LeBron since this is the chance to go for 3 MVP's on 3 different teams while there is no championship expectation. Lakers O/U is set at around 48 round now, he can get them to 50+ and a top 4 seeding I could see it happening.   Everyone forgetting about James fucking Harden though. He has great value at +650, maybe people just don't like the narrative since he already won one(and should have won 2017 as well). His team will win 60+ and get the 1st or 2nd seed again. Curry and Durant cancel each other out so they can't get it. I don't see why he wouldn't win if the Rockets are the top seed and he has similar averages. "

This kinda sounds like Brad Beal saying Jeff Green plays like Lebron James. 
It’s Lebron James look what he’s done. He can get you there he just needs a finisher 
"I think Magic Johnson himself would tell you the Lakers would have failed if they didn't at least make an NBA Finals in the next 4 years, and I think it's difficult to see a clear path without adding another star.   Plus, frankly, it's Los Angeles, the Lakers, and LeBron James. If you can't get *one* all-star to join up, then that's a failure."
"[LeBron James](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html) says hello, [James Harden](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html) says goodbye.  &amp;#x200B;  24 seasons combined, 23 with more than 70 games played(or the percentage equivalent in the lockout season) in the RS.  Butler has 7 seasons with only 2 seasons of more than 70 games played(or percentage equivalent for the lockout season) in the RS.  I get your point that no one is ""guaranteed"" 70+ games but Butler is highly unlikely to play 70+ whereas some of his peers are almost a guaranteed too(LeBron missed it once playing 69 games)."
Yeah cause Magic and Bird literally had teams as good as KDs warriors around them    Would the warriors be okay if houston added lebron James?    Only 2 competetive teams every year and basically have a 50/50 shot at winning. No need for Larry to leave because he played beside 4 all star caliber players even though mchale and parish get all the praise as birds sidekicks and magic played with 3 all star caliber players  one of which was arguably a player better than magic and another that was a hall of famer letalone all star caliber  and one of the best wing defenders ever    Sorry for the million spelling errors.

This issue comes when people who say they're fans of a team that doesn't have Lebron James but will still fight tooth and nail to tell you how much better he is than everyone. 90% of the time it's fans of mediocre teams that got dicked one too many times by LBJ. Pistons, Hawks, Wizards fans are about as likely to talk about Lebron as they are to talk about their own team."
Lakers were 1-2 at this point last season. By my calculation LeBron James has made the Lakers and Cavs worse by changing teams. Most toxic teammate ever?
Your team is so bad you're struggling to get wins with *Lebron James*. Despite years of tanking and being garbage to get talent. 
"[Meyer] LeBron James walking out of the Cavs locker room after game 1... ""Fuck you, Jr!"" Jr Smith: ""Love you, LeBron"""
"LeBron James, walking out of the 2018 free agency last night...  “Fuck you, Dan!""  Dan Gilbert: “Love you, LeBron.”"
I don't care about the details of how he won because duh he swept the Raptors.  Lebron still got swept and didn't win a ring. That's all that matters to me. Thanks KD!  Why should you dictate that I'm not satisfied? Move on after a tough season and come back stronger. Revenge on lebron? I can't control that.  All I'm hoping for right now is his Lakers team to be swept or not make the playoffs. Oh and hey hopefully he never wins a ring again. LeFlop james is never on the same tier as michael jordan.  Oh too bad r/nba doesn't have a bronsexual flair

"Scoring doesn't lead to many assists, it leads to points and turnovers. Passing leads to assists and turnovers. Fucking Kobe Bryant is one of the greatest scorers ever and he is top 5 in all-time turnovers but only averaged 4 assists per game. Dude only averaged 1 more assist than turnovers per game. Players who take on the primary scoring and playmaking burden of their teams suffer from alot of turnovers. James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Allen Iverson, pre-MVP Curry, and Lebron are great examples of that. Those dudes had to take on a huge burden in scoring and facilitating and therefore had a ton of turnovers to go along with a mountain of assists. "
OP’s record against LeBron James head to head including playoffs: 0-0
and lets not act like everyone on here loves lebron. dude has earned people's respect and admiration for what he's accomplished on the basketball court. embiid will continue to get the james harden treatment until he accomplishes something. 
He's a good journalist that has to exaggerate or change his opinions to get more attention. If he came on everyday and said the obvious shit and said things that everybody agreed with nobody would watch.   In the same way I'm sure Skip Bayless respects Lebron James as a player/person he still has to point out the negative aspect of Lebron every single time. People want to see Skip shit on Lebron. People want to see SAS say something crazy. It's the nature of things.
"&gt;	Why are you reading this crummy sports column?  &gt;You’re supposed to be sleeping. Getting a nap in. Two naps, truthfully.  &gt;One nap so you can stay up to watch NBA basketball. Then another nap so you can stay up to watch the World Series.  &gt;On Monday, the Journal ran a front-page story from my sports colleague Ben Cohen about the NBA’s insomnia season. The league’s shiniest talent (the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers, now with LeBron James) is clustered out West, meaning a lot of 10:30 p.m. ET starts, and a lot of post-1 a.m. ET finishes.  &gt;Did you see the big fight in the Laker-Rockets game the other night? No, you did not. You were fast asleep, dreaming about playing golf with pizza-making robots.  &gt;Then there’s the World Series. These games start at a more reasonable time for East Coasters, 8:09 p.m. ET or something, but baseball games now last longer than Springsteen farewell shows. The Red Sox and Dodgers played for nearly four hours (3:52) over nine innings in Game 1 Tuesday.  &gt;Four hours. Nine innings. And the Red Sox, 8-4 winners, didn’t even need to hit in the bottom of the ninth.  &gt;Baseball has been making noise about trying to accelerate the pace of play. The trouble is game management. You ever have nightmare family games of Monopoly that lasted all night? That’s what baseball games have become. There is tinkering atop tinkering, adjustments atop adjustments. On Tuesday Boston and Los Angeles combined to throw 12 pitchers. Twelve!  &gt;I get it: It’s the World Series. The stakes couldn’t be higher. Part of the reason the Red Sox and Dodgers got here is through using specialists to get quick, critical outs.  &gt;But is this a selling point? Has anyone ever come back from a World Series game and had this exchange:  &gt;Hey, you got to go to a World Series game? That’s amazing!  &gt;Yes, and I saw 12 pitchers! TWELVE PITCHERS! How cool is that?    &gt;None of this makes a difference to whine about right now. Even though I’ve already shown my alarming clout in the MLB—you saw the Dodgers ditched their garbage sweatshirts for handsome jackets for Game 1; maybe it had to do with the autumn cold, but I’m going to delude myself they read my column—baseball isn’t going to make a change in the next week. I’m not going to re-propose the “Catch-Up Rule” from those NYC academics—I’m still navel-deep in hate mail on that one, thanks very much.  &gt;We need to focus on achievable goals, and this means: napping.  &gt;I’m on record as being throughly pro-nap. I promote them, I take them, I likely even cause them, A few of you probably dozed off five paragraphs ago.  &gt;There are all kinds of cognitive motivations to nap: Your brain gets a rest, you awake energized and alert, you’re less likely to fall asleep at dinner with those dullard clients.  &gt;I’m just trying to help you stay awake for the World Series. Honestly, I’m not really worried about you missing NBA games right now. Nobody needs to watch the NBA in October; its like Christmas shopping in March.  &gt;For your baseball naps, it helps if you’re a bona fide Red Sox or Dodgers fan. Gives your naps more legitimacy. I recommend full transparency. Put your head down on a table and get a solid 45. Tell the bosses you need to get ready to watch sports on television. The boss will understand. If the boss doesn’t understand, sorry. My bad!   &gt;Maybe you are the boss. Set an example. Fall asleep. Don’t worry about missing anything. Everyone’s talking about you behind your back, anyway.  &gt;Trust me, this is all going to help. If you want to be really sure you can make it all the way through nine innings, pour yourself a handsome double espresso right about 9 p.m. ET. You may now be up until 5 a.m.—but at least you didn’t fall asleep during baseball.  &gt;If you don’t want to listen to me, listen to the Red Sox: They’ve got a nap room inside Fenway Park. Even they can’t stay up all night for baseball without catching some pre-game Zzzzzs. This is not a joke: the Red Sox themselves aren’t reading this column because they are ALREADY TAKING NAPS!  &gt;Now this is usually the time I hear from folks on the West Coast, especially Dodger fans, who are bored of this insufferable East Coast media bias. After all, it isn’t like people in Boston are the only ones impacted by the schedule. Dodger fans on West Coast time have to deal with games that are moved up to the rush hour. They barely have time to get home from work.  &gt;They’re tired of how their world is supposed to revolve around the sleep patterns of pasty, self-absorbed East Coasters.  &gt;Oh, boo-hoo-hoo, West Coasters. Nobody cares. You have beautiful weather, ocean and mountains and it’s really easy for you to get to Hawaii. You went surfing this morning and you’re going skiing on Saturday and you might stop for pinot at that adorable winery on the way home. Your Instagram photos are always beautiful and you’re fit and look like you’re going to live forever. Plus you can go out to dinner after the World Series games end. And now you have LeBron James.  &gt;I hate you, West Coast.  &gt;(I’m OK with Central Time Zone people—it’s a reasonable one hour, no big deal. Mountain Time Zone—I don’t know what that is. It sounds illegal.)  &gt;Please indulge us terrible East Coast snobs on this one. We’re a little cranky. There’s another long night of baseball ahead—and honestly, we need a nap.    Just google the title. I think they penalize paywalls.    But fuck night games. I went to bed after 11 and it was still in the seventh inning. Games are long as shit."
"Did you just claim Skip Bayless is up LeBron’s ass???? Really?? He HATES LeBron with a PASSION. That’s the only reason I cited him, because if he’s willing to admit that then it must be egregious  But anyway, last year LeBron was 14th in the league in FTA. Of the 13 players above him, only 2 take more shots in the paint than he does. That’s a discrepancy, but it gets worse.  LeBron is 18th when it comes to FTA after attempting a shot within 6 feet of the rim, only 7.4% of the time does he go to the line. Here’s some players who have a higher % than that: Eric Gordon, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Jeramy Grant, Bradley Beal, Caris LeVert, Nikola Jokic, Lauri Markkanen, Dwight Howard, and others. "
"They also have Lebron James. Its like betting against the Spurs. Im not a fan of how the pieces mesh but there is conventional talent there with Hart, Kuzma, and Ingram. I will stand by a Lebron led team making the playoffs until I am proven wrong.   I can see them having a players only meeting or firing Walton and then go on a run in typical LBJ fashion "
"50 wins is crappy? LeBron James willed that team to so many wins. That was an all-time season and it was given to Harden who had the narrative working for him with a ridiculous team.

I do think coaching does play a big role but the biggest factor to winning a title is having a top 10 player, it's nearly impossible to win without one. Basketball is the sport that's dominated most by its most talented and skilled players (a top player in the basketball matters more than the top football, soccer, hockey, and baseball players). We finally got one and this is the only time we've been a credible title contender. "

"&gt; Not only do you love attacking people personally by saying things like ignorant and pointing out reading comprehension, but wow, nah, I won't bother stooping down to your level. Lol.  Stooping to my level?  I called your *logic* ignorant and *asked* if you lacked reading comprehension.  Quit acting like somebody is attacking you personally and stop trying to victimize yourself.  &gt;The thing here is many players do flop, but one thing you are missing here is that HARDEN FLOPS WAY MORE. Not only does he flop in defense or something, he also loves FLOPPING TO DRAW SHOOTING FOULS.  Where is your proof that he flops way more?  Does the NBA provide stats for that?  Does some independent agency?  Are you looking at his FT numbers and ignoring the fact that many, and maybe even most of his FTs are legitimate (you can flop and be legitimately fouled you know)?  So he flops to draw fouls, where is your proof he does it more than every other player in the league or are you going by the Youtube videos and reddit comments you previously mentioned?  Lol  &gt;You admit that he is a flopper. What you can't admit is that he is like god flopper or at least one of the saints of flopping AND OF COURSE IT DEFINES HIM.  Again, where is your proof of this?  What quantifies this label other than your obvious bias?  &gt;He is still a really good player though as I mentioned because I do watch his games and I would definitely love to have someone like him on my team, but boy, if he is not, he really is a shitty flopper a lot of times.  Great, at least you admit that he is a great player.  I'll give you that because half of the people blasting him act like they wouldn't take him on their team and they are all full of shit.  I feel similar dislike about Draymond Green but I would love him on the Rockets.  He's a shitty flopper sometimes, I'll give you that too but unfortunately it is prevalent in the NBA and the most recent even (Embid last night) is evidence of that.  &gt;Now, I don't give a shit what I replied to or not, HARDEN IS A FLOPPER AND HE IS ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST AT IT AND ALSO BECAUSE THE REFS ALLOW IT.   For the third time, I'll ask for proof or wha backs this statement up?  Youtube videos?  If so, I can go and find multiple LeBron James flopping compilations and he is in conversations about being the GOAT.  I can find reddit comments echoing those.  The problem isn't Harden it is the refs and the NBA who have allowed those actions to fester in the league without taking initiatives to really change it.  Every player, from the greats, to the bench, to the newbies does this shit.  Some do it more than others but it is a problem everywhere, not with one player.  &gt;And no, I can see him objectively. He is really good at picking spots left or right (really deadly offensive wise), great ball handling (no comparison to Kyrie though), good shooter, great free throw shooter, abysmal defense, a freaking ton of flopping, and drawing stupid shooting fouls.  It's great that you can admit that but there is no reason to compare his skills to Kyrie and before you say I did the same thing with Green and LeBron above, please look again because that is not what I did."
"&gt;LeBron James missed 2 FTs with 12 secs left in OT and the Lakers up 1. In the final 15 seconds of the 4th qtr/OT, LeBron is 10-21 (48%) on FTs in one-score games since the start of last season. That's the worst FT pct of any player with at least 10 FTA in those situations.  He wasn't intentionally missing.  You Lebron stans will literally do anything to rationalize Lebron's failures in the clutch. I'm not willing to change my mind because you haven't been able to remove your mouth from Lebron's asshole long enough to produce any evidence suggesting otherwise."
"Lakers meeting with Bryant was ""intense"" and at one point Rajon Rondo was crying, but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned.  Later, at practice, Michael Beasley yelled, “There you go!” Lance Stephenson blew in Lonzo Ball's ear and whispered to him: “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Shawn Bradley hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"

"Ok, but that Spurs team is depleted of so many players right now, Houston isn't playing very well to start the season, and you guys have LeBron James. "
LeBron James is the only person in the history of the NBA to use PEDs. 
yep nothing odd about this. lebron james was definitely not created in a lab.
"So you can't say LeBron is clearly a better rebounder. All up a shorter guy playing on the perimeter only gets one less board - a defensive board - per game, suggesting that all things being equal the shorter guys might be better. In any case, one isn't clearly better than the other.  Jordan has  a DPOY, he's 3rd all time in steals (50% more than Lebron), 3 times steals leader vs 0, 18 all defence teams vs 11 (9 First team vs 5) and they get about the same number of blocks - again despite the size difference and one guy playing a lot closer to the ring. It's not close on defence; Jordan is elite, James isn't. Jordan does not get enough credit on the defensive end, he was literally one of the best all time for his position, and would make a lot of top 10 lists of all time best defenders. James is very, very good, but he's not in the best of all time defenders conversation. "
"Thing is though, NBAPA doesn't just fight to increase the overall share of NBA revenue that players get. It also works out -- and this is probably where the player reps have the biggest role -- how that money is distributed to the players. There are a lot of rules that have been put in place over the years that are meant to cause the NBA's middle class to make more money than it would ""naturally"". Take away cap exceptions and the maximum individual salary, and the NBA's middle class, who make up the majority of the players' union, would be making a lot less money while superstars would be making a lot more.  The owners would probably prefer fewer of these rules exist, so the NBAPA effectively uses some of its chips at the negotiating table to push for these changes.   Well, one change that raised my eyebrows in the 2016 collective bargaining agreement (in which very few changes were made) is that the ""over 36 rule"" was changed to the ""over 38 rule"". What this rule does is prevent teams from giving 4 or 5 year deals to players who will be over 36 before that contract expires. You can still technically give these players those contracts, but for cap purposes, the salary in the years after age 36 gets distributed evenly between the age 36 and younger years, putting a lower cap on the annual salary of players who want 4 or 5 year deals that extend beyond age 36.  The change puts that threshold at age 38 instead of 36 and was specifically set to benefit just a handful of players, including NBAPA president Chris Paul and NBAPA VP Lebron James.  So point is, Chris Paul's interests at that negotiating table don't necessarily align with the majority of the NBAPA's interests, so if you think he's selfish, it would probably be a bad idea to vote for him."

[LeBron James jokes that he and Chris Paul are 'not friends anymore'](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2018/10/23/lebron-james-chris-paul-were-not-friends-anymore/)
Solid point. But the playbook for defending LeBron James is basically to make him take threes. Even if he's creating a lot of his own three pointers he generally has a lot of space to do so. Kobe used to routinely jack up threes with guys in his jersey. I never remember anyone giving him space and daring him to shoot. 
"So in your clip there's a total of two people who said Kobe was up there with Jordan (David Stern had a financial incentive to say it and Mark Jackson was still saying foolishly that he would eventually go down as the best). There were people saying he was good, but not better and a few clips where we don't even know the context. There were people talking about only him and Jordan making certain shots, but that's not who's better. It's funny how supposedly he was already just as good if not better than Jordan and yet somehow he wouldn't even make most top-5 lists at this point even though LeBron is the only new addition.  You keep mistaking people saying that one day he might possibly, if everything goes right for many more years, be better than Jordan with people saying he actually was. I can say Ben Simmons might possibly eventually be better than Jordan, but to say he is would be a joke just like it was when people said it about Kobe who in the end never really got that close. [Some people](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/02/09/michael-jordan-lebron-james-stephen-curry-nba-greatest) don't even have Kobe in [the top-10. ](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/ranking-the-25-greatest-players-in-nba-history-100716).  Once again, you are confusing the concept of ""he might eventually have a chance to get into the conversation if everything goes right"" with ""he's already in the conversation now."" Well unless it's the part of the conversation where it's made clear that he was not there yet.   Let me ask you, if he was already right up there with Jordan halfway through his career, what did he do to in the end not really even be close? What part of his career was actually so negative that it went from 1a and 1b to Kobe not even being top-5? The reason is that nothing happened because he was never 1b and because any of the conversation was about what he might eventually become, not what he actually was."

"&gt; So Korver is absolutely ""deadly"" from the 3-point line.   I did not say he is not. I was asking for him to be compared to other shooters. Thank you for making a strawman argument and defeating it so soundly. I agree Korver is a good three point shooter. I am glad we are in agreement.    Regardless, I guess we just have a different premise of belief here. I am of the opinion that great shooters will be given a green light (James Harden) even if they are of relatively average efficiency because of their ability to create offense when there is none.  The same way you value being able to get open so someone can pass you a shot for an open look, the same way I value being able to create your own three point shot. Another great example is Kemba Walker -- I would argue Kemba Walker is a better shooter than LeBron James. Walker is a 36% three point shooter.   Out of a percentage of total attempted shots, Kemba takes 35% of his shots as 3 pointers. This is compared to LeBron taking 21% for his career. Kemba takes tougher shots and a higher percentage of his game is due to shooting; many times creating his own shot. Most people would argue he's a good shot and reason for it would be that he is both allowed to take tough shots when his offense needs it and makes the open ones when he's rarely left free. LeBron is not guarded at the three point line like Kobe is for multiple reasons in my opinion, nor does anyone recommend that for LeBron to win a game his strategy should be to look for a three point shot off the dribble. There are reasons for that. If you truly believe that Kobe is a bad shooter due to bad shot selection, I would consider that poor logic. Making tough shots should add to one's prowess, even if it is inefficient for someone to pursue that shot (and maybe they are doing it and it is bad basketball, maybe they do it because it is the best the team has -- I do not believe that is relevant to the discussion).   &gt;Very few players are better off forcing contested threes than driving or passing -- Kobe is no exception   Once again, I thank you for discussing who the better or smarter player is. Another great strawman defeated soundly. I will again agree with you on this. It makes sense that the better basketball play may be to drive and kick like LeBron James repeatedly does. It makes sense that in most cases the tough shot might be worse than running a Spurs-type of play and getting a clean open look for your dead eye Kyle Korver wannabe marksman. Once again though, we are not discussing what the better play is and I do not believe personally that it should factor into whether a player is a worse or better shooter.    "

One LeBron James? Now the Western conference is collectively tag-teaming LeBron and doing what he did to the Raptors. 
"And a player who makes $30 mil. a year can easily get that coach fired. That's authority. Fans don't pay to watch coaches coach, or officials officiate. In the end, it's a business and the players are the talent. Everyone else involved is just support staff.   Now, I know that there are still owners, GMs and coaches who haven't accepted this reality. However, I think you can tell which ones have; they're the ones that can attract and keep the top-tier talent. It ain't a HS team, where you don't get to play if you can't keep your grades up.

"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again   We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Yea well when people suck you off like you're the GOAT and so called king you better expect to get shit on when you pull some average player bullshit.   If you're Kyle Kuzma I give you a pass, if you're Lebron James, you bet your ass you're gonna get some shit. "
"As visible, the only two exceptions were the 2010 Rose MVP and the 2015 Curry MVP. And other than the 2017 Westbrook MVP, those have been the most controversial MVPs, and interestingly enough, many thought LeBron should be MVP over Rose in 2010, and again Harden over Curry in 2015.  ***  Games with 30+ Game Scores since 2010  1. 94 - LeBron James   2. 89 - James Harden  3. 75 - Kevin Durant  4. 71 - Stephen Curry  5. 66 - Russell Westbrook  6. 59 - Anthony Davis  7. 32 - DeMarcus Cousins  8. 32  - Chris Paul  9. 30 - Kevin Love  10. 28 - LaMarcus Aldridge  6 other players with 20+  18 players with between 10 and 19  ***  This year, LaMarcus Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, and Trae Young all have one such game  "

#HERE'S TEN TIMES LEBRON JAMES HAS MISSED A CLUTCH FT IN THE PAST 2 YEARS
&gt;Kyle Korver is a great shooter but will not get off the 3 point attempts a player like James Harden gets off.  Kobe Bryant is a great shooter but will not get off the 3 point attempts a player like Lebron James gets off.
"Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, only the ESPN stats department has access to the data that would allow for a career analysis of his FT shooting in the waning seconds of close games.  However, his relatively poor FT shooting is not some new discovery. If you're interested in a deeper dive into LeBron's struggles at the line with more context provided, there have been multiple pieces written about it by good NBA writers ([here's](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/presents19409872/fifteen-feet-trouble) one from Haberstroh, [here's another](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/17/17362892/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-technical-free-throws) from O'Shaughnessy at the Ringer)"
"Don't worry, they won't.

He also wants a cut of Hollywood.  https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/18010868/friday-the-13th-reboot-lebron-james-production
TIL LeBron James is a little guy.
"That's because he was LeBron-approved. Originally, James wanted Mark Jackson, but Gilbert told him to fuck himself so the two of them settled on Lue as a compromise candidate."
Lebron James
I love Lebron James and will always be thankful for what he has done for both the Cavs and the NBA...but I'll be damned if this didn't bring just a tiny smile to my face.
"Guys it was one game.  This is LeBron James we’re talking about.  He will be fine, this kind of thing just happens sometimes.  "
"So if player A makes 1000 3 pointers in my career by taking smart, responsible and high-percentage shots, and hit them at 35%, while player B makes 1000 3 pointers by taking 360 no-scopes, fade-away 3 pointers while being triple teamed, and launches it from the logo, at 30%, we should credit player B for being the better 3pt shooter because he doesn't know how to get open and take good shots? Steph Curry attracts twice as much attention as Kobe Bryant on the perimeter, and he takes 1/10th as many stupid fadeaways into the crowd with 5 players jumping on him.  I don't think taking stupid shots makes Kobe a better 3pt shooter than Bowen. Its about volume. Bowen took 2082 three-point shots in his career, while Kobe took 5546. That's why Kobe is obviously a better 3pt shooter than Bowen.   That's the main part. The thing is, LeBron is actually a bigger volume 3pt shooter than Kobe. James has taken 4720 shots so far in his first 15 seasons. Kobe Bryant took 4472 in his first 15 seasons (Kobe took slightly more than LeBron in his last 15 seasons). So, they shoot an equal amount of 3s, but LeBron has a noticeably higher 3pt% than him.  I'm all for saying Kobe is a better shooter overall (no doubt about that), but LeBron is the better 3pt shooter statistically. The point is about putting the ball in the basket. It doesn't matter if you do a cart-wheel, back-flip, 360 fade-away, or learn how to properly use screens and your own gravity to get open. Whoever gets the job done  is the better 3pt shooter, its not LeBron's fault Kobe was a showman and liked to get the crowd into it. Kobe could have learned to get open like Curry does (or LeBron) and probably shot the ball closer to 40%. But he chose circus shots instead. That should hurt his value, not improve it."
"Again, it's a 21-shot sample. That's minuscule for someone with the career volume of LeBron James. All this means is he's missed five shots more than someone would expect in this very specific scenario. It ignores every facet of the game that led to this scenario.  I don't think this has happened in this span, but a player could purposely miss a free throw because his team is down two with 2 seconds left, and getting a rebound would be more beneficial than making the free throw to go down one. Missing that on purpose is the best play for the team, but according to this stat, it would count as a miss.  Again, I can't remember LeBron being in that spot in last year's regular season, but that's how limited this stat is. "
"&gt; It’s still rampant, and James Harden is the most blatant and repeated offender.   I love him, but LeBron would be called for an offensive foul every time he drives. If refs wouldn't give him the Shaq treatment, it would be fine, but doing this would just make a huge part of his game far less effective."
IN MY OPINION!  Based off of pure talent:  1. Kevin Durant 2. Lebron James 3. Steph Curry 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis A.  Based off talent BUT including Legacy:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. James Harden   
"By the way, here.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/10/23/18013682/kobe-bryant-lebron-james-stats-free-throws"
"Yeah, if the pick that ended up as the Pistons’ at #2 and been the first overall, it would’ve stayed the Grizz’s draft pick (the Pistons got the pick because of trade in like ‘97 involving Otis Thorpe that I don’t feel like looking up). The ‘04 Grizz won 50 games that season and their first playoff bid with a just entering his prime Pau Gasol and army of wings like Mike Miller, Shane Battier, and James Posey. If LeBron gets drafted on to that team with Jerry West heading up the front office, there’s a good chance the league looks a lot different."
"If he's 15-21 he's close to his career average, and if he's 5-21 then he's historically terrible. You can't cite a small sample size and then decide to only read positives into the noisiness of the data.  And yes, LeBron has a long track record of shooting poorly in the final seconds of games, so I'm inclined to believe those numbers reflect reality. From 2016: https://twitter.com/espnstatsinfo/status/703425374294769664?lang=en  &gt; LeBron James is 5-47 on game-tying/go-ahead shots in final 5 seconds in last 10 years. Only Jamal Crawford is worse"
"https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1054609235806507009  &gt; LeBron James missed 2 FTs with 12 secs left in OT and the Lakers up 1. In the final 15 seconds of the 4th qtr/OT, LeBron is 10-21 (48%) on FTs in one-score games since the start of last season. That's the worst FT pct of any player with at least 10 FTA in those situations."
"If you're just now getting into basketball, you may as well watch some Lakers games to soak up as much LeBron James' career as you can. He's obviously gonna be the next MJ/Kobe in terms of people reflecting back on the time they played and wished they had caught more of it."
"Russell's accomplishments were questioned even in his own day because he did not care about stats -- and also because many of his most amazing stats simply were not collected in his era.  There was a raging debate about who was better, Chamberlain or Russell.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did not end that debate because first he compiled stats with few championships in the 1970s, then he compiled championships with lesser stats in the 1980s.  When Michael Jordan led the Bulls' dynasty he had the stats and the championships and the awards all at the same time.  He was even a superior defender.  He had everything, and no one could find a reason to knock him off his pedestal.  Interestingly, now that people are looking for a way to put LeBron James at or above Michael Jordan's level, they are reexamining the arguments for other contenders as well.  That especially includes Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, because his argument is similar to James' argument, especially if James keeps going until he is 40.  That argument is based on a respectable number of awards and championships, plus an accumulation of *career* stats that exceeds Jordan's.  The counter to that is that the most important stat is being the best player on a championship team as many times as possible.  But if that's the case for Jordan, why not for Russell?  Again, it's mostly because he did not have the stats, the same reason a lot of people argued that Chamberlain was a better individual player even when both were still playing.  (By the way, I argue for Russell over Chamberlain, but I can't deny that there was and still is a debate and no one today is likely to have seen them both play live.)  So for Jordan fans the GOAT is someone who combines all the qualifications -- stats, championships, awards -- all at the same time over many years.  Only Jordan fits that definition.  For James fans it's probably going to come down to *career* stats plus awards and championships, because only his career stats will clearly exceed Jordan's, and eventually will exceed Abdul-Jabbar's, if he avoids major injuries."
"Let's wait and see what happens. But if the Lakers don't end up doing significantly better than last year, it will be hard to try to sell anyone on Lebron being the best.  I know I'd rather have James Harden on my team than Lebron any day. "

No. That medical knowledge/equipment argument is bullcrap. Players today are as weak and injury prone as ever. Only one player in this pussy league play every night and that's Lebron James. Kobe was the same. And Jordan was the same. The real goats are special like that it has nothing to do with medical science bs.

not sure if anyone wants to do a write up of this but lebron aka king james essentially established feudalism in the cavs organization. 
"Before​ the Cavaliers​ exposed themselves,​ one​ more ‘gain,​ as a flawed, broken and​ uninspiring​ outfit,​ owner Dan Gilbert made​​ a rare visit to the locker room to remind his players of the purpose of professional sports. Hoping to uplift a team that was returning home after a humiliating road trip, Gilbert showed the Cavs the gaudy, diamond encrusted championship ring that his least favorite player, LeBron James, delivered to a long-suffering, title-deprived and passionate community.  Gilbert told the players that if they could bring an NBA championship to the Land, “It would be twice as big.” Ohio is a basketball hotbed, feeding the league superstar talent from LeBron James to Steph Curry, and Gilbert estimated that if the Cavs’ championship parade — the first the town had hosted in any sport in 52 years — drew nearly 750,000 to revel in the celebration, the Cavaliers would double the size of that crowd.  As he headed out of the locker room, Gilber whipped out the monstrous ring once again, like a proud kid at show-and-tell. When someone noted how heavy it was, Gilbert joked, “It should be, it has 215 diamonds.” Gilbert then grabbed his courtside seat and realized that no encouraging words, no displays of bling, could turn the team general manager Koby Altman constructed, Larry Drew has been assigned to coach, and Kyle Korver and JR Smith have been asked to leave, into a respectable contender. The franchise’s 2-year championship drought will be delayed for a while longer."

Guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Richard Jefferson hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Kinda, but at the same time his camp started the rumors, and we did the smart thing and waited to see if he was for real or not instead of selling the farm, and IMO it worked out since apparently he fucking loves Westbrook, and we got to keep our yutes and get LeBron James anyways.

Lebron has never had a major injury.   Everything aside about his career. This is the single most impressive thing.    By the end of this season he should be in 15/14 all time range.   "
"LeBron James, there are so many ways his story can still go.   Also surprised that Golden State isn’t talked about as a 30 for 30. An undisputed dynasty and super team that, at some moments, hardly seems pressured or tested.  Definitely think a 30 for 30 down the line on the Paul George - Oladipo trade could be very interesting. George demands a trade because he wants to compete ends up in OKC, Oladipo after being bounced around the league lands in Indiana and becomes an instant home town hero to the point he gets to drive the pace car at the Indy 500 and embodies Hoosier Hysteria in a way that George never could.

"If the person you had running point is large then you could theoretically play him with 4 large wings and bigs who could theoretically make a better defensive unit than it would be if the same player running point was somewhere around 5'10""-6'5""ish playing with the same other wings and bigs.  That being said, there are a shit ton more people in the world who are 5'10-6'5"" than there are who are 6'6""+, consequently there are a shit ton more players who are elite playmakers and/or shooters who are point guard sized. And you can't have too many skilled playmakers and shooters on the court, just like you can't have too many good defenders.   While being short is not an advantage in basketball, and while guys like Simmons, LeBron and Giannis can be the lone point on a good/elite offense if you could create the dream lineup with one of those guys you would include a Steph Curry, James Harden, Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard as one of their 4 teammates, then two large elite wings and an elite big over one point forward, three large elite wings and a big or whatever other combination. This would be due to you being able to make bigger gains on offense with one of these elite points than you could make on defense playing a lineup where everyone is large and athletic.  And in the real world where you can't just have anyone you could ever want, meaning you aren't going to have an elite player with point guard skills who is 6'8""+ and several other elite wings, having a guy like Ben Simmons can allow you to enjoy all the benefits of having a guy like JJ Redick without as many drawbacks as you would have with where JJ had to play next to an average sized point."
[Faigen] LeBron James ~~says JaVale McGee is a ‘Defensive Player of the Year candidate’~~ has lost his damn mind
"There are no goal posts man. This dude has like 55k career minutes. If anyone else not name LeBron was doing what he's doing and put up the numbers he did in the last 8 finals everyone would be praising him. Look at the defensive effort of anyone with that kind of mileage. Vince Carter, Dirk, Pau Gasol, Joe Johnson are all people with similar mileage. Don't see any of them getting DPOY awards anytime soon.   And before you say yea, but they're not LeBron James. I know, that's the point. "
I just said it gets them in rhythm. Lebron James rebounding a ball and dribbling at you full speed is far scarier than Lebron catching it on the wing and letting the defense see him back.  Same with Westbrook. There is some game plan to that. 
Derrick Rose - The way back  The shaq-kobe relationship  Spurs Dynasty  The Lakers-Hornets trade that didnt happen  Lebron James - for the land (championship run)  Kobe Bryant - Mamba Day (final game)  The best game ever played (team usa practice game - we know there's footage out there!)  The 2nd best game ever played (jimmy butler and his 3rd stringers)
Every other star player in the league including James Harden plays better defense than LeBron James 
"That Drtg ranks bottom ten in the league. The Lakers are a bad defensive team with LeBron on the floor, and the worst with him off the floor. Says more about his replacements than James."
"I didn't say that it was his only option lol I'm only going off your comment   &gt;no one offered him anything because they thought he was actually going to listen to his options    How could he listen to offers if they weren't made   &gt;he announced the gsw thing on july 3rd, well before all the teams had settled their free agency plans   Why should he wait for other teams to settle their plans? [Especially if they already refused to give him the same offer as the Warriors](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/07/03/demarcus-cousins-lakers-warriors-lebron-james)"
"dude, you know what having no qualms about something means?   imo his finals appearances isnt as amazing as his losing record is amazing, and thats what keeps him out of my personal top 3 all time.   If he was 9-0 in the finals, he would be #1 no questions asked. even if Lebron James had ANY of the following finals records   8-1, 7-2, 6-3, 5-4   he would be in the conversation for #1 all time. his finals record is way too glaring when put into context for me. thats why, again, personally, i have him outside my top 3 all time. You’re in the top 3, you find yourself in the finals? find a way to get it done.   being number 4 doesnt mean i dont recognize how great and dominant a player he is. But given how great and dominant of a player I know him to be, I expected more from him  Like cmon. if you’re #1 or #2 all time, and youre on the biggest stage, dont get swept. even AI could get you 1 against the Top 2 playoff team of all time"
"James Johnson. Giannis never plays well against us I think, same for LeBron and that's mainly because of James Johnson."

LeBron James vs Kyle Singler  Me and my friends were having a discussion on which player we would build a team around. What do you guys think? Who’s better?  
LeBron James signs in a few years to ruin all spacing.
"&gt; Him and Trump or much more alike than they think.   Lol not every person who likes publicity is similar to Donald Trump. This is one of the dumbest takes I’ve ever heard.   In fact, confusing Donald Trump with LeBron James, even if you are a hater, is one of the worst edgelord takes I’ve ever heard. "
The same reason that James Harden won over Lebron James last season.
"I think reasonable people would have to reconsider some of the LeBron talking points that have become pervasive in basketball conversations. Such as: 1. Does the consecutive finals streak mean as much when he doesn’t even make the playoffs when playing in the west? 2. Does He actually makes players “better”. 3. Do we need to reconsider how we rank players who have played in the west for the majority of their careers and lack team accomplishments (Chris Paul, James Harden, Westbrook,).  For me it would be a knock on him but wouldn’t knock him down from his all time ranking. "
"&gt;Don't let you're trust for Woj's news-breaking tweets clout your judgment when it comes to his editorialized articles, like the one he put out today on Magic and Luke.  I don't see anything negative about LeBron in this article at all. He's pointing out that LeBron tends to clash with coaches - something we know for a fact is true. LeBron *did* ask Riley to fire Spo and take over as a coach, Riley has confirmed that himself. LeBron was definitely the reason by Blatt was fired.   Nothing emotional about those stances.  &gt;Here’s the question: Who has the guts to tell him that he sounds like an immature, self-absorbed brat? Here’s the problem for the Cavaliers and James: No one.  I think this is also perfectly fair criticism, and I suggest that this age, LeBron would agree. Only having yes-men around you isn't healthy, and LeBron has mostly had that since high school.  &gt;Everything has come too easy to him, and he still doesn’t believe that winning championships takes a consuming, obsessive desire that borders on the maniacal. He is chasing high school and college kids on recruiting trips for his fledgling marketing company, medicating his insecurities with unending and unfolding free-agent dramas.  &gt;Stop strutting, stop preening, stop stomping away as an ungracious winner, a sore loser, and win something, LeBron.  Again, largely all reasonable and true criticism of him.  &gt;It was his time. His moment. He passed the ball away, saying later that he believed it would come back to him. He never should've risked it.  Hardly unique to Woj, pretty much *everyone* in the media criticized LeBron for making that pass.  &gt;And, still, LeBron's instincts weren't to take ball and deliver it down Bryant's throat. Score on Kobe, win the game and tell him to go to hell. Bryant would respect that.  &gt;So would Michael Jordan. Magic Johnson. Larry Bird. LeBron James is different. He's probably better than all of them, but nothing in his DNA demanded that he go after Bryant there, that he destroy him in that moment.  So, Woj is pretty much calling LeBron the GOAT here, and you take that as him hating him? LeBron doesn't have the ""mamba mentality"", he never has and he never will. Is that a fault? Maybe, maybe not. But it's not incorrect to call it out.  &gt;James missed his free throws, missed five of his six shots in the fourth quarter and overtime.  What franchise player wouldn't be criticized for going 1-6 in clutch time?  &gt;Woj isn't just mean when it comes to LeBron... he's usually wrong  Literally everyone was wrong about him going to Miami.   &gt;Woj is great at breaking news. But remember to take his articles with a grain of salt.  I don't disagree with any of that, but absolutely everyone in sports media is wrong on a regular basis (even the Lord and Savior Zach Lowe), and none of the quotes you've put out here indicates to me that Woj has any personal issue with LeBron."
&gt; The LeBron James
"Who cares if he was? You asked if he can be critical of lebron and be a good reporter st the same time. Yes he can, but this is a topic about LeBron James. In that situation, he absolutely cannot be biased and a good reporter on the topic. "
"not really:  &gt;"" in 21 games with a similar group of players, they played at an anemic 18-win pace (-8.9 SRS) before injuries ravaged their lineup. LeBron’s not worth 40 wins on a typical club, but no player in history has correlated more strongly with such massive, worst-to-first impact.[7](http://www.backpicks.com/2018/04/05/backpicks-goat-3-lebron-james/#easy-footnote-bottom-7)  It's undeniable lebron provided more lift.

2018 Finals Game 1  [Windhorst] LeBron James just grabbed the clipboard from Ty Lue during the timeout &amp; went to the bench to discuss a play with his teammates. JR Smith leaned in to add his thoughts.
Reading the other post in this subreddit about Woj's history with LeBron really changed my confidence in this article.    Magic probably did meet with the coaching staff but the article seemed a bit extra with him calling James out of shape and clashing with coaches etc. Felt like a negative piece smoothed out with editing to make it seem balanced.
"Unfair to group Stein in with Shams and Woj. Woj and Shams' jobs depend on access, and thus it compromises their integrity, while Stein is just a solid reporter. This excerpt from a [Kevin Draper piece from 2014](https://newrepublic.com/article/120572/adrian-wojnarowski-how-basketballs-reporting-machine-gets-his-scoops) captures it well:  &gt; Like Wojnarowski, ESPN’s Marc Stein—his biggest competitor—develops trusted relationships with sources that allow him to break a tremendous amount of news. The biggest difference between the two lies in Wojnarowski’s ability as a reporter-cum-columnist to impact league and public perception of the people involved. Stein’s archive consists almost entirely of news pieces. Because he so infrequently mixes reporting and opinion—in fact, a common criticism of Stein (and ESPN more generally) is that his work is stilted by so many words being spent on the boring work of detailing what information was learned when and from which anonymous source—Stein cannot promote an executive like Dumars or criticize a player like LeBron James quite the way Wojnarowski can."
"Not true. That's just a reddit narrative.  &gt;Miami Heat President Pat Riley on Thursday denied there was any attempt by LeBron James to seek the dismissal of coach Erik Spoelstra during James' four-season tenure with the franchise.  &gt;""Nothing like that ever transpired, nothing,"" Riley told the Sun Sentinel before addressing a media group at the Diplomat Resort &amp; Spa, where he received the Joe DiMaggio American Icon Award from the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital Foundation.

Lebron James
"It'll be interesting to see how Carlisle handles this stuff. It's pretty obvious by now that some guys on the Mavericks roster aren't cool with Luka taking the spotlight.  Reminds me of that time the Cavs players got really butthurt when asked about the possibility of Lebron James being drafted saying something along the lines of ""I don't think a teenager can come in and make a difference""."

god forbid he doesn’t worship any and everything lebron james! how dare he! fuck him right?
Being snarky; I was watching. But are you seriously suggesting that this WoJ stuff is so dangerous that we may have never seen Lebron James become what he is today? Give the best player in the world a little more credit than that.
"DeMar ""LeBron Stomper"" DeRozan hot on the heels of Lebron ""The Enigma"" James."
Lonzo Ball just grabbed the clipboard from Luke Walton during the timeout &amp; went to the bench to discuss a play with his teammates. LeBron James leaned in to add his thoughts.
"Woj can eat a dick. LeBron pulled off the greatest upset in NBA Finals history.  King James has his faults - but he seems to be a dedicated player, a good person and a professional."
So Luke Walton is going to quit his dream job coaching the Lakers and Lebron James because Magic was mean to him?  Have you ever had a boss?
"The Williams Sisters are as close to a LeBron James female equivalent in their sport. bigger, faster, stronger, smarter and highly skilled than their opposition.  And they got destroyed by what would be the NBA equivalent of Jimmer Fredette... if Jimmer was drinking and smoking during time outs."
"If Lakers can make it into the playoffs... it probably is going to be a really fun season.  IMO LeBron can carry the Lakers team into the second or third round in the west playoffs just with this roster if they figure out a decent 4th quarter closeout rotation. As well in the playoffs, LeBron for the last 2 years can carry about 30% of the entire teams productivity from points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks \[1\] (stats below on 2018 Cavs playoffs run).   Regardless of what experimentation goes on in the regular season, i.e Luke figuring out rotations, Magic trading personnel, LeBron building chemistry... LeBron will show up for showtime in the playoffs. He has a fucking insane track record of doing so (8 years in a row). I agree though, the drama of getting to the playoffs (even at 8 seed)... is probably the biggest regular season question within the current lakers organization.     |James 2018 Playoffs|Total|Percent of team total| |:-|:-|:-| |Points|725|34%| |Rebounds|193|22%| |Assists|190|47%| |Steals|30|24%| |Blocks|22|24%|  \[1\] [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/08/sports/basketball/lebron-nba-finals.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/08/sports/basketball/lebron-nba-finals.html)"

"Which goes back to my original point.  ""If Carmelo wanted him on the team, he would have been.""   So Carmelo didn't want him on the team.   You act like the owner is the only one who makes the decision, when Dan Gilbert/LeBron James hated each other and yet Gilbert did whatever LeBron (the star player) wanted contract wise.  That was Carmelo's role in New York. "
"someone like, say, Lebron James?"
"We'll have to check the L2M report tomorrow but in [2016](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-golden-state-warriors-christmas-technical-foul-hanging-rim-richard-jefferson-trip-last-two-minute-122816) when he did it they said it was a missed call.

Yet when asked about the play Wednesday, LeBron claimed that the initial no-call was the right decision from the officials because the play was already over."
As much as I wanted him to get a tech that would have been BS to be honest. It is LeBron James in the last 15 seconds
Following a put back dunk LeBron James Sr. proceeded to suspend himself from the rim of the basketball hoop for approximately 10-15 full seconds after the Atlanta Hawks notified the referee’s that they as a team would like to use one of their time outs
Apparently he did the same in 2016 after a timeout was called and the NBA L2M report said it was a missed call: https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-golden-state-warriors-christmas-technical-foul-hanging-rim-richard-jefferson-trip-last-two-minute-122816
Because its Lebron James.
I think they changed the rule so that if you are LeBron James and if you pull off a dunk after missing two free throws at the end of the game you can just chill there. 
James Jones really did LeBron a fucking solid.

That's what happens when you build a team around lebron james and he leaves afterwards 
"Plus/Minus is a deeply flawed stat. It's way more reliant on other players than one single player. A player that does nothing could have a positive plus/minus just by sharing the floor with certain players.  LeBron James was -22 in a game he played earlier this year where he almost had a triple-double. That's just one of the many reasons why I don't look at plus/minus with any sort of validity.  What I DO know is that this team slows to a crawl anytime Rondo is on the floor. I also know that adding Rondo to the floor creates another negative on defense, which the Lakers can ill afford with Kuzma being a traffic cone and LeBron being disengaged at times. And another thing I know is that Rondo pounds the ball into the floor on every possession, hunting assists like he always has instead of keeping the ball moving around quickly.  If ever there were an empty stats kingdom, Rajon Rondo would be the king."
"To be fair to Tristan he was just basing that on past years performances, but forgot to account for a small variable called HAVING LEBRON JAMES ON YOUR TEAM. "
"TBH I reckon it's Lebron's fault. Every time when the bench are in, they extend the lead and play with enthusiasm. When Lebron comes in with a lead, he does his random shit like his sky hooks or step back threes recently. He doesn't look like he gives a shit and then opposing teams start creeping back. I guess you can do that when you're Lebron James "

"On a very fundamental level, you are of course right. However, like all the other comments here point out, it is too little and too late. This is a defeatist argument, and it could be applied to anyone ever trying to do anything to make a change, but I definitely don't think the NBA will lead the charge in cutting back on our collective carbon footprint. But, again, you are right that they maybe should do more, as they are currently pushing the idea that athletes are more than ""just athletes"". You see the likes of Lebron James providing a leading voice in social issues, and climate change is intrinsically linked to issues of social justice, as it will affect the world's poor much more severely than the global middle/upper class.

"If you're talking about assholes like Butler and Bryant, fuck them.

Something doesn't compute in his case. We'll figure it out eventually."
He hasn’t played a full seasons worth of games yet and now has to play with LeBron James. You of all people should know how that works. Take off that Lakers flair it’s embarrassing to have y’all former Cavs fans speak for us all over this sub.
"Well, that's going better than expected. I guess LeBron James CAN lead teams to the winning side.  Let's look at Cavaliers now. Ouch :("
Cavs with LeBron James III
"Yeah that Spurs fan just made things up. He didn't cite any evidence although he sounded sure and that's basically in a nutshell what the Kawhi as a great Lebron defender narrative comes from.   For instance, he says:   &gt;Game 4  &gt;Lebron had 9 points in first half and the Heat were blown out by 19 at halftime. He padded his stats from there, and he did not score on Leonard in the first half.  A simple youtube search shows that's a lie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHildNORBpY&amp;t=2m33s  &gt;Game 5  &gt;Lebron had 1 FG in 2nd quarter (2:30 mark) to bring the Heat within 5. Then he did not score again until the Heat were down 21 with 4:40 in the 3rd.   This is true. Lebron scored 3 points in the 2nd quarter with 1 FG and 1 FT. However, it just completely omits that James had *17 points in the 1st quarter.* It's crazy how this narrative of Lebron scoring all his points in garbage time is just created through glaring omission.  Like even the ESPN article many people like this user cites doesn't actually prove Leonard contained Lebron.  &gt;Kawhi Leonard has been the primary defender against LeBron James in the NBA Finals.On the surface, it appears that LeBron James has not struggled against Kawhi Leonard. Video tracking shows that James shot 12-of-18 (66.7 percent) with Leonard as his primary defender in the first three games of the 2014 NBA Finals.  http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91407/kawhi-leonard-wreaking-havoc-on-lebron  But if you just read the title you would think otherwise. It's a weird conspiracy. Another ESPN article with the stats for the entire series:  &gt;Leonard's defense on James in the series was key. James shot 57.6 percent against him, but he wasn’t always able to get his shot off or even get the ball.  http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91529/mvp-leonard-does-it-all  I get the point that Kawhi did a lot to deny the ball to Lebron, but so do other defenders I don't get why only Kawhi gets credit for this. Even Lance Stephenson will do this and he will go extra hard. This year on one play off-ball he literally held Lebron's hands. Lebron and Lance then both look at the ref for a foul, then Lebron rips his hands away and goes to get the ball. This is great ball denial and off-ball defense by Lance too, but it did not change Lebron's production."
Just look at LeBron and Zubac's +/- over the 12 games.  Looks like Zubac has a better grip on the game than LeBron James then.
"He's a hypocrite. In his interview with Rachel he talked about how he always gives full effort and always wants to win. How he ""loves the game of basketball"".   And what'd he do? Half-ass it on the court. Wave his towel with Warriors fans to mock his team's loss. Guard fucking LeBron James with a hand down his pants.  He deserves the hate, for those reasons and more."
Being LeBron James seriously helps.
"Look at the context of his era. I’ll show the FGA/G and TS% for the top option of each team from the 2003-04 season as an example:  ATL: Stephen Jackson (15.8, 52.1%)  BOS: Paul Pierce (18.7, 51.7%)  NJN: Jason Kidd (14.3, 48.5%)  CHI: Jamal Crawford (16.5, 48.6%)  CLE: LeBron James (18.9, 48.8%)  DAL: Dirk Nowitzki (17.0, 56.1%)  DEN: Carmelo Anthony (17.9, 50.9%)  DET: Richard Hamilton (14.9, 52.2%)  GSW: Jason Richardson (16.5, 50.4%)  HOU: Steve Francis (14.1, 50.1%)  IND: Jermaine O’Neal (17.9, 48.9%)  LAC: Quentin Richardson (16.4, 48.4%)  LAL: Kobe Bryant (18.1, 55.1%)  MEM: Pau Gasol (13.4, 54.2%)  MIA: Eddie Jones (14.3, 53.8%)  MIL: Michael Redd (17.5, 54.4%)  MIN: Kevin Garnett (19.6, 54.7%)  NOLA: Baron Davis (20.9, 49.2%)  NYK: Stephon Marbury (17.1, 51.9%)  SEA: Ray Allen (18.2, 56.6%)  ORL: Tracy McGrady (23.4, 52.6%)  PHI: Allen Iverson (23.4, 47.8%)  PHX: Shawn Marion (17.0, 51.3%)  POR: Zach Randolph (16.9, 52.8%)  SAC: Chris Webber (18.3, 45.6%)  SAS: Tim Duncan (17.1, 53.4%)  TOR: Vince Carter (20.0, 50.1%)  UTA: Matt Harpring (13.2, 52.4%)  WAS: Gilbert Arenas (16.6, 51.2%)  As you can see, only Dirk and Ray Allen had a higher TS%. And this was a season where Kobe wasn’t even at his best either. He had a season where he averaged 32 PPG on 58 TS% which would be elite even today. Kobe being inefficient is a huge myth. He could definitely average 30 PPG on 60 TS% in today’s game which is considered MVP-caliber as you can tell from last season."
Reminded me of [this](https://pics.me.me/complex-com-plex-pxmag-lebron-james-jr-wont-wear-his-36562096.png) which always makes me laugh lol
"Which is kinda stupid considering (iirc) his stated reason was the expectations on his son. He doesn't have the expectations because of ""Lebron"" being his first name, he is gonna have the expectations because ""James"" is his last name."
"The amount of leadership that exists in the NBA is astounding and I put a lot (most, maybe) on LeBron James. This is not the days of MJ and those guys who didn’t take hard stances. This is a league that openly expresses really great values and it really started with LeBron, who showed these guys how to be a man in the public sphere. Yes, Iverson probably had an equally large impact socially but I’m not sure he was the best role model. LeBron, since he was 16, has shown more class than most adults I know and see on TV.  I’m not saying I agree with all their political statements, personally, but I can’t deny the positive impact these guys are having on today’s youth, especially young minority children. And you can this leadership being passed on to great young men like Curry and others."

"In my opinion: I firmly believe if it would have existed last year, OPOTY would have went to James Harden giving LeBron the MVP. Too many times reporters are conflicted because they want to give recognition to a guy that has a good scoring year but the only way to do that is MVP in the current system."
"And there is none of this ""well the whole team changed after he left"" shit like some people are saying about why the Cavs post 2010 were bad. No. It's because LeBron James isn't with them anymore. He makes shit look amazing. "
"Yeah , they will turn it around,  James harden is too good a player to not reach atleast 45 to 50 wins with a decent roster built around him.  They remind of the cavs from last year , IT had trouble guarding everyone and Crowder was unhappy playing the 4 alongside lebron. They started slow as well , they were 5~7 and lebron had to go into playoff mode for them to win any games. They went on a win streak which was ruined when IT came back and they had to get rid of him and rose who was not a 100 percent.   Like you said cutting down Melo's minutes and finding another 3 and D wing should fix their issues , James Ennis isn't helping them much either. "
Oladipo was bad because he was the 1st option and so the Cavs targeted him. He is carrying his team now again better than Love could ever dream of.  Lebron is the most efficient deep 3 shooter in the game he has been for a while now: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-james-is-the-new-steph-curry/  He is also the most efficient player at game winning field goals all time. He simply makes shots.  &gt;A center that thinks hes steph curry. My god the dude takes like 5 3s a game at 33%.  So? In his prime he shot 40%. Just last year he shot 36% on 5 attempts.  In the playoffs he has shot 40% or better 3 times.   He doesn't think he's Steph Curry he just has an all-around game despite the stereotypes people like you try to force on him. 
We’ve had the strongest schedule in the league so far but sure.   Enjoy being the only team to sign LeBron James and get 0 rings out of it lmao
Imagine if LeBron James Junior becomes a substitute teacher.
"You have Lebron James. The Lakers will be under more scrutiny than any team in the league while he’s there and dominant. He’ll, *Cleveland* was one of the two most talked about teams in the league when Lebron was there. If he can do that to the Cavs it’s crazy how much attention the Lakers will get."
"Im saying in our meme culture and with the current state of disparaging older players as being lesser than players from this era, it is very likely that people will remember Bron as being a better Laker than James fucking Worthy.  I understand using the nickname ""Big Game James"" for LeBron is a joke for some, but there are a lot of kids/casual fans who wont know the difference (and thus won't go out and research just how great of a PF Worthy was. To me he's one of the best to ever play the position when you consider his college career and his longevity in the NBA)."
Lebron James. 
"In 25 years, I'll be the old grand pa who keeps telling my grand kids Warriors dynasty beats Lebron dynasty. Until Lebron James Jr. Wins 10 titles in NBA"
Lebron-James Jones-Chandler Lakers
Yeah lmao I know Lebrkn is chilling bit more this year but we're talking about lebron motherfucjing James vs the Kings lol it was always going to be a washout

The burden of having LeBron James
Lebron James is a Laker what the fuck
Gotta reward winning. His team has a better record then YOUR Los Angeles Lakers with LeBron James. 
It's not like he uses the same number as his dad so I don't think it's a problem  https://www.complex.com/sports/2015/12/lebron-james-jr-refuses-wear-dads-jersey-number
LeBron James has played 1154 regular season games and counting for his career and he has averaged 27-7-7.  Remarkably however he has never actually completed a game where his stat line concluded with 27-7-7 exactly. So it's kind of a meme on here and were waiting for the day he actually does it.
Imagine Lebron James Jr. Dude even has his dad’s name.

On the flip side there may be minutes where Justin Jackson guards Lebron James rip
"In fact less than a quarter of all MVP award winners were able to also clinch the Finals MVP award in the same season. Seven players did it one time while LeBron James (‘11-12; ‘12-13) and Larry Bird (‘83-84; ‘85-86) achieved this feat on two separate occasions. Michael Jordan, fittingly, capped off four of his MVP seasons with Finals MVP hardware."
"Yeah okay, and LeBron hasn't proven he can win without James Jones."
Kyrie averaged 30 on 55-45-90 in the last 5 games of the 2016 finals then averaged 29 in 2017. You seem to be a LeBron James fan so what do you have to say about lebron letting kd pull up for an UNCONTESTED 3 in his face in the last minute of a crucial game 3? Or letting iggy strip him on the lay play with the game on the line? I guess lebrons basketball iq didn’t hurt there huh? But kyrie averaging 25 in the entire playoffs as a second option hurt? Fuck that no wonder he left your ungrateful asses
"But imagine this. If Brooklyn Nets didn't trade like 50 picks to Celtics, and the 2016 pick ended up being a bit higher.  Right now they could've had a starting lineup of:  * PG: Ben Simmons - 2016 draft * SG: James Harden - Acquired via trade (Nets sent 2018 2nd round pick, and an old school Drazen Petrovic jersey) * SF: Caris LeVert * PF: LeBron James - FA signing * C: Prime Shaq - I dunno... a miracle  I could see them making the Eastern conference semis at least!"
"Do you think Jimmy would have wanted to go to Philly if he knew LeBron was there? Sure, Philly could have traded for him anyway but do they if Jimmy makes it clear to them he’s not interested in playing with LeBron? There is no way to know for sure, but there is enough talk about Jimmy not wanting to go to LA with James that it seems like something to consider"

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"The good old Lebron James. Same monster physique robs you of some calls, but what can you do. "
"LeBron James is king of posting misleading stats so his fans can be like “b-b-b-but he led both teams in points, rebounds, assists, and steals”  LeBron has a higher floor than curry and kd but curry and kd have higher ceilings. Meaning Bron could take a team from 35 wins to 51 wins but Steph and kd could take a team from 51 wins to 60. They fit into offenses easier and kd especially is better on defense. Lebron plays consistently in a system that requires him to do everything. Score, rebound, assist. Yet for anyone actually watching, his impact on the team isn’t as impactful as the others "
I'd personally take Siakam over Lebron James/MJ in their primes. 
There’s a difference between saying LEBRON JAMES and CARIS LAVERT wins mvp
How is that an excuse? He's talking about the reasons why the series was close. Is Lebron James' incredible talent an excuse for why the Cavs made it to the Finals last year? Or is that just why they made it to the Finals? I can read just fine I'm just confused why you think of it as an excuse

[WOJ] Breaking News: LeBron James retires after game 1 of 2019  NBA Finals
"it does matter. cause its gonna cripple the 76ers by the time they could compete.   &gt;I really like RoCo and Saric. But implying that they were going to be great five years out is just as big a leap as saying Butler will be bad five years from now.   don't put words in my mouth. i never said RoCo or saric were gonna be as good as butler is TODAY in 5 years. if they are, good for them. if they aren't, they were gonna be cheaper than a 34 year old Butler making 35 million. thats my point. butler is not gonna be good because nobody other than LeBron James is good at that age. like you're fighting father time and biology here. its a scientific fact that males leave their physical prime at 28-29 years old. like literal fact. LeBron is a super exception to the rule.   &gt;maximize their chances of winning now   they went from .0000000001% to .00001%. by sacrificing their future cap situation. thats why this trade is super retarded.

I'll take the Covington half. C is close to D which he's really good at. Now if we could get the Lakers to send either LeBron or James to us we could really make a run.
With that logic Lebron James should just be handed mvp every season.
He's LeBron James' fucking son. Does it really matter where he plays? He will have every D1 scholarship possible thrown at him. 
"LeBron James misses a shot on a foul at the rim, grabs the Ball, looks at him and speaks to him, “You mother f*****. I hate you!” Then he kissed the Ball."
"The ball gets Lebron James off the inbound, gave him look of pleasant surprise and speaks to him, ""We got an [expletive] squad now"" Then, stated ""Y’all look so different.”"
"Fun fact : LeBron James had twice as many playoff 40 point games last year as all Sacramento Kings players in franchise history combined.  Of course, all of those were Oscar Robertson, before the franchise was called Kings, and wasn't in Sacramento."
"Well find me another player that has more win shares/higher +/-, and higher replacement value than Jokic in the last 2 seasons. You can’t.....

Can't believe Lebron James had an opportunity to play with this guy and he turned downed him and Simmons. He would've had a legit chance at winning 3 more rings before he retired.
"As the three sailed through the air, a dramatic voice from above says ""shall this be the season that one man will take over the reign of Lebron James as the best player in the league?"". The three swooshed and that voice responded with ""yes""."
"If you really don't see the clear star potential in Tatum after everything he did last season then I really don't know what to tell you. He led the Celtics against Giannis, Simmons, Embiid, and *Lebron James*. A person as young as him has no right to have a game so polished. "

"You mistake activity with achievement.  Nobody says the Cavs didn't try. Nobody accuses Gilbert of being cheap. Just of being meddling and incompetent and letting his ego dictate his moves.  First of all, the Cavs weren't able to land a decent coach in 7 years. Not one.  Second, they kept throwing shit at the wall hoping it sticks. And made moves that were obviously stupid, like giving Larry Hughes a max deal after 1 single good season which happened to be a contract year. You had to be beyond stupid and not have watched the NBA at all to not be aware of the contract year phenomenon. It was the era of players having 1 good season followed by a big deal and sucking for the rest of their career: Dampier, Olowokandi, Jerome James and others.  And it's not like there weren't good UFAs on the market. 2003 Arenas, 2004 Nash - both signed for around 10 mil/season, much under their real value. 2004 Camby, Horry. 2005 Redd - a shooter like Redd next to Lebron ? Fucking hell.   And I could keep going. There were available SMART moves. The Cavs somehow kept making dumb moves."

"If Lebron wanted Kyrie traded then he would have been traded for Paul George end of discussion. The fact that the Cavs traded him to the Celtics tells you who was making that trade because the Cavs were going for that pick from Boston to secure their future believing Lebron was gone; whereas Lebron was in win now mode and wanted Kyrie.  &gt;not sure where you’re getting your info from.  Tons of sources, but even Lebron James straight up said so on national tv he didn't want Kyrie traded and Rachel Nichols confirmed that.  Where are you getting YOUR sources from? Youtube comments? Because your version is youtube/reddit comment tier.  Ask yourself this, why was Kyrie mad at the Cavs organization? Why was he at one point refusing to take calls from them? It's because he was mad they disrespected him they included him in trade talks in my opinion it's obvious.  Here's the Melo source: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2735700-carmelo-anthony-cavaliers-trade-including-paul-george-was-axed-on-draft-night  There's tons of stuff out there you can piece together what happened."

Underrated one is James Harden because he kind of looks a little off.  Like hes actually got a screw loose.  Doesnt seem rehearsed like say Westbrook or Lebron
"This quote got me:  “But we went ahead and made the trade, opening the door for Chicago to sign LeBron James and/or Chris Bosh, pairing them with Joakim Noah and Derrick Rose, and immediately becoming the most unstoppable team in basketball. Hey, but we got Kirk Hinrich!”  Man that free agent period was insane. "
"Keep in mind KD joined the defending champions when he was 28.  lol you're acting like KD is upgrading. 31 year old KD joining a 34 year old Lebron James sounds great but would have been fun 5 years ago.  LA is playing a dangerous game waiting by the way. If you don't get KD, you just wasted another year of Lebron's fading prime."
"Stop putting words in my mouth.  I never said that their relationship had no bearing on the trade, just that it wasn't the most important factor.  Relationships can be a main factor if its somebody on the end of the bench for minimum money like Jack Haley w Rodman or even James Jones towards the end of his career w LeBron, but with rotation guys its only part of the equation.  I would say that if Patty Mills were Kawhi's buddy then Toronto still would've wanted Green because they wouldn't be locked in with him 2021 like Mills.  "

Don't be sleeping on Lebron James Jr.
what if this is a purposeful leak by Lebron James camp to avoid any criticism of Lebron for something coming out soon
"I'm not the only one with this sentiment. I'm not saying LeBron James isn't one of the greatest to ever play, I'm saying the system that is run on teams he leads is flawed.  Why do you think they always _want_ to stick him with elite off the catch shooters? LeBron doesn't play off ball, and he doesn't pass to you unless your wide open. He's never been able to beat teams with a high basketball IQ. Facts."
Yeah I realize that now. To quote a dude from /r/sports:  &gt;I'd sooner forget my own name than forget the handshake I had with LeBron James
"As a human, I'll let Lebron James get behind me."
Lebron James easy. Fuck the Lakers. I hope Lebron pulls a Steve Nash on that shit franchise and says his back hurts and not play. 
LeBron James 
Lebron James was also adamant with Cavaliers GM: give JR Smith a blank check. 
Way to downplay how insane a lebron james + KD would be 
" ""The play JR held the ball, LeBron was adamant on call with Cavs shooting guard not to forget the score. According to four sources, LeBron was then told score wouldn’t be forgotten. Then, 15 mins later, it was.. James, who was still wide open on the three point line, punched a whiteboard and slumped in his chair."" "
"Yes Lebron already owns AD unofficially, there’s a King James tattoo on AD’s lower back but he’s kept it covered up for this year "
"All the KD defenders miss the point completely, jesus. He joined a 73 win team when he joined the warriors. It was a top 5 team of all time, that 73 win team. When he joined, everyone said it's going to suck because they are going to steamroll through the playoffs while KD is on the team. They've played 1 series in 2 years that has been more than 5 games. Everyone complaining about it wasn't complaining that they were the best team, but that they were so good there was no drama around the games themselves. That was a valid criticism.  &amp;#x200B;  Playing with Lonzo Ball and a 35 year old LeBron James makes them probably the best team in the league, but not so good the league is uncompetitive. Jesus, this really isn't hard to grasp."

LeBron James 
"I'm calling him Lebron James, Sr., from now on."
"&gt; LeBron was always leaving, let's be real.  The link that you yourself posted disputes this. Here's the actual text (which I noticed you changed when you posted it as the headline above):  &gt;**James was adamant on the call — do not trade Irving**, especially to the Celtics. By the end of the call, according to four separate accounts of people present for the conversation, Altman told James the trade would not occur.  &gt; Minutes later, on Aug. 22, 2017, word broke that the Cavs agreed in principle to send Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and Brooklyn’s 2018 first-round pick.  &gt; James’ close friend, Randy Mims, and bodyguard Rob Brown came to him with their phones to show him the news. James, who was still signing jerseys, dropped the pen and slumped in his chair.  &gt; **“Everyone knows that when Kyrie got traded it was the beginning of the end for everything. It’s not a secret,” James said** in an interview with The Athletic.  &gt; James suggested he didn’t feel he was lied to by Altman, so much as Altman was overruled by owner Dan Gilbert."
"So you're saying Lebron tried to trade Kyrie? Chris Broussard is wrong, and Lebron James lied to Rachel Nichols on national tv before the finals saying he didn't want Irving traded?"
"Lebron James should not have to compromise in this situation.  Kyrie is the one with his head all in the clouds not thinking properly.  Kyrie has an ego that rivals MJ's and had he kept it in check, he could still be adding rings and trophies to his collection right now.  Instead, he's now attempting to be the #1 guy instead of taking the #2 role and being the Pippen to Bron's MJ.  Kyrie is a baby. "
"You say that, buuut:  &gt;As ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported on The Lowe Post, James is bothered the most by the team not trading for either Paul George or Eric Bledsoe (h/t Erik Garcia Gundersen of LeBron Wire).  &gt;George was traded from the Indiana Pacers to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the offseason, while Bledsoe was sent to the Milwaukee Bucks from the Phoenix Suns at the start of November.  &gt;Both players were on the trade block during the offseason, but the Cavaliers failed to acquire either player, even though they were offering Kyrie Irving in return.   &gt;Jackie MacMullan of ESPN reported there was a three-way deal in the works in June that would have sent both Bledsoe and George to Cleveland, with Irving and Channing Frye going to the Suns. Phoenix nixed the deal when it didn't want to send the No. 4 pick to the Pacers.  &gt;According to Windhorst and Ramona Shelburne, James also ""aggressively recruited"" George to come to Cleveland and stay there beyond his free agency in 2018.  It's worth pointing out that had this trade gone through Kyrie would be in Phoenix right now. The only reason it didn't was because LeBron refused to commit long term to Dan Gilbert so it was nixed. "
this new group of Laker fans is in no way ready for the amount of hatred that we will receive if we end up with Kevin Durant and LeBron James through free agency.  if Kevin Durant ends up being a somewhat major character in space jam 2 it will be even worse.   I can't fucking wait to see if this dumb shit actually happens. 
"With Kyrie on the Celtics and Lebron James out of the east, it feels like Danny Ainge really was playing 9D chess with the Cavs and completely and purposefully tanked the organization. "
"Ingram has been better this year than last year. Unless you aren't taking into account the fact that LeBron James and Rondo taking PG minutes away from him, as well as taking away his only Pick N Pop partner in Lopez.      If you're talking flat stats and not taking the context of the season into account, then Ingram has been marginally less productive in these 16 games than last season."
&gt; knowing damn well they could whiff on everyone.  Yeah because nobody would possibly want to play in LA for max money with Lebron James and a bunch of talented young players...  The Lakers whiffing on all the names out there in free agency next year would be one of the more shocking sports storylines in a long time.  
The reason that Kyrie demanded a trade to begin with was because he found out management was planning on trading him during the 2017 offseason. He knows that LeBron was aware of this and was all for it (provided it was for someone like PG) and that was the straw that broke the camel's back. Judging by the [shots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zn-z1lkbf0) [that]( https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/894754750956163077?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E894754750956163077&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Flarrybrownsports.com%2Fbasketball%2Flebron-james-subtweet-kyrie-irving-portland%2F386916) they were sending each other over the summer  I don't think Kyrie thought Lebron was doing it for him.
"Wait, the Cleveland Cavaliers are putting on a tribute for Miami Heat great Lebron James?!?!!"

"That guy is one of the more ridiculous commenters here in this sub. Here's the relevant part regarding this from [the original Athletic article](https://theathletic.com/660104/2018/11/19/lebron-james-cavaliers-trading-of-kyrie-irving-was-beginning-of-the-end-of-everything/) for anyone curious about what was actually reported today:  &gt;James was adamant on the call — do not trade Irving, especially to the Celtics. By the end of the call, according to four separate accounts of people present for the conversation, Altman told James the trade would not occur.  &gt; Minutes later, on Aug. 22, 2017, word broke that the Cavs agreed in principle to send Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and Brooklyn’s 2018 first-round pick.  &gt;James suggested he didn’t feel he was lied to by Altman, so much as Altman was overruled by owner Dan Gilbert."
"He's getting paid like Lebron James, James Harden, Steph Curry, Westbrook (and what KD would be getting paid under ordinary circumstances). If you can't understand that he's nowhere on the same level as them, I don't know what to tell you."
"In [the original Athletic article that this all came from](https://theathletic.com/660104/2018/11/19/lebron-james-cavaliers-trading-of-kyrie-irving-was-beginning-of-the-end-of-everything/) they talked about how Griff was in the process of working on a Kyrie for Paul George deal when Dan Gilbert let him go. Gilbert then (probably) forced Altman in the direction of seeking out a future draft pick as the centerpiece of the trade (that Nets pick that became Sexton), rather than wanting to try to go all in right away, probably because he was worried LeBron would leave.   For me the real key piece from that article was this bit:  &gt;But after the Cavs won their first and only title in 2016 — the city’s first since 1964 — James did something that summer for which he receives little credit. He signed a multiyear contract, for two seasons with a player’s option for a third... And after Durant and the Warriors beat James and the Cavs in five games in the 2017 Finals, James, for the first time, headed into the summer without either freedom of movement or leverage over the organization.  &gt;So when Griffin, the general manager who’d built the Cavs’ 2016 championship team and whom James trusted, didn’t get a new contract from Gilbert when his old deal expired, there was nothing James could do about it. When Irving was traded, there was nothing he could do about it.  I think this is key because it shows that the minute LeBron ceded any control back to the Cavs, they totally fucked him by letting Griff go and trading away Kyrie for (mainly) a draft pick. Once LeBron saw all that, he says it was the beginning of the end for him in Cleveland, and who could blame him? He couldn't trust the organization to not cut corners or make stupid decisions unless he was holding his free agency over their head, and I think he clearly didn't want to keep doing that year after year for the rest of his career."
"&gt;Which owner in their right mind would Continue giving LeBron the reigns when he didn't give any assurance that he was going to be here for good.  Every single one. It's Lebron fucking James. Every year he's on your team your team is good. The Warriors just fined their own player to appease Kevin Durant.  &gt;If LeBron truly wanted to stay, he would have taken a 5 year deal instead of holding the Cavs to ransom by taking short deals every season.  He had to do that to force ownership to care about winning. That was Lebron's leverage. Otherwise, he would be stuck there with nothing just selling tickets for ownership like the first 7 years in Cleveland."
"Fuck that he's Lebron James. Cleveland needed him, he sure as hell didn't need Cleveland. The cavs org should've been grateful for every little breadcrumb one year contract they got from him."
"Not a joke at all.  [Regular season stats](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/1966/lebron-james)  [Playoff stats](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/1966/seasontype/3/lebron-james)  Athleticism isn't everything. ""Points per game"" isn't the only statistic that matters. His FG% has been going up later in his career as he becomes a better shooter, his rebounds and assists are up, he's a better leader, he has more poise in high-pressure situations, etc. Overall, he's a better basketball player now than he was 10 years ago.  If you disagree, tell me why."
"pretty sure that's why LeBron signed short term contracts, it was to yield power over the front office. He always has the upper-hand in what decisions are made as his bargaining-chip is threatening not to re-sign. As the article mentions, Koby asked LeBron if he would commit long-term for them not to trade Kyrie, which he wouldn't do.   I feel like LeBron already made up his mind to leave after last season, and he lost his bargaining chip with the front office, they operated regardless of what James thinks last season... Last season was the exception though, Cavs knew he was gonna leave, the seasons prior wasn't the case, and they had to appease LeBron in order to keep him coming back. "
Lebron James
Ikr who tf is this anybody LeBron James
Crabbe also wasn’t the #1 pick or the “next Lebron James” or “Maple Jordan” nor is his contract just kicking in 
"&gt;These Warriors teams have differed from each other significantly (as championship contenders).  Compared to difference between the Cavs in LeBron's last year there to the Heat in his first year there or compared to the Cavs last year and the Lakers this year?  &gt;But if you want something radically different, look to the latter half of the 2009-2010 season--Steph's rookie year under Don Nelson. That Steph played an awful lot like today's Steph, and he made D-League guys look like NBA players and he turned defenses upside-down. He's stronger now, and he's more consistent at beating the trap. But the numbers and skills and improvement of his teammates were all there.  So... won 29 games the year before. Played at a 26 win pace in the first half of the season you are telling me to look at. Played at a 26 win pace in the second half of the season you telling me to look at.  3 win downgrade year-to-year and no win change from first half to second half isn't really doing much to prove your point, right?  &gt;Keith Smart and Mark Jackson did everything in their power to keep Steph from doing what makes him so special in the NBA. Even Steve Kerr is hesitant to truly unleash Steph. But Don Nelson did it with a hapless Warriors roster and showed the world that a future MVP was playing in Oakland.  ...and still was on a 26 win pace. For comparison, Cavs went from 17 wins without James to 35 wins his rookie year.  I'm not saying that there is no case to be made as as far as Curry being a big help to his team, I'm just saying that the evidence you are pointing at isn't helping make the case that he does it as well as LeBron."

LeBron James has already played in his last NBA Finals
"Well I can’t speak for Lakers fans but for me I never pegged him to be a franchise player type but just a probably the 2nd or 3rd best player on a playoff team which I still think he can, but not with LeBron on his team, there’s a reason why you keep on hearing reports like Kyrie had to leave the Cavs, because he didn’t want to play with LeBron anymore or Kawhi not wanting to play 2nd fiddle to LeBron at the end of the day it would be wise for Ingram to get the hell out of LA because he will never live up to his potential if he’s stuck playing with LeBron James which isn’t all rainbows and sunshine if you really think about it"
"Soo you’re telling me if AD was available the Pelicans wouldn’t even think about taking Ingram, Kuzma, Hart, and picks for AD. I mean you act like Ingram is a complete utter scrub which he’s not, the problem is he’s just not the type of player that’s thriving playing with LeBron James, trust me if he gets traded to the Pelicans he will have drastically better numbers with the Pelicans "
"Twice? Shaq, Kareem, Wilt, Lebron. We’ve had 4 of the top 10 players of all time come to our team in free agency or requesting a trade, and also we got “lucky” and traded Charlotte for Kobe, “lucky” drafted James Worthy when we were already a championship team, could go on and on.  We have the best player in the world, playing for a 16x champion winning franchise, with Magic Johnson as president, and we’re also in LA.    "
"There is nuance with the Irving deal. When Irving demanded to be traded in July 2017, he did so in large part because he no longer wanted to play with James.  Irving, in fact, told the Cavs he wanted out so badly he’d go ahead with knee surgery and miss a large portion of the year if he wasn’t traded. James, who did little to try to bridge the divide with Irving, told the Cavs to keep Irving in spite of his threats.  Then there is Griffin, who before he parted ways with the organization knew Irving was unhappy and had already explored some ideas of his own to trade Irving — just not to the Celtics, and not for a deal in which the most valuable asset the Cavs were getting back was a draft pick for future use. Griffin’s idea was to leverage Irving’s desire for change as a way to acquire Paul George, another elite player who would have helped James try to win now. But he wasn’t going to do it without first getting a new deal from Gilbert, or without talking to Irving and agent Jeff Wechsler to make sure of Irving’s feelings.  None of that ever happened. Griffin and Gilbert never came to terms on a contract. Enter Altman, 34 at the time, promoted from his position as Griffin’s second assistant. By late July, Irving’s trade demand had become public, and the Cavs, believing the situation between Irving and James could not be fixed, began fielding offers, feeling Irving’s value was at its highest.  But as James noted, Irving was under contract for two more seasons in Cleveland, which made this trade demand different from the situations San Antonio and Minnesota would go through with players like Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler. Moreover, James, Lue and other players and coaches felt the uncertainty around Isaiah Thomas’ injured hip should have been a deal breaker. Once it wasn’t, from that moment forward, James felt Gilbert was taking a more active role in basketball decisions and was in effect trying to pivot away from an organizational structure centered on James.  Nearly everything after that was a struggle — the team’s new acquisitions never jelled and were eventually traded for other players who also sometimes wrestled to fit in. James played in every game, regular season and postseason. The playoffs brought two seven-game series, and James won two postseason games on buzzer-beaters. And when the Cavaliers improbably reached the Finals again, and James scored a playoff-career-high 51 points in Game 1, the Warriors took it to overtime on the heels of a few costly Cavs miscues, including JR Smith’s forgetting the score with the ball in his hands inside of five seconds left. Golden State won the series in a resounding sweep.  Once it was all over, James, once more a free agent, took a family trip to the Caribbean to consider his options. Believing the Warriors could not be toppled by what he had in Cleveland, especially with Irving gone and not replaced by anyone near his caliber, he chose where it would be most comfortable for his family to live and prosper while he finishes an illustrious career that is currently in year 16. He’ll be 34 in December.  Last week, James passed former Lakers great Wilt Chamberlain for fifth on the all-time scoring list, wearing a Lakers jersey, on a day when the temperature in Los Angeles reached 78 degrees.  James’ agent, Rich Paul, watched the game at Staples Center sitting next to Terence Nance, who will direct “Space Jam 2,” starring James. Arnold Schwarzenegger was there, as were Adam Sandler and Cindy Crawford and Nipsey Hussle and Flea and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Just a typical Wednesday in L.A.  James’ primary business interest, SpringHill Entertainment, is more successful than ever and headquartered in Hollywood. His eldest son, LeBron Jr., a budding pro prospect as an eighth-grader, can play against optimal competition out west.  “I felt this was my next step,” James said. “I don’t like to dwell on the past too much. People get sensitive when I talk, I don’t like ruffling people’s feathers and things of that nature. It was just meant for me, meant for my family going forward.”  James scored 44 the night he passed Chamberlain. Last night, he dropped 51 points against another of his former teams, the Miami Heat, in their building.  The Cavs, meanwhile, are in a total rebuild. They are 2-12, owners of the worst record in the NBA, and are heavily scouting college players and pros in Europe for the upcoming draft. Veterans left behind by James were rankled early this season when it was apparent the organization would not try to contend for the playoffs, even after being told by Altman it would.  James said as he returns to Cleveland this week, he’s looking forward to stopping by his I Promise Akron elementary school, and maybe visiting his suburban mansion with his mother (his wife and sons will spend Thanksgiving in Los Angeles). He also said he’s not expecting a reaction from Cavs fans anything like what he was met by in 2010, when he came back to Cleveland for the first time as a member of the Miami Heat.  “Shit, it better not be,” he said, referring to the flaming pile of hate and vitriol few had seen inside a pro sports arena.  Regardless, he’s prepared for whatever comes.  “It doesn’t matter if it’s negative, because the only thing that matters is what I gave to the city, what I gave to that community, what I’m still giving to that community,” James said. “It doesn’t matter. At the end of the day, they have one obligation and that’s to cheer for their team. And I’m not on the team.  “And personally I’m in a whole different space than I was in 2010, so shit doesn’t bother me.”"
"LOS ANGELES​ — The​ day the Cavaliers agreed to trade Kyrie​ Irving to the​ Boston​ Celtics,​​ LeBron James was signing jerseys for Upper Deck in Santa Monica, California.  When then-coach Tyronn Lue, also in California at the time, found out what was about to happen, he drove out to see James and put him on the phone with Cavs general manager Koby Altman.  James was adamant on the call — do not trade Irving, especially to the Celtics. By the end of the call, according to four separate accounts of people present for the conversation, Altman told James the trade would not occur.  Minutes later, on Aug. 22, 2017, word broke that the Cavs agreed in principle to send Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and Brooklyn’s 2018 first-round pick.  James’ close friend, Randy Mims, and bodyguard Rob Brown came to him with their phones to show him the news. James, who was still signing jerseys, dropped the pen and slumped in his chair.  “Everyone knows that when Kyrie got traded it was the beginning of the end for everything. It’s not a secret,” James said in an interview with The Athletic.  James suggested he didn’t feel he was lied to by Altman, so much as Altman was overruled by owner Dan Gilbert.  “You realize at that point in time, take nothing from Koby, because Koby (was just named GM), but at that point in time, you realize that Koby’s not the only one running the team, as (former GM David Griffin) had done, and that’s why Griff was let go pretty much,” James said.  Cavs front-office officials declined to be quoted for this story but disputed that Altman gave James any indication the trade would not occur. They also said Altman asked James whether he would commit to the Cavs long-term if Irving were not traded, and James said no.  On Wednesday, James will walk into Quicken Loans Arena as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers for his first game against the Cavs since leaving the organization a second time as a free agent.  “I’m returning to a place where I’ve spent 11 years of my career,” James said. “I had some great moments, had some not so great moments, but, all in all, when you give everything to whatever, the franchise, a teammate, a coaching staff, anything, that’s all that matters.”  It wasn’t supposed to be this way. When James made his triumphant return to Cleveland in 2014, after four years and two titles in Miami, he said more than once that he intended to retire there.  Then, the next four years happened: an astonishing mix of amazing, heartbreaking and truly bizarre. Not even LeBron expected he’d so quickly be able to bring Cleveland its first major pro sports title in more than 50 years, and certainly not in such dramatic fashion. Nor could he predict that the title, along with his philanthropic work in his hometown of Akron, would cement his legacy in Northeast Ohio regardless of where he finished his career. He had no idea Kevin Durant would stack the deck in Golden State, or that his own team would lose the general manager he trusted, then trade away the other elite player he depended on — at Irving’s demand, no less. Or that one of his closest teammates would unspool one of the greatest performances in NBA Finals history by forgetting the score of the game.  There has been some assumption that one of the biggest factors in LeBron leaving Cleveland was his strained relationship with Gilbert, a strain that is both well-documented and overblown. It wasn’t like they were close before James announced on TV in 2010 he was headed for South Beach, and Gilbert responded with the Comic Sans letter, nor had they become friends when James chose to return to Cleveland.  The distrust between them was always there. When they struck a new partnership in 2014, James stuck to his job of playing at a level to put the Cavs in the Finals, and Gilbert kept his word to spend the money necessary to keep the team competitive.  Initially, the organization bristled at James’ method of doing contracts — signing one-year deals instead of a long-term, maximum contract like the three guaranteed years he gave the Lakers in July. When James felt the roster needed upgrades in season, or if he felt a change was needed at head coach, he let it be known through his body language, his commentary and his play.  But after the Cavs won their first and only title in 2016 — the city’s first since 1964 — James did something that summer for which he receives little credit. He signed a multiyear contract, for two seasons with a player’s option for a third.  Yet that same summer, the balance of power in Cleveland’s boiling rivalry with the Warriors shifted for good as Durant, a former MVP, shocked the NBA by signing with Golden State. And after Durant and the Warriors beat James and the Cavs in five games in the 2017 Finals, James, for the first time, headed into the summer without either freedom of movement or leverage over the organization.  So when Griffin, the general manager who’d built the Cavs’ 2016 championship team and whom James trusted, didn’t get a new contract from Gilbert when his old deal expired, there was nothing James could do about it. When Irving was traded, there was nothing he could do about it."

"are you seriously saying LeBron didn't know why Kyrie wanted to leave? because that's objectively wrong. like, from the article:  &gt;James, who did little to try to bridge the divide with Irving, told the Cavs to keep Irving in spite of his threats.  LeBron (and Cleveland) knew the reasons he wanted to leave. you're making shit up now to defend LeBron."
"I see what you are saying but I disagree in sorts.  I think it was a bitch move by the reporter to ask Lebron that question, especially when Kyrie was sitting next to him.  Instead, I think he should have directly asked Kyrie that question.  How is your PG going to throw up nearly a couple dozen shots in a playoff game without any assists?  I would love if reporters skipped the wishy-washy ""how does it feel"" type questions and be direct; ""James, you had an other-worldly game on the offensive side of the ball.  You shot lights out from behind the 3-point line and finished the game with 40 points.  However, your team lost and you acted loafish on defense, per usual.  Why don't you ever play defense, James.  Why?"""

I'm not justifying anyone but that year was Steph's peak he did amazing things and til 3 - 1 lead they would have bring home another magnficient run. Only Lebron James' will and relentless could have done that comeback"
Lebron!!!!!  Motherfucking!!!!  James!!!!  **CASUAL &amp; GODLIKE**  
A team built around LeBron James is now doing bad because they're tanking. Wow great proof^/s
"Orrrrrr the 60-win 1 seed from 2015 that got 4-0ed by the Cavs in the ECF? Out of our 10 consecutive playoffs appearances, a good number of them ended at the hands of LeBron James."

"&gt;Irving, in fact, told the Cavs he wanted out so badly he’d go ahead with knee surgery and miss a large portion of the year if he wasn’t traded. James, who did little to try to bridge the divide with Irving, told the Cavs to keep Irving in spite of his threats.  This is really the crux of the entire situation, nobody really made an effort to salvage the relationship. The organisation decided that once he threatened to have knee surgery that he had to go at all costs and LeBron, despite needing Kyrie, never went out of his way to reach out to him."
"Part 3  There is nuance with the Irving deal. When Irving demanded to be traded in July 2017, he did so in large part because he no longer wanted to play with James.  Irving, in fact, told the Cavs he wanted out so badly he’d go ahead with knee surgery and miss a large portion of the year if he wasn’t traded. James, who did little to try to bridge the divide with Irving, told the Cavs to keep Irving in spite of his threats.  Then there is Griffin, who before he parted ways with the organization knew Irving was unhappy and had already explored some ideas of his own to trade Irving — just not to the Celtics, and not for a deal in which the most valuable asset the Cavs were getting back was a draft pick for future use. Griffin’s idea was to leverage Irving’s desire for change as a way to acquire Paul George, another elite player who would have helped James try to win now. But he wasn’t going to do it without first getting a new deal from Gilbert, or without talking to Irving and agent Jeff Wechsler to make sure of Irving’s feelings.  None of that ever happened. Griffin and Gilbert never came to terms on a contract. Enter Altman, 34 at the time, promoted from his position as Griffin’s second assistant. By late July, Irving’s trade demand had become public, and the Cavs, believing the situation between Irving and James could not be fixed, began fielding offers, feeling Irving’s value was at its highest.  But as James noted, Irving was under contract for two more seasons in Cleveland, which made this trade demand different from the situations San Antonio and Minnesota would go through with players like Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler. Moreover, James, Lue and other players and coaches felt the uncertainty around Isaiah Thomas’ injured hip should have been a deal breaker. Once it wasn’t, from that moment forward, James felt Gilbert was taking a more active role in basketball decisions and was in effect trying to pivot away from an organizational structure centered on James.  Nearly everything after that was a struggle — the team’s new acquisitions never jelled and were eventually traded for other players who also sometimes wrestled to fit in. James played in every game, regular season and postseason. The playoffs brought two seven-game series, and James won two postseason games on buzzer-beaters. And when the Cavaliers improbably reached the Finals again, and James scored a playoff-career-high 51 points in Game 1, the Warriors took it to overtime on the heels of a few costly Cavs miscues, including JR Smith’s forgetting the score with the ball in his hands inside of five seconds left. Golden State won the series in a resounding sweep.  Once it was all over, James, once more a free agent, took a family trip to the Caribbean to consider his options. Believing the Warriors could not be toppled by what he had in Cleveland, especially with Irving gone and not replaced by anyone near his caliber, he chose where it would be most comfortable for his family to live and prosper while he finishes an illustrious career that is currently in year 16. He’ll be 34 in December.  Last week, James passed former Lakers great Wilt Chamberlain for fifth on the all-time scoring list, wearing a Lakers jersey, on a day when the temperature in Los Angeles reached 78 degrees.   James’ agent, Rich Paul, watched the game at Staples Center sitting next to Terence Nance, who will direct “Space Jam 2,” starring James. Arnold Schwarzenegger was there, as were Adam Sandler and Cindy Crawford and Nipsey Hussle and Flea and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Just a typical Wednesday in L.A.  James’ primary business interest, SpringHill Entertainment, is more successful than ever and headquartered in Hollywood. His eldest son, LeBron Jr., a budding pro prospect as an eighth-grader, can play against optimal competition out west.  “I felt this was my next step,” James said. “I don’t like to dwell on the past too much. People get sensitive when I talk, I don’t like ruffling people’s feathers and things of that nature. It was just meant for me, meant for my family going forward.”  James scored 44 the night he passed Chamberlain. Last night, he dropped 51 points against another of his former teams, the Miami Heat, in their building.  The Cavs, meanwhile, are in a total rebuild. They are 2-12, owners of the worst record in the NBA, and are heavily scouting college players and pros in Europe for the upcoming draft. Veterans left behind by James were rankled early this season when it was apparent the organization would not try to contend for the playoffs, even after being told by Altman it would.  James said as he returns to Cleveland this week, he’s looking forward to stopping by his I Promise Akron elementary school, and maybe visiting his suburban mansion with his mother (his wife and sons will spend Thanksgiving in Los Angeles). He also said he’s not expecting a reaction from Cavs fans anything like what he was met by in 2010, when he came back to Cleveland for the first time as a member of the Miami Heat.  “Shit, it better not be,” he said, referring to the flaming pile of hate and vitriol few had seen inside a pro sports arena.  Regardless, he’s prepared for whatever comes.  “It doesn’t matter if it’s negative, because the only thing that matters is what I gave to the city, what I gave to that community, what I’m still giving to that community,” James said. “It doesn’t matter. At the end of the day, they have one obligation and that’s to cheer for their team. And I’m not on the team.  “And personally I’m in a whole different space than I was in 2010, so shit doesn’t bother me.”"
"Part 2:  It wasn’t supposed to be this way. When James made his triumphant return to Cleveland in 2014, after four years and two titles in Miami, he said more than once that he intended to retire there.  Then, the next four years happened: an astonishing mix of amazing, heartbreaking and truly bizarre. Not even LeBron expected he’d so quickly be able to bring Cleveland its first major pro sports title in more than 50 years, and certainly not in such dramatic fashion. Nor could he predict that the title, along with his philanthropic work in his hometown of Akron, would cement his legacy in Northeast Ohio regardless of where he finished his career. He had no idea Kevin Durant would stack the deck in Golden State, or that his own team would lose the general manager he trusted, then trade away the other elite player he depended on — at Irving’s demand, no less. Or that one of his closest teammates would unspool one of the greatest performances in NBA Finals history by forgetting the score of the game.  There has been some assumption that one of the biggest factors in LeBron leaving Cleveland was his strained relationship with Gilbert, a strain that is both well-documented and overblown. It wasn’t like they were close before James announced on TV in 2010 he was headed for South Beach, and Gilbert responded with the Comic Sans letter, nor had they become friends when James chose to return to Cleveland.  The distrust between them was always there. When they struck a new partnership in 2014, James stuck to his job of playing at a level to put the Cavs in the Finals, and Gilbert kept his word to spend the money necessary to keep the team competitive.  Initially, the organization bristled at James’ method of doing contracts — signing one-year deals instead of a long-term, maximum contract like the three guaranteed years he gave the Lakers in July. When James felt the roster needed upgrades in season, or if he felt a change was needed at head coach, he let it be known through his body language, his commentary and his play.  But after the Cavs won their first and only title in 2016 — the city’s first since 1964 — James did something that summer for which he receives little credit. He signed a multiyear contract, for two seasons with a player’s option for a third.  Yet that same summer, the balance of power in Cleveland’s boiling rivalry with the Warriors shifted for good as Durant, a former MVP, shocked the NBA by signing with Golden State. And after Durant and the Warriors beat James and the Cavs in five games in the 2017 Finals, James, for the first time, headed into the summer without either freedom of movement or leverage over the organization.  So when Griffin, the general manager who’d built the Cavs’ 2016 championship team and whom James trusted, didn’t get a new contract from Gilbert when his old deal expired, there was nothing James could do about it. When Irving was traded, there was nothing he could do about it."
But you really didn’t watch him play. And those threads you posted are not even helping your cause lmao.  Since you didnt watch him last year and you’re opinion is based on 2 nephew posts. Here have a read  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2751497-if-you-thought-the-lakers-would-be-better-without-lonzo-ball-think-again  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/9/25/17896972/lonzo-ball-lebron-james-lakers  These are all based on his playmaking last year. 
Who’s this LeBron James fellow?
I say 2 more.. I can definitely see Russ lighting up the score board and my dark horse candidate is Lebron James. People are sleeping on Lebron going off because he has a young core of players who love to shoot the ball.
"Steph didn’t do that alone though, he was just a huge part of it. The backcourt of the warriors in general did that. And everything you just typed out still doesn’t paint the whole entire picture. Lebron James is still the face of the NBA. Regardless of how the game is played, he’s the most popular player still. When you combine that with him STILL being the best player in the league, I think it’s still lebrons."
LeBron James asking the rhetorical question about 15 on a roster spot. The man replayed a whole 2 minute play by play. 
Wall makes too much money for the caliber of player he is to be valuable to any team.  He should be the 3rd best player on a championship team and right now he has a contract of a LeBron James/Curry/Durant/Harden caliber player.   Talent wise I'm not sure Wall is better than Kemba Walker or Damian Lillard.
You can google this man. The reasons are listed all over the place. This link has 17 lol.  [https://thegruelingtruth.net/basketball/17-reasons-michael-jordan-greater-lebron-james/](https://thegruelingtruth.net/basketball/17-reasons-michael-jordan-greater-lebron-james/)  &amp;#x200B;
"He never said that to LeBron, I think. Also he eventually came around and said he saw why LeBron left and he isn't angry/blaming him for it.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23088267/pat-riley-said-lebron-james-did-right-thing-left-miami-nba  ""After LeBron won his championship for Cleveland, he told ESPN's Dave McMenamin: ""When I decided to leave Miami -- I'm not going to name any names, I can't do that -- but there were some people that I trusted and built relationships with in those four years [who] told me I was making the biggest mistake of my career. And that s--- hurt me. And I know it was an emotional time that they told me that because I was leaving. They just told me it was the biggest mistake I was making in my career. And that right there was my motivation.""  'It wasn't me,"" Riley told Thomsen. 'I never said anything to him.'"" "
"Of course he does. Who the fuck is urgently doubling Kyrie Irving with LeBron James on the court. LeBron is the engine for the offense. Likewise Curry is the engine for the Warriors offense. Everyone plays off of him, and he is by *far* their most impactful offensive player. This bears out statistically and with your eyes if functioning.   Yeah Klay sure is playing like a top 3 shooter all time rn. That top ten scorer all time was getting wide open dunks in transition in the NBA fuckin Finals because defenders were scared to leave Curry. Kyrie doesn't have to worry about getting aggressively trapped 26 feet away from the basket like Steph."
And is still hard doubled behind the three point line. What does that tell you.  Kyrie faced majorly single coverage against the Warriors in both finals...because they had to worry about LeBron fuckin James. Kevin fuckin Durant got lots of single coverage in the Finals thanks to Steph.
Curry. I only wonder what his elim stats would be if he played with LeBron fuckin James.

Lebron James „with no regard for human life“.
I HATE LEBRON JAMES 🤬🤬🤬
"Lol, I said ""as well as.""  And you should know as well as I do that no one can really stop guys like AD or Lebron but Dray does a damn good job of making the defensive plays when it counts.  You can't argue that, Dray is a clutch defender and when you need a stop he's usually the guy who makes the defensive play.  And while RHJ and Siakim might be that in the future, they aren't that right now so you cant say they're better than him.  And like you said, you know Dray does the little things that don't show up in the stat sheets so why are you so focused on the stats? Yeah they could put up similar numbers though only James Johnson could probably put up an actual line exactly like Dray (RHJ and Siakim realistically probably wont drop 7 dimes and both aren't as good of shot blockers as dray).  Even you said RHJ is a stretch right now, so AS OF NOW RHJ and Siakim cannot do Dray's job like you claim.  And Dray was strutting his stuff since year 1 before the Warriors were a juggernaut and was the defensive general before KD came and before Klay became a legit 2 way star.  Dray did way more than Siakim and RHJ in his first 3 years than they did (not numbers wise, but game wise) and that was before the Warriors got good.  Yes, Siakim and RHJ have the potential to do that and be better, but as of now, they aren't.  And James Johnson didnt ball out til he was 28, so yeah, lol.  He probably could be Draymond like with a lil less defense but took him way longer to prove it.  "
"Lol, you literally put his name in the hat for an overrated thread, how can you appreciate a guy and think he's overrated?  And no way in hell James Johnson, RHJ or Siakim can do Dray's job as well or better.  While all 3 players are good, they can't do everything that Dray does.  You think James Johnson RHJ and Siakim could guard star centers like AD and KAT AND forwards like Lebron AND guards like Harden and Lillard as well as Dray does?  And I know for a fact that none of them can quarterback a defense and play help D like Draymond.  They may be better at some things Dray does but they are not better then Dray as a complete package and they sure as hell aren't better at defending all 5 positions than Dray.  And where in the definition of All Star does it say a player must meet a certain stat threshold?  It doesn't.  Hell, I dont even think there is a concrete definition of ""All Star""  Yes you could argue Draymond shouldn't be an all star and other players are more deserving.  But don't disrespect Dray by saying dudes like RHJ, James Johnson and Siakim do his role better, cause they don't.  "

its almost like it takes more than a week for a team to adjust to losing lebron james.
"I mean he already reminded us that Cleveland is still the team to beat, this is just obvious stuff. The way TT was able to absolutely carry that load in Cleveland those last couple of years is incredible and with the lost of some valuable role players like Kyrie Irving and Lebron James, he’s gonna be even better 💯💯💯"
"It's just my opinion, but I think it can be decently substantiated. He is 23 and currently the leading MVP candidate for this season. The only MVP's aged 24 in the last 40 years are Michael Jordan and LeBron James. He is also the only all-star on a legit finals contender, which is insane for the modern NBA. This is all without a jumper, which I think he would need to develop to reach the ceiling I'm talking about.  Edit: also D Rose, my bad"
how was it BS. he punched lebron james in the groin on purpose. how is that not a flagrant foul?
"|We are talking about developing into being an average to below average shooter willing to take shots from 12-20 feet. That's all he needs to be to get respect and open up the defense. We're in a thread talking about ben developing a shot I'm gonna stop right there cause I have no interest in talking about ""ben developing a shot"", I only talked about him because of your flair to bring up the example how a gifted shooter like embiid can develop a some good shooting(especially from the line) relatively quickly.   Shooting is a gift elite or non-elite, like you said, you can practice a lot and improve but where you start and where you end up is all determined by talent.  Free-throws are such a big indicator how good their muscle memory is at recalling specific move. Guys like Klay,ray allen can not shoot a single free-throw all night and go the line and easily sink a pair. While someone like Lebron James, if he doesn't get a lot of touches and put up some shots to establish a rhythm,  he will struggle from the line.  But shooting is not just about freethrows, to hit the shots steph curry hits, the amount of coordination needed to stop on a dime and quickly release the ball is so rare.     |If you're telling me that is harder to do that to grow 3 inches, cut .5 seconds of your 40 time, or add 6 inches to your vertical then I can't help you. Now you are just putting words in my mouth. I said you can't practice being 3 inches taller just like you can't shoot 45% on 11 attempts from 3. Somehow you made the whole thing about ben simmons when you said: |If he was able to raise that to 38% on 5 attempts per game over then next 2 years it would completely change his game and our offense.  And in case you having noticed, I'm telling you again, explicitly , I'm not discussing about ben simmons, I'm just talking about shooting in general and how people overlook it as something everyone can learn but in reality how good of a shooter you can be is determined just like how tall you are."

"&gt; So does LeBron James.  Lebron probably lead the league in non foul calls for years. He got a ton of calls, but he also had an insane amount of non calls because of how strong he is. "
A team built specifically for LeBron James is doing poorly without LeBron James. Shocking news
"I don't agree, if big players play on the perimeter they draw fouls all the time.  Giannis Antetokounmpo and Anthony Davis draw tons of fouls.  So does LeBron James."
They gave him a max because LeBron brings big bucks to the Lakers. No player wants to play with LeBron and enjoy the drama show. Literally everyone left him. Kyrie got the fuck outta there because he didn’t want to play with LeBron. Kyrie literally threatened the Cavs to sit out just to escape LeBron James. This man is a team cancer.
"His role changed drastically from 2009-10 when he was the sole star to 2010-11 when lebron and bosh joined. He had 2 all star teammates in both of the seasons I was comparing  In 2010-11 with 2 other all stars he averaged 26/6/5 during the season and 25/7/4 in the playoffs  In 2012-13 he put up 21/5/5 then and 16/5/5 in the playoffs.  That is a massive decline in production, and it was not as a result of bosh and lebron taking away stats from him.  Bosh went from averaging 19/8/2 in the 2010-11 regular season to 17/7/2 in 2012-13. In the playoffs he went from 19/9 in 2011 to averaging 12/7 in 2013  Lebrons averaged 27/8/7 in the 2011 regular season and also 27/8/7 in 2013. In the 2011 playoffs he went from averaging 24/8/6 to 26/8/7  Bosh and James' combined stats in 2012-13 was lower than in the 2011 season, so it doesn't make sense to say that wades stats decreased that significantly from 2011 to 2013 as a result of his 2 all star teammates taking away stats from him.

Failing LeBron James who got BRUTALLY destroyed in the NBA finals by good guy Kevin Durant will never surpass Mike. SAD!
"12 seconds in the fourth, lebron with 48. Lonzo brings the ball across half court. 9 seconds. Pass to james on the wing, he stares his man down. Kevin durant stares him back in the way only a snake can.  8 seconds.   Lebron makes his move. a quick burst and a crossover leave him wide open in the lane, 3 seconds, lebron gathers the ball and takes his step.  2 seconds. the ball floats out of the kings fingers, and begins bouncing off the rim seemingly in slow motion. the buzzer sounds and the ball drops through the net.

"Lakers fans never cease to amaze me.   Imagine complaining about getting LeBron James. I'm sure not all of you are like this, but goddamn, Laker fans are toxic af."
"He hasn't reinvented his game yet though, he's taking the same amount of shots and 3pt attempts as last year. I'd agree that he *needs* to reinvent it, he's not good enough with the ball to justify taking it out of the other playmaker's hands or using him as the primary creator, and he's not exactly spacing the floor. If his best skill is undermined by playing in lineups with Lebron James, then maybe he just needs to run the bench unit. "
"It's a few things, honestly, that some Suns fans are keen to, and some oblivious.  1) We're the Suns. We suck. We've sucked for awhile now. And not like, ""Oh no, the team is missing their number 1 contributor. Numbers 2 and 3 better really step up"". We haven't had a true 2 or 3 in years. Warren is really good, but it wasn't until he added the 3 point range this season that he truly became a true number 2. Lebron James couldn't have dragged our sorry asses to the playoffs (without Booker) the past couple years.  2) Up until this season, all Booker did was score. And I mean that 100%. He didn't play D. He didn't get assists or rebounds. He was a dynamite scorer, but that's not enough for a superstar player, let alone with the surrounding cast he has had. I disagree with everyone who said he ""put up empty stats on a bad team"", but I could see the argument they would make (when they chose to say more than that before memeing).  3) He isn't a dirty player by any means, but he has had his temper flares here and there. Players on bad teams get much less slack for this. Doesn't help that we've had other attitude issues on our team the past couple years.  4) Our franchise has been the butt of the joke for a bit now. Constant coaching changes, talent leaving left and right, Bledsoe not wanting to be here, etc. All of this makes it harder to care about the Suns and the players.  Honestly, I haven't been convinced yet that Booker is our next superstar team leader of the franchise, which is probably why it's easy for me to say all of this. However, if he is able to keep developing like he has been, I'm all on board.  And sorry for the essay, I'm on a boring car ride home from work and needed a distraction."
"I mean yeah he's LeBron James. Watching some of those plays though, Ben can do a lot of the stuff that LeBron does with Lonzo, like cutting and rolling to the rim.  "
Why does Ben Simmons get compared to Magic Johnson and Lebron James?
LeBron james is on your team simply because it’s in Los Angeles
"I disagree on reddit not liking conflict. The amount of e-thugging and insults thrown around reddit is crazy. That is also why Jimmy has so many supporters on reddit.  These are mostly kids talking about how tough they are on the internet.  There are great leaders in the NBA, LeBron James comes to mind, but Butler and PG13 aren't that (PG was the only vocal Butler supporter I remember actually, maybe there were more, but other great leaders like Kevin Garnett sided with KAT). The top leaders though generally are in the military or upper level corporate, and Butler's antics would not have been tolerated in either setting. "
Notre Dame:   LeBron James  /s 
"I disagree 100%. It was obvious that the Heatles would struggle atleast during the first season because they litereally had no bench. Guys like James Jones and Anthony would not have played for any other team. Chalmers and Cole would've been 15-23 mpg guys for other teams. On the other hand the Dubs were a 70 win team that exchanged Barnes for Durant. They had a functioning system and just super upgraded one position from a solid you starter to a MVP caliber player. Pretty much no adjustment needed and they were still deep as hell. Don't get me wrong Heatles are 2nd easily in that regard, especially since no one expected that Wade would suddenly forget how to shoot 3's, but GSW take 1st.  Also lets not forget that the Lakers were the team to beat during that season. They had Kobe+Gasol+Bynum. This core just complemented itself so much better than Wade+Lebron+Bosh, they were deeper with a lot of talent of the bench and coming off a 2-peat. They were the team to beat that season even though the Heatles took the spotlike. The fact that Dallas won 4-0 was the single biggest shocker that season and a total collapse from LA that made sense whatsoever, even in hindsight. "
"This is wrong lol. Obviously you want your players to work hard and to be held accountable, but how you communicate that with players, coaches and media is what separates true leaders (i.e. Lebron James) from those who can destroy locker rooms and relationships (I.e. Jimmy Butler). "
"Well in his defense, he is a really good passer. He just doesn't get many opportunities to run the offense with LeBron James (and Rondo) on his team."
"That what Durant did was somehow worse or created less parity than the Lebron Heat team. The Warriors as a team were and are insane in terms of winning, but prime Lebron James (now considered the GOAT yes?) prime Dwyane Wade and prime Chris Bosh all taking cuts to sign with the Heat was nuts. Like no teams could realistically compete with them talent-wise (their bench was even sick with all the nba older vets taking huge paycuts) and yet they lost two finals. That that has been cut out of the collective psyche is insane."

"It's not a fluke though. [This has been posted a couple of times.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a00472/nba_ratings_are_down_26_percent_yearoveryear_on/) The big reason it's down isn't because of the no Lebron games (there's actually been 2 Lakers games) it's because normally a Lebron game would be on prime time on the East Coast.

"26% of people didn't cut the cord. Also, NFL is up.       There are 2 transcendent superstars in the NBA. By superstars, I mean they transcend culture and are well-known beyond basketball circles. LeBron James and Steph Curry. You could *maybe* include Kevin Durant.      Either way, they are all in the west. For casual fans, the players to watch all play at 10:30pm EST during the week, so they aren't going to watch. This leads to a huge decline in ratings, like the 26% you see from TNT.       Additionally, I know many fans that have forgone watching a lot of games this year simply because it doesn't matter. Sure, /r/nba will get hype midway through and keep that hype towards the end of the season that the Warriors *can* be beat, but we know it isn't true. They'll flip the switch in the playoffs and run the table. /r/nba will do again what they did last year, which is stomp around and whine that the Warriors are unfair and it's stupid.        The thing is, many NBA fans already have done that last part. There is no reason to watch games right now for casual to mid-level fans. The ones who love their team will watch, sure. The ones who kinda have interest, e.g. the large contingent who will watch *if* their team is successful and has a shot at the playoffs + championship, won't. It makes no sense to do so when you know who wins.      Why read the book when you know exactly how it ends? People hate spoilers, and the Warriors are a giant season spoiler. "
Curry fans trying to argue that he was good for most of the 2015 and 2016 finals. No one back then was saying that. He was underwhelming in both series by his standards (mostly 2016).  2015 in particular gets defended a lot.

I mean he wasn’t. He tried along with the spurs trying. But it just was not a perfect fit. Kawhi is just a really hard working player that let’s his actions speak for him. Timmy was the same but he was also vocal. Just think of Lebron James being a Kawhi Leonard. It just doesn’t fit. And lebron is one hell of a leader 
Tbf we didnt need Lebron James on our team to make hypothetically lopsided trades for ourselves
I know - I mean it’d be stupid to use his stats this season to say he’ll be the next LeBron James or James Harden. Just wanted to point out that what he’s doing is impressive regardless. 
Name a more iconic duo?  Team Lebron James is on and lopsided trades in favor of team with Lebron James.
I agree 100% with your analysis...... very spot on! The way people were speaking about Wiggins right before the draft came around they made him sound like the second coming of Lebron James himself but so far he seems more like just another guy on the team rather than a guy that can carry the team.   Wiggins flew under the radar a bit where as a guy like Fultz.... what hurt him the most was the fact that the year he came out there were 2 other rookies that looked like they were all-star level in Tatum and D Mitchell.  If those two played last year like they are currently playing on losing teams then I think Fultz could've flew under the radar playing badly but we all know that didn't happen so....

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.   People on this subreddit hate Luka Doncic.   The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Doncic in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.   Luka’s game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Luka Doncic, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Luka in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Luka is better.  You might be jealous of Luka’s five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Luka isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Luka talk to the adults. Fair?"

The common statement was that he was doing the best job out of all those guys last year, not that he is overall better than them. And I don't think that's worth holding on to this season because he hasn't been getting anywhere close to that same praise. To quote Frozen, let it gooOOoooo"
MJ could give two shits about LeBron James.
"He is respected from NBA coaches, especially coach Gregg Popovic, but I just can't imagine LeBron James putting up with his coaching. Altho I would love to see that."
Lebron James also won rookie of the year...I would say he's pretty good
"James harden takes more shots and is less efficient than kyrie, every year of kyries prime thus far has been spent playing with either Lebron and Kevin love, or Tatum, brown, Hayward, and horford, a lot of the time harden is the only guy on the floor who can create his own shot for the rockets. Harden is not a better scorer than kyrie, he is just tasked with scoring more, and his *playmaking* opens up his game to more than kyries does, which is what I said earlier.  "
"For sure. But if there were teams in other countries and basketball was worldwide, there might be. Eventually a lebron james would go play for spain or some shit and then bam.

"Im sorry im not apologizing for finding it absolutely insane that a 6'11"" power bottom defeated Lebron James in the ECF and then got his shit pushed in by Kobe "
An and-1 still gives you 2 points *and then a free throw* though. It's an insanely efficient possession in its own right (more efficient than just 2 free throws). It's a lack of effort to actually score the basketball when he's an insanely good scorer without all this foul bs. You don't see guys like LeBron or Russ or Giannis pull this kinda crap and they still get to the line a ton. If James Harden was just playing hard every time up and getting these kind of FTA numbers it would be one thing but the guy abuses and manipulates the NBA rule book to get foul calls. Especially in egregious situations where he initiates contact with the defender and will get in the defender's space to hook their body parts and then start a half-assed shooting motion. 
"Playoffs stats never count during regular season stats. For example, Deebo's 229 in the All-time scoring charts, but they don't count his playoffs points for that, if they did he'd actually be 185. Some great players don't make the playoffs as much because they play for a trash team, and some don't go as far because Michael Jordan/LeBron James exist so counting all those stats towards your regular season records is unfair. Not to mention, playoffs are harder because the opposing team actually scouts you.  That's why they always add the words ""in a playoff"" when talking about playoff performances. Because they're 2 separate things."
"Only 3 active players have had a top 50 of all time season in FTA per game:  Dwight Howard (#17 - 2010/11, #35 - 2007/08, #45 - 2008/09)  James Harden (#36 - 2016/17)  Dwyane Wade (#47 - 2005/06)  **Number of seasons with 10 FTA or more per game:**  Wilt Chamberlain: 10  Shaquille O'Neal: 7  Oscar Robertson: 6  Moses Malone: 6  Karl Malone: 6  Jerry West: 5  James Harden: 4  LeBron James: 3  Dwight Howard: 3  Dwyane Wade: 1  Kevin Durant: 1  Kobe Bryant: 1  Russell Westbrook: 1 "
Can we get one for lebron james and curry aswell? marcus smart
"So James drives about 7 more times than Lebron and they get fouled at the same percentage on their drives. So if Lebron actually drove as much as Harden, he'd have similar if not identical FTA/Gm if the trend continued linearly. Am I reading that right? "
Not when a circle jerk is in progress. It was a pretty legit charge imo. A 265 pound LeBron James initiated contact and dropped a shoulder/elbow into nurk but we're all here acting like that was IT coming down the lane and nurk should have been a brick wall when trying to take a charge
"It's why lebron ""freight train"" James started flopping a lot in Miami  That became the hottest meme for some time lol. Photoshopping his flailing body at some pics lol"

"When did I say he had no help?   &gt; accept Lebron James isn't as good a defender  &gt; cavaliers got smacked in the finals   &gt; it's clear who the better team is  Lol so many stabs in your sentences and yet I'm the one who's bias??

Lebron’s FG% is ridiculous because he is:  1. A perimeter player primarily driving the ball 2. Taking way more outside shots than a big man would (5.1 threes per game attempted; average shot distance 11ft compared to Davis’ 9ft)   It’s almost as if context matters when you talk about stats.

"I'd have a problem ever calling KD the goat just because he joined the machine that is the Warriors. If you take KD off Golden State, they'd still kick ass, probably make it to the finals every year and be likely to win!  I mean just look back at the Dubs in 2015-2016, they did not by any means NEED KD. If you were to take LeBron off the Heat/Cavs, you're talking about struggling to make the playoffs with no realistic chance of bringing home a trophy. Do you think a James-less Cavs team could ever take on the Warriors? I don't. LeBron putting his teams on his back and taking them to the playoffs 8 times is pretty damn impressive, regardless of his record. Add 3 titles and 3 MVPs and you're talking candidacy for the goat baby! "
In feb I get to see my favorite team AND Lebron James in one night. Somebody hold me I’m gonna cry 
"Here ya go if you don't have insider:  What impact will James Harden's injury have on the Houston Rockets and the NBA as a whole?  Harden was diagnosed Monday with a Grade 2 strain of his left hamstring, suffered during the fourth quarter of Sunday's double-OT win over the Los Angeles Lakers. He's expected to miss at least two weeks, including Thursday's matchup of the top two teams in the Western Conference, the Rockets and the Golden State Warriors in Houston.   While Houston has survived an extended absence from its other star guard, Chris Paul, playing without Harden will be a different challenge. Since coming to Houston in 2012, Harden has never missed more than three consecutive games, and he had missed just two in the previous three seasons. So what are the implications of his injury? Let's take a look.   Rockets offense will rely on Paul:  The good news for Houston is the team still has a future Hall of Famer to run the offense in Paul, a luxury the team wouldn't have had in the event of a Harden injury in previous seasons. Clearly, the Rockets are at their best with both Harden and Paul, having gone 16-2 with Paul in the lineup. But Houston was 10-7 with an impressive plus-4.8 point differential in the 17 games Paul missed, including 10-4 during his extended absence with a bruised left knee.  While Harden and Paul were still developing chemistry as a backcourt tandem, the Rockets have dominated with Paul on the court and Harden on the bench, typically against opposing second units. They've outscored opponents by an incredible 21.5 points per 100 possessions in those situations, according to NBA.com/Stats, with Paul averaging 27.3 points and 14.1 assists per 36 minutes. (Don't expect him to keep that up.)  Perhaps the biggest difference between a Houston team built around Paul and one with Harden as the lone star point guard is the latter's durability. Harden has averaged 36.9 minutes in games the Rockets have played without Paul, slightly higher than his average with both guards (35.8 MPG). Though his injuries have been a factor, Paul has averaged just 31.4 minutes and played more than 36 in a game only three times -- including Sunday's double-OT game.  That difference is meaningful because, according to NBA.com/Stats, Houston has been just an average team (plus-0.4 points per 100 possessions) in 149 minutes with both Harden and Paul on the bench and Eric Gordon on the court. Harden's absence also will give Gordon more responsibility. He has averaged 31.7 points and 4.8 assists (as well as 5.1 turnovers) per 36 minutes playing without either Harden or Paul.  How much will Harden's absence affect Houston's record?  The schedule will be reasonably favorable for the Rockets over the next two weeks. Three of their next six opponents (the Chicago Bulls, Orlando Magic and Phoenix Suns) rank in the bottom five of ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI), and Houston faces only one top-10 team in BPI. And that one is a doozy, as the Warriors will be trying to avenge losing to the Rockets at home in the season opener.   It's possible Harden could miss both remaining matchups against Golden State, which travels to Houston for a matchup on Jan. 20. That would hurt the Rockets' chances of catching the Warriors for the top seed in the Western Conference. Because of Golden State's superior record, preseason projection and point differential, BPI currently gives Houston just a 14 percent chance of earning the No. 1 seed. Losing the season series would cause that percentage to dwindle.  The Rockets' chances at the top spot in the West already have been hurt by their recent five-game losing streak, three of those games played without Paul. Injuries to starting center Clint Capela (who missed four of the five losses with a heel contusion and an orbital fracture) and reserve Luc Mbah a Moute (who hasn't played since Dec. 15 due to a shoulder dislocation) also have been a factor in Houston's struggles. Capela returned Sunday night, and Mbah a Moute is expected back in early January.  While we've focused mostly on the offensive end so far, uncharacteristically poor defense was perhaps a bigger factor in the Rockets' five-game losing streak. That can be tied largely to opponents making 42 percent of their 3s during the losing streak, far worse than any team has allowed over the course of the season. (Opponents have shot best against the Milwaukee Bucks, 39 percent.) Stouter defense could help Houston survive even if the offense suffers without Harden.  Harden's absence could open up MVP race:  Harden's absence also could affect the MVP race. Harden looked like the early favorite for MVP, having finished atop a straw poll of media members conducted by Tim Bontemps of the Washington Post last month.  If Harden is out only a couple of weeks and the Rockets struggle without him, it's possible that his injury could actually solidify his MVP case. We saw that happen with another Mike D'Antoni point guard, Steve Nash, when the Suns went 2-5 during the seven games he missed in the 2004-05 season.  More likely, however, Harden's MVP chances will suffer -- particularly if he misses an extended period of time. Just one MVP since Bill Walton in 1977-78 has missed more than the seven games Nash missed: Allen Iverson played 71 games in 2000-01.   That's good news for LeBron James, who is trying to win his first MVP since 2012-13 and the fifth of his incredible career. James already leads Harden in my wins above replacement player metric, as well as Basketball-Reference.com's value over replacement player, though Harden held the narrow edge in wins based on ESPN's real plus-minus. If James can stay healthy, he has a chance to become the clear leader in terms of value-based advanced statistics.  Given Harden has twice finished as runner-up for MVP, including last season, it would be disappointing if an injury cost him what looked like his best chance at the award. But that's one of the many possible impacts of Harden's hamstring strain."

"This is underrated. Kyrie is overall more efficient at shooting the ball and better at dribbling, but IT got to the line enough times to make up the difference. The only reason the difference might matter is in one on one iso situations - and like, the Cavs still have Lebron James, so I'm sure they can live with that.  "
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
LeBron James 
Lol he won. he didn't need to statpad like lebroom James. Lebron took the L. Similarly speaking Kyrie deserved the 2016 finals MVP. He was robbed just like curry. Anyway how does lebrons dick taste?
"How, Jordan had the best team in the league. He never had teams as bad as Lebron has had on the way to the finals. Hardly any teams have ever been as stacked as his aside from laker teams that have won the finals. You could argue that the current warriors are nearly as stacked, but then we take into account the greater landscape of ridiculous talent around the league today. We talk about Cousins and AD being among the greatest in their respective positions. James Harden and CP3. Westbrook, melo and pg13. Not to mention Lebron, love, wade and soon to be IT. Him being disqualified is a load of shit. The talent around the league is insane, and simply because they arent playing up to par, it shouldnt discredit his performance on that team.  Now I agree he will never get the same respect, but that is simply due to the massive dick sucking of Jordan who helped get the NBA to where it is now. That's the ONLY reason Jordan is considered in the goat convo. Because he was the face of the NBA. So many players today have the same skillset and better athleticism than he does. The greatest of all time players will always be the in the current Era because they will typically be better players, as we become better athletes.  Legacy and GOAT convos are a load of shit that stomp on logic.  Updoot for you though since the only unfortunate truth you spoke was that not all rings are equal."
"Kawhi's a top 5 player but he's played like 2 games this season. I don't see anywhere near that amount of respect given to Isaiah Thomas, who was 3rd in the league in scoring last season, made the All-NBA second team, and was top 10 in most advanced stat categories. But he hasn't played a game yet this season so nobody talks about his play.   So for the purpose of ""top 10 players in the league right now"" I'm gonna exclude Kawhi, IT, and also Chris Paul due to lack of games played.  Here's my personal top 15 for players this season so far. Format is (Name) - (PER) - (Win Shares) - (VORP).  1. James Harden - 30.6 - 8.1 - 4.0 2. LeBron James - 30.2 - 7.2 - 4.3 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 29.8 - 6.4 - 2.8 4. Stephen Curry - 28.7 - 4.7 - 2.1 5. Kyrie Irving - 25.3 - 5.8 - 2.5 6. Russel Westbrook - 24.5 - 4.7 - 3.6 7. Kevin Durant - 24.8 - 4.7 - 2.0 8. Anthony Davis - 28.4 - 5.5 - 1.8 9. DeMar DeRozan - 23.6 - 5.2 - 1.6 10. LaMarcus Alrdrige - 23.7 - 5.0 - 1.4 11. Karl-Anthony Towns - 23.2 - 5.6 - 2.2 12. Andre Drummond - 23.1 - 4.7 - 2.5 13. Jimmy Butler - 22.5 - 5.2 - 2.1 14. Damian Lillard - 22.6 - 4.5 - 2.1 15. Al Horford - 19.2 - 4.8 - 2.2  Paul George, John Wall, Klay, and Dray don't rate this season. They would be in the next set of names with the likes of Cousins, Lowry, Jokic, Oladipo, Beal, Tyreke Evans, Otto Porter, Kemba Walker, and Kevin Love.  I rate KD, Draymond, and Klay so low because that's what their advanced stats show. I think this can be credited to just Golden State being Golden State. When you have 2 hall of famers and 4 All-Stars, each one doesn't have to carry the load a player of their calibre normally has to on a 1 or 2 all star team.  People have been sleeping on Drummond and LMA's seasons.  I probably rated KAT too high, but his numbers are there. One thing all advanced stats have a hard time showing is defense, which is KAT's biggest weakness."
LeBron James 63 points for the Heat  You’d think it’d be Wade. He only has like 56
I'm going to get downvoted because of flair but LeBron James   edit: love getting downvoted and getting PM'd hostile messages just for having an opinion
"By WS:  40's: Bob Feerick   50's: Dolph Schayes   60's: Wilt Chamberlain   70's: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   80's: Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are very close, would be a shame to name only one   90's: Karl Malone   00's: Dirk Nowitzki     10's: LeBron James"
"If by dark horse you mean the assassination of LeBron James, Steph Curry and KD(both have to be out for Celtics to beat the warriors) then sure.  Barring a LeBron injury or move to the West, Celtics aren't sniffing the finals in the next 5 years."
"Gonna be honest. When I read the title, I was confused at first. People usually refer to LeBron James as LeBron and James Harden as Harden. I had no idea who you were talking about till I read the post."
&gt;When you hate James Harden so much you bring him up in a LeBron Durant debate.
LeBron James 
And your 2017/2018 NBA MVP is: LeBron JAMES!
LeBron James Harden tied @ #1 in points
"LeBron asked me to ask you what it means to be ""a year older""???? Mr. James really isn't sure what that is or how it applies to him, so he's just going to assume it doesn't and forget about it."
This is the 19th time ever a player has put up at least 52/5/8 (20th if you count playoffs)  Every other player to do this:  Wilt Chamberlain     Oscar Robertson     Tiny Archibald     Rick Barry     Michael Jordan     Michael Adams     Reggie Miller     Kobe Bryant     Gilbert Arenas     Tony Parker     LeBron James     Russell Westbrook     Kemba Walker     James Harden      (And Jerry West if you count playoffs)
"Hard to say. Anything can happen. LeBron, Boogie and PG could all sign with us and we'd be back to contender status. But as it stands right now, the Knicks do have the better future.  Your building block players, KP, Ron Baker and FranK, are easily better than our BBPs, Montekuzma, Lonzi Scheme, Brandon Instagram and Kevin Hart.   There are probably Lakers fans who will react violently to this and say something like Kuzma, the 2nd cumming of Kobe and James Worthy combined, has a vastly higher ceiling than KP. Pay no attention to these folks. Kuzma is great but he's not the 2-way game-changing player that KP is."
" That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Kyrie Irving moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Chris Paul see the game from an x and o perspective, Kyrie has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event. There's a reason Kyrie was able to lead LeBron James to the 2016 Finals. Put simply, Irving is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Goran Dragic or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Irving's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like Irving, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Kyrie."
It's destined: LeBron James 2017-18 NBA MVP
"There is a misconception on this subreddit among ill-informed Lebronstans that their god-emperor Jebron Lames is ""the best player in the NBA."" However, let me, an intellectual, enlighten you as to why Joel ""The Process"" Embiid is a far better player than LeBron James:  Filthy casuals who only watch Lebron highlights think that for some reason Lebron is a good shot blocker, just because he gets a few chasedown blocks abusing midget scrubs like Isaiah Thomas. But in fact, Lebrony is averaging a mere 1 block per game, as opposed to the thick, solid, tight mound in the paint that is Joel Embiid. Embiid averages twice as many blocks as Lebron per game, even though Lebron's played nine more games than him.  Embiid is a grade A straight savage who lays down sick roasts on Twitter. Lebron hates him because he ain't him, so he tries to imitate him by calling our President a ""bum."" While Embiid is an expert at exerting his mental dominance, Lebron James is busy insulting the President.  Number of Finals lost. Lebron - 4. Embiid - 0. Funny joke: What's the difference between a dollar bill and Lebron James? A dollar bill can give you four quarters! Joel Embiid doesn't disappear against a trash Mavs team that played defensive sieve Dirk Nowitzki in the NBA Finals. While Lebron was being cuckolded by Delonte West, Joel Embiid was smashing Beyonce.  Embiid is better at chasedown blocks  Lions defeated: Embiid - 1. Lebron - 0. The only way Lebron can beat a lion is if he decided to go play tight end for his hometown Browns. Oh and by the way, Embiid's football team is 13-3 while Lebron's is 0-16. Maybe if Lebron hadn't ditched Cleveland for Miami, he wouldn't have sent the Browns into their downward spiral.  Hopefully some of you pea-brained ignoramuses that frequent this sub spitting out shitty hot takes like ""Lebron is better than Joel Embiid"" can understand the facts instead of bullshit opinions thrown at you by Lebron stans who would rather bathe in a pool of Lebron's chocolate-milk-colored baby paste ignorantly than acknowledge the truth:  Joel Embiid is a more skilled, more athletic, more clutch, more ruthless, version of today's washed-up Jebron Lames."
Why Lebron James won't wish me a happy birthday
lebron said seeing his opponent wearing his shoes gives him a mental edge over that guy. so theres that  http://footwearnews.com/2015/focus/athletic-outdoor/nike-lebron-james-opponents-wear-his-sneakers-161521/
He got traded to the team with Lebron James. There’s far worse fates than that. 
"Well that's not always a good thing though: https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2016/7/22/12261860/la-lakers-free-agency-demar-derozan-toronto-raptors  &gt; Amid that support, those close to DeRozan did not express remorse he will not play in Los Angeles year round. Thomas believed DeRozan would encounter too many “distractions” with hometown friends asking too much of his time.  &gt; There is a lot to unpack here, but probably most notable is how (despite LeBron James doing otherwise in a high profile example) most NBA free agents don’t necessarily want to play for their hometown team. Whether DeRozan opted not to because he truly loves Toronto, or because he was worried about “distractions” in L.A., or some combination of both, it doesn’t really matter. Those are just two of the plenty of reasons players from a certain city may not want to return to work there.  Also that last 2 paragraph of that article is pure gold in retrospect. "
Lebron James stats for the first 6 games was mildly underperforming. If he had lost people would be saying that he choked in the 2013 Finals   
Lebron James Harden with the most points in 2017.
I'd like to congratulate Lebron James on his 5th MVP. 
There have been some really fucked up posts the last few days but the mods have removed them. One was like a Michael Jordan and LeBron James fantasy or some shit that was fucked. 
Yeah there’s not like there was ever a rookie who did amazing with bad shooting and free throws /s LEBRON JAMES
"Hate or not, I can deny he deserves an MVP. I don't think it's unreasonable to believe LeBron James is having an MVP year."
"This is the second time a boston fan has quoted this article without even reading the article lmfao  “I would say that I don't really have an individual rivalry.,"" James said. ""I would say Boston is a rival of mine because I've met them so many times in the postseason. ”   Lebron stated that his rivalry was more with the celtics.  Not pierce.  He said he has no rival."

"Kyrie's Kings are coming off of their first ring after defeating Giannis and the Bucks. Those Bucks have two rings themselves, and Giannis has won several DPOY awards and is widely regarded as the best defender in the leauge. They always perform well below expectations in the regular season before playing at an elite level in the playoffs. James Harden has won several MVP's and is the best player in the leauge, but his 1-4 record in the finals have tarnished his reputation. Cash Stanley is the reigning MVP. Lebron is still a Cav, but has not had much success as of late. Warriors and Rockets and Cavs have all kept their cores together. Paul George is back in Indiana, and Melo has joined Kyrie in Sacremento. The Raptors have (finally) blown their team up, trading Lowry, Derozan and Ibaka. Kemba replaced Kyrie in Boston, though his numbers are worse than when he was in Charlotte. Paul Milsap is no longer a Nugget. Marc Gasol is in the East. Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin are still Clippers. Hayward is still a Celtic. Paul Pierce is working for the Nets. The 76er's, Bucks and Cavs are good in the East, while the Rockets, Warriors and Kings rule the West. The Bulls haven't been to the playoffs since 2017 and are by far the worst team in the leauge, while the Grizzlies have also been bad as of late, though they still have Mike Conley. The Pistons, who were elite from 2018-2021, have once again fallen from grace and are now one of the worst teams in the leauge. Also, the Raptors suck. The Warriors, while elite, have not reached the dominance they had in 2016-17 in the last 5 years, and in these last 5 years have been just a normal good team. Ditto for the Cavs. Also, the Spurs are bad, having missed the playoffs 3 of the last 4 years. None of the Ball Brothers play on the same team as each other. "

"Except steals are a better indicator of defense than rebounds.  The best defender doesn't always get the award...HOWEVER....if LeBron was better than Jordan at defense he would have atleast gotten 1 by now.  Why was Jordan without a doubt the best defender in the league at one point but not James? Kind of weird.  Also you mentioned MVPs, which Jordan has more of than James. Jordan was considered not only the best defender at one point but also without a doubt the best player, more times than James.  Also 6/6 in Finals appearances.  Never went to a game 7.

"Offense board crashing is all on Ty Lue,  I seriously wonder if he even does anything other than being a symbolic figurehead puppet for LeBron. Implement a ball moving offense too and you get players more rest to use their energy on D since efficiency would go up prevent transition opportunities and you can slow the play down. End of the day in playoffs King James will carry them to the wins in the East, but when they face the talent of GSW the weaknesses you highlight will be abused.   Btw it's not like Tristan needs the boards to stat pad, he has a massive contract. Makes me more convinced it's the lack of coaching, not telling him to fix a detrimental habit."

"As great as LeBron James is, his immaturity and entitled attitude does a lot of harm to a weaker franchise when he plays for them. At least during the regular season.  It seems like he got Ty Lue in the position he's in because he'll let LeBron steamroll him, which has kind of left him paralyzed.  If LeBron played inside an actual system, he may be more constrained as an individual player but the team overall might do better.  Plus it must be kind of demoralizing to play alongside LeBron and get cold as you hardly ever see the ball. You only see it when LeBron wants you to, which happens when he decides he can't score himself or he wants to dish it out to you for dat sweet assist.   If you make the shot, he's the king of assists and greatest all around player of all-time. If you don't make it, you just let the team down but it was still a brilliant effort from LeBron. So either way, LeBron himself shirks the blame.  That's pretty weak imo."

"Eh, i think it depends.   Does it help you hit a ball further in baseball? Throw the ball further and with more power? Pitch at a higher velocity? Sure, but the timing to hit a baseball (that’s faster with PED use by pitchers in this scenario) and the mechanics needed to control a pitch with pinpoint accuracy make it less impactful than most would assume.  In basketball, if you were Kristap vs LeBron, you’d rather be LeBron for the physicality of your drives to the rim. Sure, you need some touch and handling abilities, but it’s more physical than baseball by a long shot. So it would help you on drives, defensively in terms of increased size and speed (assuming you do it right), and recovery. The only thing it won’t help with you a whole lot is a jump shot, though you will be able to keep fresher legs throughout a season and a game.   So does it help more in baseball than basketball? I doubt it, probably more in basketball, but regardless you still had to have talent without it to be good in either. Not entirely true in football.  The reason baseball has such a bad rep for it, is because they actually test for it. Like, serious James Bonds investigation, work with the FBI and congress on it level. No other league does that."

"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry could easily be seeking $500M deals but because of the NBA's salary cap system, they're restricted to a set amount.

lebron would have if a knicks media member didn't vote for carmelo for the memes  edit: it was [gary washburn from the boston globe lol](http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9244504/lebron-james-miami-heat-1-vote-shy-unanimous-mvp-honor). either way the unanimous thing is so overblown since lebron was 1 idiot's vote away from being unanimous
"Yes I am. Magic Johnson done fucked up the Lakers. As soon as I heard he was taking over I knew the Lakers were going to be fucked because of the illogical moves he could make. The Lakers were set with D’Angelo Russell for the 2018 season. The lineup this year could have been Lonzo, D-Lo, Ingram, Kuzma, and Randle. Instead he traded to get rid of a bad contract which is completely unnecessary in order to get the 27th pick in the draft. He gets all the credit for Kyle Kuzma which only somewhat justifies this trade but really Joey Buss, Lakers draft scout chose this player as he always finds a gem in the draft every single year. I have to watch a losing team who has almost the same record only 5 wins less 5 years ago because Magic made this team to prepare for next season. LeBron James is predicted to have a low chance to coming, and DeMarcus Cousins likes New Orleans. Magic Johnson illogically traded for Brook Lopez, and KCP, who I would debate almost everybody on r/nba saw them having trash seasons coming. The Lakers could have gone after Dwayne Wade and Rajan Rondo or are both having excellent seasons but again rolled the dice on a trash player Tyler Ennis who is playing D-League level basketball with the exception of one game because the rest of the team has sucked recently. All of this was to create a competitive 8,9 or 10th seed basketball team so LeBron or Demarcus Cousins would want to join the Lakers but the front office is getting exposed for being so bad at building a team around Lonzo Ball. They went and got a player with no offense and overrated defense to play the starting SG and a slow center who can’t play in today’s NBA, only has experience with the NBA’s worst franchise recently, and hurts the team more than he helps the team to play Center. This is the absolute worst time to be a Lakers fan as it seems to ruin my experience as an NBA fan. When your team is this trash you can’t experience how good other teams are. When you argue how much better the NBA used to be you are actually arguing how much you have seen trash basketball. If you’re team has a small and bad fan base and a poor history you can make a strong case against the front office but when a front office fails the Lakers, you have to vary your options to bandwagon."
Lebron James
Tell that to LeBron James.
*One Century Later*   Lebron James leads the Cleveland Autobots to another Finals Appearance!
Well 2013 LeBron James is probably the best player of all time so... Ok 
"LeBron Raymone James  All things considered he contributes the most and thus he is the most valuable player. He is the Cavs whole offense, he is a catalyst to their defense and he rebounds."
"He was traded to a serious championship contender with Lebron James. Not like they shipped him to Phoenix. Paul was drafted by BOS, played here almost his entire career, and was a Finals MVP. We're retiring a HOF'ers jersey, not a guy who constantly mentioned ""a brinks truck"" when asked about his contract. These tribute videos are getting out of hand, and to consider showing one for a guy who Was there less than 3 years the same night as a guy on the level of PAUL PIERCE?!?! Get the fuck outta here "
"&gt; The point of OP’s post is not the intent of Harden’s play, but that Harden is not shooting free throws at an advantageous percentage.   And my point is that *the evidence presented doesn't support this conclusion*. We only know that he's driving / shooting / shooting FTA at a high rate, we don't know what his ""deserved"" rate is, which would dictate whether or not he's doing it at a disadvantageous or advantageous rate.  &gt; He’s getting calls proportionately to his volume. So whether he’s trying to get fouled or not isn’t relevant.  He's getting calls proportionate to LeBron James at a higher volume. Is Harden as good a driver as LeBron? *Should* he receive fouls at that rate? Shroder certainly doesn't, though he drives nearly enough. Driving volume alone isn't enough to conclude he deserves those fouls at that rate.  What he's trying to do *is* relevant, because the point of the post is to combat the perception that he's seeking fouls/flopping/selling contact. This data tells us some interesting stuff, but it doesn't tell us that. "
That's only true if you assume he deserves them at the same rate that LeBron James gets them.  Maybe he truly deserves to draw them at Shroder's rate and he is getting them at an advantageous rate. Maybe he should get them at the same pace Giannis does. This data doesn't really give us any insight into that question.
"He gets them at the same rate as LeBron James while driving. Shroder drives nearly as much as Harden and gets far fewer. Does he deserve as many FTA per drive as LeBron? Subjectively I'm pretty hesitant to say so...  &gt; Most reasonable fans that watch him play know that both are true, these stats are for those who believe that he has the refs in his back pocket  I completely agree with this. It wasn't my intent to say that we should disregard OP's stats, merely to point out that some people are drawing some far fetched conclusions and this data can only tell a small part of the story.  "
Most NBA Player of the Month Awards (awarded since 1979-80):  LeBron James: 36  ...  Kobe Bryant: 17   Michael Jordan: 16   Kevin Durant: 14   Shaq: 12   Kevin Garnett: 9   Chris Paul: 8   Larry Bird: 7   Karl Malone: 7
"&gt; Obviously he fishes for calls and will sometimes bank on getting a call. But how are you to define whether a drive is “legitimate” or not? 95% of the time he is seeking a foul it probably also overlaps with him also believing he can get himself to the rim and finish.  There's no way for us to know what his intent is before he starts driving. There certainly *appears* to be plays where he completely gives up on making a basket in favor of selling real or imagined physical contact but he's far from the only one that does that. Some people think he does that more frequently than most superstar players but this data wouldn't really tell us much about that.   &gt; In the end it doesn’t really matter why he does what he does. What you conveniently ignored was that Op says it appears James is not over-earning fouls on drives relative to other players.   Well that depends, should all players earn fouls at equal rates when they drive? Harden isn't the physical beast that LeBron is, though he's also no slouch and a very good finisher, does he *deserve* to earn fouls at the same rate as LeBron just because he drives a lot? Shroder doesn't get them according to OP's chart. It would take more analysis than what's been provided by OP to be able to draw meaningful conclusions on the 'legitimacy' of foul calls received by any player.  &gt; He’s also 1st in 3PM with a defender within 2-4 feet on around 35%. He’s making the shots, and getting proportionate calls when driving. So I’m not really sure what your point is.  Just that OP's data, while interesting and useful, isn't enough for people to be making some of the conclusions presented in this comment chain. That's it.  I have my own opinions, but they're subjective and I wouldn't present them as anything more than my opinions.  I would be curious to see And-1/FTA rates (i.e. How often these players are finishing through contact vs. getting the call and missing the shot). There are probably other ways in which we could tease more information out of the data. "
"First, I really think LeBron himself is better than the whole Boston Big 3/4/5/6/7 WGAF. He just wasn't that good yet. Miami repeat LeBron beats the Boston Big 3 with every other player on both teams the same. Second, Boston hated their own (Ray Allen) for leaving when the whole organization threw Ray Allen across the mud with no support from KG or PP. Obviously, LeBron wasn't gonna join boys like that. So he made a team of D-Wade and Bosh from scratch, which I repeat was unprecedented at the time.  KD was friends with Green and Steph. And perhaps he was much closer to them than WB. So the situations are drastically different, but don't forget for 1 second you boys burned his jersey, and hated on him leaving sooo much it emboldened the view of hatred against players leaving their teams. For example, if Cleveland fans praised and thanked James and cheered him the best, KD's departure by the mass public would be seen much differently."
"Lebron James should become a vegan. It will help extend the longevity of his peak, it will give his immune system a boost, and it'll also help him save money."
"Funny, that's the exact same sentiments I have towards IT. Loved him for the Celtics pre-trade. Hated him post-trade for his drawn out pity party.  At this point, I couldn't care less about IT. Dude has milked that trade for all it was worth (he has a six-part series on the Players Tribune ffs). Not only was Pierce a certified Boston legend, right up there with the best of them, he left the Celtics via trade to the fucking Nets, all to put us in an amazing spot for the future. We sent IT to play with LeBron James, and he's bitching? "
Actually lebron james didnt have great finals as well in 2013. And yes i know im getting downovoted
Nothing.  I am NBA Legend LeBron James.
Devin Booker is gonna be the next guy to average 35+ ppg .   It hurts me to say this but the gap between KD and Lebron is closing really fast.   Anthony Davis isn't close to top 5 until he wins a playoff game. He has no excuse this year with that team and they're a .500 team right now. Not good enough.   Beal is the best shooting guard in the NBA not named James Harden :)   Tim Duncan is mad overrated because he was drafted to the spurs. Same with Parker ginobli kawhi etc. LeBron might have 8 rings if he was drafted to the spurs.   There are a lot of players I would take over kawhi
LeBron James
"Is Russell Westbrook or James Harden the best player in the league?  There's more to it than that.  Kobe was awesome, and was a top-5 player for almost his whole career.  But he didn't have the kind of peak that a guy like Jordan, LeBron, Bird, or Magic did."
"[Drivers per game.](http://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1) I have no horse in this race. I'm here to provide what objective stats I can. James Harden has 17.9 drives per game to LeBron's 11.  [James Harden attempts 7.2 shots on those drives to LeBron's 4.9](http://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?sort=DRIVE_FGA&amp;dir=1)  [LeBron James has attempted 297 shots within 3 ft.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01/shooting/2018)  James Harden has attempted [203.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01/shooting/2018)  Now these are just empty numbers, but what I would conclude from this is that James Harden does in fact drive more often and more frequently than LeBron James. LeBron James does attempt more shots at the rim than James Harden does though."
LEBRON JAMES IS NOT GOING TO LA
"Honestly, DeMar DeRozan is probably a blacker name. LeBron could've had a good case for it too if his last names wasn't James. "
Dwight Howard is 1-0 in playoff series against LeBron James
All developed through good training. There's no excuse. It's LeBron James get it done

Skip Bayless: King of the Hot Take and Conductor of the LeBron James Hate Train.
Also Johnny Manziel is to the Cleveland Browns what LeBron James could have been to the Cleveland Cavaliers if LeBron was a monumental fuck up with a substance abuse problem. Other than that one subtle difference their careers have been almost identical.
Lebron James
"LeBron James, Chris Paul, Bobby Brown"
"I think the Player's Association gives us the best picture of who players look to as leaders.  Chris Paul has been the President of the NBA Player's Association since 2013, so I'm sure someone will make him head coach assuming he wants the job. Derek Fisher had the same role and coached his first year out of the league.  Anthony Tolliver has been a VP of the NBAPA since 2013, which is surprising. Maybe he's someone to watch out for.   By the way, other VPs are LeBron James, Andre Iguodala, Carmelo Anthony, Steph Curry, Garrett Temple, and Pau Gasol.  "
"well first of all, it's not like dunking with a trampoline.  I'm your average fat dad, and I can dunk with a trampoline.  I could not, however, be Lebron James.  Or anyone in the NBA for that matter.  My point is greatness will be great regardless.  Anyone in the NBA on PEDs would still be great without them.  You're also not going to give Singler PEDs and him turn into a superstar.    I disagree PEDs defeat the purpose of the game.  They do nothing but help the purpose.  From the player standpoint and from a fan standpoint.  Lets just say for a second that PEDs are 100% what makes all of the top 20 guys in the NBA the athletes and stars that they are.  Just say.  You're telling me you'd rather have them all suck and be clean?  No lebron, no curry, no KD, no westbrook, no Giannis, no AD, etc.  You don't care?  As long as the athletes are natural?  That's the dumbest thing in the world to me.  I'm a consumer.  I love watching Westbrook play, and I don't care what he does to train."
LEBRON JAMES WITH THE REJECTION!
100% no and that's no knock on LeBron James the players (who is the best in the world). What Steph brings to the city and the system is irreplaceable. 
"[Don't](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21763053/lebron-james-free-agency-future-unknown-los-angeles-lakers-holding-hope-nba) shoot the [messenger](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/247313/Sources-Building-Relationship-With-Rich-Paul-Was-Factor-In-Lakers-Signing-KCP), guy."
"You're right. I don't think he'd be able to go 82 games like that. But he's the closest we have to it I guess. I mean Kawhi Harden is essentially have a LeBron + or ++ right? I'd say Bron is closer to that 30/10 wing player with elite D than either Kawhi or James... Kawhi would have a long way to go to get that kind of playmaking, and is a little behind in scoring. James lacks the D obviously."
Lebron “LeUps” James 
"How is this accepted behavior? Bill Russell is 83 years old lol. His house was vandalized 50 years ago. Every major city in the U.S. had racist issues 50 years ago. Lebron James' house was vandalized with racist slurs in 2017. That doesn't mean the entire city of Cleveland is racist.  Adam Jones was called racist slurs by a few drunk fans. The next time he showed up, 30,000 people gave him a standing ovation.  So...30,000 people cheered him on because they disapproved of the behavior of 5 people. Which is more reflective?"
"But some people will hear the name LeBron James (none of these) and will disregard anything bad you say about them because they have a bias towards him, by removing names you remove that bias."
Kemba Walker  Anthony Davis  JJ Reddick   LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard    It's a wrap
did you just say Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are arguably better than LeBron James?

&gt;He played for several years on a shitty Cleveland team that was a lottery team without him.  Gee. I wonder who that reminds me of. Oh yeah the James Harden-led Rockets.   &gt;He’s not a baby back bitch because he doesn’t get pissy and foul out when his team is losing.  Not for that reason. He's a baby back bitch bc he does shameful shit like [this. ](https://youtu.be/aL33-XfVccg) They don't call him [LeFlop](https://youtu.be/m9M30ch_OvQ) for nothing.   Lebron has never played in the West and prolly never will unless he comes to the Rockets/Lakers. There's a reason why he created the Heatles. He couldn't do it on his own either.   &gt;This Cleveland team now doesn’t get out of the second round without LeBron. With him they’re going to yet another finals appearance.   Bc they're in the EAST which got even WEAKER. There's a reason they've had one of the easiest schedules so far this year. No shit he'll cakewalk his way to the finals every year. Nobody is even close to being as good as he is in the East. All of his real peers/competitors sit in the West.

"Yup. This sub is a joke so often. Anything LeBron or pop does is hailed even if it's moronic. Kyrie believes in a dumb theory and people act like he's entirely a dumbass just because of that one belief.

"Kevin Love is seriously underrated, granted he's playing with LeBron James so his stats may not be as impressive compared to his time in Minnesota. But if you watch him on the floor, he's truly one of the best big men in the league."
"Bro.   We built around a top 5 player to ever play. You see all those impact stats and raw numbers Lebron have? These are hugely based on our players who elevate Bron's skillsets. Lebron James' efficiency would plummet in isolation, heavy defensive fixation, settings.   It's crazy to me how we are blaming our franchise for correctly building around one of the best ever."
"So who was he talking to when he said ""no disrespect LeBron"" while looking directly at LeBron James?? Lol. But I'm a moron? What's the issue anyway?

"This is too generous.  LeBron is obviously one of the greatest individual talents of all time, and he's had the opportunity to cherry-pick the best possible fit for himself in basically every single season since he left Cleveland the first time.    However, despite his teams constantly being in win-now mode with league-highest or near-highest payrolls, attracting ring-chasing vets and dumping rookies, only one of his Miami seasons could reasonably be considered an all-time great team and all the others were merely very good.  His teams have broken 60 wins in the regular season once in the last 8 years.    Teams that feature LeBron James + a couple of all-stars + a bunch of veterans have a pretty high floor, basically the ECF or Finals assuming they play in the East.  But they have a much lower ceiling than you'd reasonably expect from that collection of talent.  Young players around him mostly stagnate.  All-star level players have to sublimate their games and become reduced to spot-up shooters in many cases -- incredibly, LeBron is able to keep his best teammates from playing to their potential while simultaneously getting credit for not having good enough teammates!  Vets that stand around the 3 point line do great with him, but, you know, that's partly where the low ceiling part comes from.  And his teams almost always get substantially worse over time because he demands that front offices sign awful contracts to keep his guys and isn't always a great judge of talent.  "
"As much as you’re right, SVG’s comments are reactionary to the changing landscape of sports journalism specific to ESPN. You’re forgetting that there are business interests at play. Coaches are fearful of their job security and the hostile environment ESPN might foster with it’s sensationalism. It’s not much different than Lebron James going solely through Sports Illustrated and spurning Woj or Gordon Hayward going through Players Tribune.   It’s a business relationship between ESPN &amp; the NBA. SVG is not spurning the media here. He’s boycotting ESPN and it’s coverage, which he has every right to do.  It’s really ironic considering what happened between Disney &amp; The LA Times last year. Now the positions are flipped, but ESPN has minimal leverage because it’s in a contract with the NBA"
"He gives money to where he wants, which I believe includes political organizations. So this argument makes no sense. No one gives two fucks that Lebron James advocated for Hillary Clinton. That was his right, but that didn’t change anything."

Masai has been good but don’t pretend like Casey has been handed a Kevin Durant or a Lebron James by Masai. In fact, every one of our main players developed into what they are today under Casey. DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, and of course the rookies, none of whom were any Ben Simmons or KATs. Fuck he turned 2nd round picks like Powell and undrafted no-names VanVleet into productive role-players.   Not taking anything away from Masai, but this narrative (pushed mostly by JV fanatics) is an extremely unfair one to Casey.   "
"That's not the same thing, either. Ball isn't an ESPN employee. He's not a FOX employee. He's just some rookie's dad..saying that his son's coach has ""lost the team"" and that they don't want to play for him; that's the equivalent of ESPN reporters coming to me for statements that they're going to broadcast all over their platform.  Imagine seeing this on ESPN ""u/bewarethegap says that Lebron James injects coke into his dick before every game"" and having SAS discuss that the next morning lol "
&gt;For me it's recency bias. LeBron James is the best player in the league and Durant is the second  For me this is proof that people on Reddit just reply based on the headline.  And in this case don't even read the headline correctly since Lebron has never played for the Warriors.

Dwight wasnt better then lebron then ill agree he was a beast but i dont think he has ever been better then james. That 07 team he carried to the finals was straight up one of the worse rosters without james on it. I know howard lead a not so good magic team to the finals but everything that howard had on that team was still better then anything james had in 07.
I think the NBA officially starting that Lebron James flopped would be worth more than 10-25k for him. 
Lmfao thanks for humoring me. Have you heard of Lebron James by any chance?
"Its also a ridiculous take considering one major factor that everyone who states this overlooks: there's never been a player like LeBron James in the history of the nba.   Sure you could say that MJ had to adopt to the triangle offense, but that mainly worked because he had pippen who was perfect for the triangle. The fact is no one has really been able to find a plug and play offense that would succeed after LeBron leaves while also maximizing his talent. Especially because there's never been a superstar alongside LeBron for more than 2 years (not Kyrie, im talking about like a prime wade type player who fell off fast) so kinda have to rely on LeBron.   Theres never been a player (not even MJ, magic or hakeem) who is as good at as many things on both ends of the floor, on and off ball, as LeBron James. He scores, passes, rebounds, defends bigs and guards, defends the paint, fast break defender, can be a potent spot up shooter, dunks, has a reliable jumper, post game, great at driving, good at anticipating passing lanes, can play point guard or point forward or small forward or power forward. his free throws need work though."

"Yeah....even the description of the book is hogwash  &gt;The power black athletes have today is as limited as when masters forced their slaves to race and fight. The primary difference is, today’s shackles are often the athletes’ own making.  So you're telling me that LeBron James, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, etc have as limited power as slaves did? Holy disillusion. "
Kevin Durant and LeBron James. 
"I never said Pelinka doesn't know what he's doing. I said it's a lot to expect of a brand new GM to completely overhaul his roster to include nothing but veteran talent to compliment LeBron James and entice him to stay.  That last paragraph was what they call a reductio ad absurdem. You're being unrealistic and asking me to be realistic under those criteria.  The Cavs were LeBron's home town and had Kyrie. They also had two number one overall picks and the degree to which Bennett was a bust was not yet clear. The Lakers have a similar situation without the bona fide star and without the home town benefit.  I understand how salary matching works. Clarkson's $11.5M doesn't match up with any *great* veterans and can only be traded once. Deng's salary works for matching, but is undesirable and is unlikely to return a quality veteran. They've got KCP and Lopez, but those players are only under contract this year so the moves would have to be made now in anticipation of LeBron coming and would change the cap space calculations.   But sure, I'm being foolish. I should anticipate that Pelinka will entirely overhaul the roster of the team that currently holds the worst record in the NBA into a roster that can compete for a title if LeBron and PG come."
LeBron James and nothing less
"&gt; To be fair, they definitely have more allure than a team like Toronto or Charlotte.   Oh no doubt. I don't blame the Lakers for having that mentality -- they can draw talent for any of many reasons, and planning with that in mind *within reason* makes sense. But in the current landscape, being The Lakers isn't going to get you LeBron James or really any superstar player.   Your last sentence is moreso what I was getting at with my post. When you're one of the worst teams (can we call this a reverse dynasty?) ever over the last 5 seasons, as this article points out, putting your young talent like Nance/Randle/Clarkson on the block as has been reported to clear space for a star who is not guaranteed to sign with you sounds crazy (to me). Those 3 have been big pieces in getting a solid young core together, and there's probably still another step to be taken to get to the moderate level of success you'd need to attract a top guy. Said star would come in and still need a lot of help added to that roster, especially seeing as the team is in the West. I'm just wary of selling members of your young core at the deadline with the hopes a top FA joins your squad in the summer. "

"I mean, in theory, if Lebron says ""I'm leaving, I'd prefer to be traded to Houston to play with my buddies,"" it would be a good look for the Cavs to bend over backwards to make that possible. ""Lebron James is a hometown hero who led us to a championship against all odds, we're sad to see him go, but we respect his choice to move on, and we want to give him the best possible chance to win..."" In the same sense that the Player's Tribune article was a huge step towards LeBron redeeming himself for The Decision, it would be a huge PR blow for the Cavs to redeem themselves for acting like bitches when he left in the first place. Makes the organization look much better, and increases the chances of free agents considering Cleveland, and future stars are less likely to want out in the first place. Of course, that's not going to happen. Lebron's going to finish his career in Cleveland. "

"&gt;lol if Harden was the best iso scorer in the league, he wouldn't have brutally choked against the Warriors in 2015 or against the Spurs last year. And Durant balled out the last game against the Warriors.  Durant choking is why he had to join a championship team to win a championship. This is a joke. He's literally the face of choking in big games in the NBA.  &gt;Are you kidding? You would rather have Reggie Jackson who had a 52.7 TS% that year and Serge Ibaka than Clint Capela, Aaron Gordon, and Patrick Beverly? You have to be trolling.  Those guys are nothing, they only get wide open shots off of harden's ability to create shots. Durant can't create anything for his teammates thats why they have low shooting percentages. He cannot make plays for teammates to save his life.  &gt;LeBron James in the playoffs: 28.4 PPG, 57.4 TS% Kevin Durant in the playoffs: 28.8 PPG, 58.8% TS  In elimination games/games facing elimination Durant's counting numbers and efficiency numbers go waay down compared to Lebrun's which goes back to my point about Durant consistently coming up short when it matters the most. That is until he gets on a 72 win championship contender team."
add LeBron James
LeBron James has a +/- problem
"LeBron being LeBron James + teaming up with all stars in the East has resulted in 7 straight finals  It's not just an overreliance on LeBron, it's the fact that he won't conform to anyone while everyone has to change their game to fit him. This didn't change Wade/Kyrie a ton but Bosh/Love completely changed their games to play with LeBron. Meanwhile for example KD hasn't changed much offensively with GS because Steph has been willing to sacrifices touches to integrate KD, something LeBron has shown he is unwilling to do. Playing with LeBron means that he has control over your touches, contract, media image, and more. Most players are happy to make these sacrifices because he also gives them the best chance at a ring. But you can't just stick LeBron with any star and make it work because he will never accomodate."

"Players have been hearing all season about how they're going to be traded so there can be room for 2, possibly 3 if the math ends up working out, max superstars. They're clearly unhappy about that. Then you have Magic and Pelinka who are really low key excited for Free Agency because they believe they can do it.   But then you have the reality. Reality is we're going to trade 3 talented players who could have a future here for the CHANCE at signing LeBron James, Paul George, DeMarcus Cousins, Michael Jordan, John Stockton, etc, etc, etc.   Have you seen the movie Nightcrawler with Jake Gyllenhaal? There's a line in the beginning of the movie where Louis Bloom (Jake's character) is talking to someone he's trying to barter with. He says, ""My motto is, if you want to win the lottery, you have to have the money to buy a ticket."" and that's what the Lakers are doing. They're going to sell off all these good young pieces to have the money to buy a ticket to the lottery of which they have almost no chance of winning.   Unlike Louis Bloom, they won't end up scheming their way to the top through their sociopathic, do-whatever-it-takes attitude. They'll lose and be left with Zo, Ingram and Zubac as their core as they work another half decade on trying to get good. As long as the Laker brand is strong with fans, the executives on this team will continue to sell bullshit Laker exceptionalism which doesn't exist."

"It was the right trade at the time.  They needed a Point Guard and, absent Prime LeBron James, they might have a ring or two to show for it."
That's my point. Booker is a better shooter from outside which is what James loves to have.  I think he would be much better than he is now as well with someone like Lebron commanding attention.

Skip's room probably looks like a bowl of calm chowder without the clams.  As for the worst Lebron game I can think of off the top of my head was that one Pacers game where he scored like only 7 points (in playoffs too). [I remember it clearly because his son game him shit about it afterwards.](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2087890-lebron-james-son-wasnt-impressed-with-his-game-5-stats-in-conference-finals)

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

LeBron James.
"he's at 53% TS for his career and is at a career worst 50% this year. That's well below average, and it's absolutely atrocious for someone on his usage.  field goal percentage is the single most useless stat in the game, possibly in all of sports. It doesn't differentiate between 2s and 3s and doesn't account for trips to the line, all of which are relevant when looking at how a player scores points and all of which are not things he does consistently well.  And I said ""stopped"" w/r/t free throws because his decline to a 62% shooter this year is pretty sudden but, at this stage in the season, not a mere statistical anomaly.   More importantly he barely plays defense, doesn't pass, and is a poor rebounder for his position. I've written [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7nx0gg/what_happened_to_andrew_wiggins_that_he_went_from/ds5egog/) about the basketball stuff he's bad at, without the stats bit, but we're on year four of him being one of the worst advanced stats players in the league. Either models that love LeBron James and Steph Curry and hate Kyle Singler is somehow wildly yet consistently wrong four straight times, or there's something about his play that's worth a second opinion.  you're talking about the single worst player in the league who plays less than 10 minutes a game, a guy who last played meaningful NBA minutes when Obama was president, and another guy who I'm pretty sure did the remix to Ignition. If you think Singler is bad, fine, but he plays 7 minutes a game and thus does limited lasting damage to his team. Wiggins plays ~40 minutes a game of no defense, poor shot selection, and zero ball movement. you can weigh those two how you want, but I'd rather take the awful NBA player who barely plays rather than the merely pretty bad one who leads the league in minutes."
Lebron James got son'd 
LeBron James -39
this is a post pertaining to LeBron James in his 15 seasons. Stop turning into a Celtics/Lakers/Lonzo conversation
Lebron James with a +/- of -39  Huh...
"Well we've had the longest playoff streak in the east before this year, so it's not like weve been bad forever.   But the problem is that we weren't really going to win a championship with our old team construction, mostly because we haven't had a real true star on the hawks since Nique and if you're gonna win a championship in this league, you need a real true super star.   Here's where why we're doing so shitty comes into play, the best way to get that superstar on your team is by getting a high draft pick. Since we've been in the playoffs for literally the last decade we haven't been able to get one, this year we decided to change that.  There's a reason why we're deciding to just drop the longest playoff streak in the Eastern conference, the NBA is in a very peculiar place right now. We're in between generations of great players and one of the best (arguably the best) players of all time (LeBron James) is getting older and his Dynasty on this side of the conferences is going to soon end. That's going to create a power vaccume the likes haven't been seen since MJ fell off the wagon.   The best chance in the last two decades to get an NBA championship is coming up soon, and we're trying to be ready for that by securing a generational talent (that we would have  a fraction of a percent of a chance to get otherwise) in one of the best top end draft classes since 09, possibly 03. Making the playoffs and having a winning basketball team is awesome, but as I'm sure you know, this city needs a championship. And we're gonna do our damndest to bring it one.   There are also other factors like this being the last year to truely be able to ""tank"" for a top pick because of league reforms and such, but this is the main reason why"
LeBron James : Cleveland :: Aaron Rodgers : Green Bay
"Lol, you think LeBron James is gonna continue scoring 10 points in games?"
"James Harden, despite his injury, can still very much beat LBJ for the MVP.  LeBron has some nice stats but his performances against good teams are going to bite him in the ass. "
I believe LeBron James' worst ever plus/minus in a game is -34. Tonight at Minnesota he's -39. Records are incomplete but I'd say it's a fair bet this is the worst he's been outscored in his life.
TIL. Lebron James is capable of having bad games
"At my first NBA game since I was a little kid. It's so disrespectful towards the paying fans to not have LeBron James show up at all today. This benching stars for the entire game stuff is bullshit.  Edit: downvotes? Damn, tough crowd. "
"This trade basically gets that at $13M salary next season. They could then feasibly add 3 $30M contracts to the books under the salary cap. From there, they can use their exception and vet mins to round out their team.  I wonder too if instead of future 1sts, the 76ers send back some of their less valuable rookies, like Holmes, Korkmaz, Anderson, McConnell, or TLC. Might be more valuable for the Lakers.  Lets say that everything falls right for them, they could potentially have a roster of:  - Lonzo Ball, TJ McConnell  - JJ Redick, Anderson, Josh Hart  - Paul George, Kyle Kuzma  - Lebron James, Larry Nance  - DeMarcus Cousins, Richaun Holmes, Zubac"

"Dude look at your previous posts,   &gt; Celtics jizzed on the Cavs with that trade.  &gt; It's kind of depressing that mediocre/bad players all get career highs against the Cavs.  &gt; Maybe Lebron should play some defense then.  &gt; I'm sorry, but Lebron James is the GOAT flopper to me. When he flopped on his own teammate to result in a technical foul for the opposing team, I just knew he was the GOAT flopper. No one had ever thought about flopping on their own teammate before, until Lebron came along. He revolutionized the art of flopping.  You're a douche lol"
"Top 10 but I don’t know if it’s the GOAT. Dope Island was just on another level of hilarious with his vines, and we can’t forget about Lenarr and the piano. But tbh I gotta go with LeBron James lmao. That was just iconic on so many levels"
Lebron the big Jeff green James. 
He didn't dominate the era of LeBron James or the Spurs.  The Spurs and Lakers co-dominated the 2000's and 2010's have been the LeBron and Warriors era.
Yeah that should do it. He dominated in the era of the Spurs and Lebron James which helps.
"It's not an oversight in the data though. Go look at the number of 3s they all attempted and what their FT% was ([link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kobe+Bryant&amp;player_id1_select=Kobe+Bryant&amp;y1=1997&amp;player_id1=bryanko01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Dwyane+Wade&amp;player_id2_select=Dwyane+Wade&amp;y2=2004&amp;player_id2=wadedw01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id3_select=LeBron+James&amp;y3=2004&amp;player_id3=jamesle01&amp;idx=players)) and it classes them out of the criteria the OP is looking at. Kobe attempted 136 3's his rookie year, LeBron attempted 217, and Wade attempted 53. And their free throw percentages were: Kobe - 81%, LeBron - 75%, Wade - 74%.   Going by what the OP is suggesting these guys you all listed, while they did do a lot of slashing, could all still shoot it competently. They could shoot it well enough to have the confidence to take 3s in the flow of the offense (rather than just heaving it as the clock is expiring the way Simmons does). These guys may have improved their shot as their careers went along, but they still had a somewhat reliable shot when they came in the league. This is not the case for Simmons, who will have to try to craft one out of nowhere if he's to ever become a shooter of any kind."
"Honestly, they were both coming off low points in the season.   Lue is always going to be discredited because he has Lebron James. It's nothing against race but history has shown Lebron's coach never really gets their due. It's either Lebron lead the team or the coach failed. It's not the most glamorous job.   Onto Casey, he was seen as a coach who had to reinvent or he was stuck in his ways. He was on the hot seat to start the season because of it and guess what? He adapted. Mind you I can't speak for that in the playoffs but during the regular season you saw a different Raps play style than 2016/17  Onto another head coach you left out in Nate McMillan for the Pacers. He was also underrated because his last NBA stint wasn't that great. Obviously journalists aren't going to hype him when he wasn't doing well before. Guess what? He turned it around as well and had Indiana within a game of round 2.   Doc Rivers is also a minority coach who is somewhat overrated imo but I don't see you complaining about him  There is no racial bias against coaches, the media will only look at their body of work and sometimes that even boils down to ""what have they done lately"". There are racial issues in sports but outside of fan bias, everyone in this sub is respectful of race from what I've been apart of "

I’m a Lebron fan. I did used to go for the Warriors until they got good. Now theyre just in Lebrons way so i dont like them obviously. I will one day again but not while lebron is in the league. I have jerseys and all that put away in my closet. Wont be wearing any of that for a while tho. But yeah Lebron fan. No one in my family knew about basketball (they suddenly all love it now 🙄) so i just had to figure it out myself. There was this dominant guy named Lebron James and i’ve been following him ever since. With all that being said i cant wait for the new stadium to open up downtown here.

"&gt;Not sure why you are being downvoted.   LeBron James had a good game more recently.  I think LeBron's a better overall player, but claiming he's the indisputable playoff GOAT over Jordan is idiotic.   If we're talking basketball ability, his finals record doesn't matter. If we're talking playoff performance, it does. LeBron isn't even #2 in playoffs. "

"I think this is extremely dissapointing for the Raptors for a few reasons.   1. That game 2 was an absolute MUST WIN. I thought game 1 was a must win, but I figured, hey, if they win game 2, they're in this heading back to Cleveland. Now they're in a position where they're in a place that's going to be roaring, and a place where they've had big leads in the regular season but blew them. A place where the Cavs beat them without five rotation players, and a place they haven't won a playoff game. A place where Lebron is 28-1 against them. And at best they can maybe ask to head back to Toronto down 3-1 if they don't get swept.   2. That game 2 might have been the most important game in their franchise's history. But they didn't take it. Instead, they got blown out by both allowing Lebron's help to show up when everyone said that Kevin Love was done for, and that Jeff Green wouldn't have another game like game 1. And then Lebron had one of his all-time great playoff performances. So yeah, when that happens, there's not much you can do.   3. Raptors allowed Kevin Love to come out of his coma. The last thing the Raptors needed heading into Cleveland was a confidence boost for KLove. Now he knows he's got it and can bang in the post if a guy like Miles is on him. He also took serious advantage of Valenciunas' struggles on the defensive end, pump faking him and forcing him to make decisions on the perimeter about closeouts/driving lanes the cavs could use.   4. Lastly, the Raptors were the favorites coming into this series. Make no mistake, they SHOULD win this series. It's what the expectations were for them. All time great in Lebron James or not, this is a team sport, and the Raptors have the overwhelmingly better team. But to lose HCA completely being a team that won damn near 60 games in the regular season and now you're down 0-2 heading back to Ohio? Unacceptable.   5. Shot in the heart - I'll admit, I thought the ""Raptors choke artists"" and ""mental chokehold"" narrative was overplayed and that the Raptors were never really favored against Cleveland in the past so they could be excused a bit. Well, it's looking to be pretty true now. They're favored significantly and it seems that they will struggle to even win a game this series. They lost in perhaps the worst way possible by choking a million free opportunities at the end of game 1, then got just run out of the gym after the first half in game 2, and Lebron just toyed with them with the fadeaways. if you look at the bench when he was hitting some of those fadeaways, the demoralization there and in the Air Canada Centre were palpable. Lebron toys with you in your gym, and now you go back to his home court? Yeah, not good.   They ain't dead yet but it's hard for me to see them winning a game at this point, considering the mental domination the Cavs have on the Raptors. Or namely, Lebron. "

More like Raptors have no answer for LeBron James. Pacers should've went in for the jugular because I don't want to see any more of him in the Finals. Toronto is too shitty in the playoffs to even have a chance. Boston's my only hope and they don't have two of their best players.
I think LeBron James is running circles around Dwane Casey 
"Ugh, the revisionism among sixers fans has gotten out of hand. Do you guys actually remember LeBron James year 1?   No, he didn't have a seizure every time he found himself 10 feet to the basket. Also, his finishing at the rim was (and still is) light years ahead of everybody else. He was the freakiest of the freaks, seriously a terrifying 18 year old. Never seen before.   Ben Simmons is very good. He's tall, he handles the ball well, can dunk, can pass, is a pretty good defender (though way overrated imo) and can switch pretty well.   He can't finish that well in half-court, can't shoot to save his life, is super uber dependent on his teammates making shots and...lacks intensity? He's also a huge bitch but that's a rant for another day.   All I'm trying to say is you all need to chill with the LeBron talk. LeBron is not human, seriously, he's not. Ben is closer to a freakish Rondo than he is to LeBron at this point.   Finally, fuck the process. "
"&gt; But you gotta remember your rival is Lebron fucking James. Calling it a choke is not really relevant.   Yup, the Knicks lost to MJ's Bulls four times in five years, before they beat them with a Jordanless team the sixth year. Even if the Raptors are a higher seed, LeBron is still expected to win like the Bulls were. The Knicks ""choked"" against the Bulls as much as the Raptors have against LeBron."

"Yeah but the media gains from promoting James, because his games are televised and they need ratings because TV is imploding in on itself due to people ditching it for stream services, video games and social media.   There is money in presenting James as ""GOAT"", which is what his fans dont quite understand, they really think its a legitimate discussion and how every time LeBron beats a average East team, it somehow proves he is on the same level.   There is no money in pimping Jordan, if anything it makes this entire league look worse by comparison and we cant have that."
"I think LeBron James is on the same tier as MJ when it comes to overall basketball skill. Defense alone, MJ gets the nod from me. "
Decent isn’t good enough to take Lebron James to 7 games. We absolutely believe the Pacers are decent. We’re just confused as to how they did something usually reserved for Golden State.
"But you are talking about LeBron James. As much as Simmons reminds us all of him, it's pretty clear to anyone watching that he is not on the same level, especially athletically. Go watch 21 year old LeBron highlights, he was unfair back then.  Ben has a chance to improve, definitely. As other have said, a lot of resources and time will be poured into developing him. But let's not just expect him to improve because the arguable GOAT did it."
"I thought we actually stood a decent chance of winning before the series started (50/50), but deep down I was always scared that Cavs not named LeBron James would come to life and my fears came true "

"I did read what you said. You brushed it off as one game, which is fair, but then immediately criticized a single Donovan Mitchell performance.  I don't really think Don got bailed out last game. He found other ways to contribute to the win and the team was better with him on the floor than off it.  Celtics fans were excited to see Simmons checking back into the game last night. For a guy who has been touted as the ""second coming of LeBron James"", the contrast in their performances last night stood out tremendously."

"A couple points to counter what you're saying.   1.lebron and simmons will be staggered for most of the game. This will allow them to have a point forward running the offense for 100% of the game similar to Houston. There are diminishing returns as you mention but the one thing you're not accounting for is the simmons lebron pick and roll. Simmons as a roll man will be unstoppable driving to the rim and passing.   2. Love and bosh have suffered but this is over blown. Love suffers because he cannot do anything but score well and he's a much different player than he was in Minnesota. Injuries along with the game changing so much has rendered him much less effective. Bosh was very effective as a third option and defensive stalwart for the heat. He didn't get as many touches but was great in when he did. Embiid will still be a dpoy level player and can be an elite pick and roll lob threat for bron and simmons along with post ups sprinkled here and there.   Nobody knows what reddick will do. He might be willing to stay or not but he seems to really like this team. Either way they will find some other types of shooters.   3.simmons lebron and saric and Covington being the same size does not matter. 3 of those guys are elite defenders and almost all of them can switch on anybody, especially against the warriors. This is actually a big benefit for them because they are going to be insane defensively.   4. There will be a lot of roster reshuffling if lebron joins -- they're going to be making a lot of moves to suit the roster to bron and simmons strengths. The sixers have another top 10 pick this year or next year as well as fultz and saric as trade chips. They don't even have to trade simmons to get another star potentially.   5. Lebron James is still the best player in the league by a mile. I'm not saying warriors wouldn't be favorites, but if you're really saying a lebron James led team with 2 all nba players beside him (assuming simmons makes improvements by next season which he should) has no chance against the warriors your out of your mind."
"One big issue I have with this analysis is that it misrepresents ""doesn't shoot threes,"" as ""can't shoot threes,"" despite Simmons clearly falling into the former category. He's never boasted a perfect jumper or anything, and in fact I question what his peak for shooting will really be (probably something like 37% max), but he's got a jump shot and is perfectly capable of putting in work to continue improving it and extend his range to the point he is comfortable with taking threes. He doesn't need to make 40%+ to unlock new facets of the game with his jump shot, he just needs to shoot well enough to keep defenders honest and provide an extra three point threat (especially in crunch time).    No one should feel confident that he 100% will perfect his jumper and be a serviceable three point shooter, but a good portion of that development is effort and the other big portion is having a somewhat usable jump shot technique that can be fixed with the help of a shooting coach and time. Simmons seems to be in an acceptable place with regards to his shooting development, and I have seen nothing so far to suggest he will never be capable of unleashing a serviceable deep shot.   Also, another thing with your analysis... you say something like ""free throw shooting is the best indicator of shooting ability,"" which is true in a sense, but not nearly as applicable when comparing FT% to 3P% at the NBA level. The huge reason that comparison is a thing is that free throw shooting is the stat accumulated in college that has the largest correlation with NBA-career three point shooting. I'd venture to say at the NBA level the comparison becomes far less important because free throws can be such a mental game while a three point shot happens in rhythm and most guys who work hard at it once they reach the NBA can hit at a good clip from three even if they never completely get over their free throw shooting woes. Jaylen Brown and LeBron James are both decent examples of this... LeBron has a lot of seasons of subpar shooting, but he's also proven that he can be deadly from three over significant sample sizes and not really see much (if any) improvement on his free throws. "

They *are* the better team on paper and in reality, should be 2-0 against these Cavs. At this point, it's all mental now and because of that, I don't think they will ever get by LeBron so long as Lowry and DeRozan are their leaders. They are playing well in these playoffs,  but they just can't seem to close out a James-led team. They buckle under the pressure when their lead starts to fade."
"Let's be honest, the only guy truly putting in the hard work day-in and day-out without fail on either team is LeBron James. Everyone else is just coasting on pure talent and don't put in the tireless effort off the court - LeBron takes his talent and maximizes it."

The last time LeBron wasn't in the finals Steph Curry and james Harden (beardless) were rookies, Blake Griffin was the reigning number one overall pick,   the idea of Nash and Howard going to LA wasn't even a thing, Chris Kamen was an all star (after Brandon Roy was unable to play) and  Kyrie was still in high school  Not looking forward to when we do this 10 years from now and we say his kid was just starting elementary school"
"&gt;Lebron has never lost in the first round. Jordan got swept.  Who cares about the first round? A 3-5 Finals record is pathetic.  Also, Lebron has lost too many times as the favorite. MJ didn't lose once.  &gt; but those teams weren’t as good as the Spurs, or the Warriors.  The Jazz? Suns? The Sonics?  And Lebron was never as good as MJ.  &gt;He chose to walk away from his team.  But not to form a super team.  &gt;If he keeps this pace up for another 3-6 years, he’ll be the GOAT easily.  Maybe to the young generation who didn't get to see MJ. They don't know what it is like when players didn't form super teams when things got too hard.  If Lebron wanted to be the GOAT, then he shouldn't have bailed out on teams when he got slaughtered.  How can you tell me with a straight face that Lebron is on the path to be GOAT when he quits anytime things get too tough? Lebron is playing with the cheat codes on. Can't beat em? Then enter the cheat codes.  Lebron literally said the new Miami team would win 8 Championships. He formed that team with the idea that Championships would now be a cake walk. That's not greatness to me.  And the only reason MJ played for the Wizards was to help promote the team.  MJ also has done a lot of things to make him GOAT - 10 time scoring champion; played all 82 games a lot; many memorable moments (James has maybe a handful); Defensive Player of the Year; owns a ton of records; etc. etc. Lebron just doesn't have this kind of stuff."
I used to be a Lebron hater but after his performance in game 2 I've jumped ship in favor of Mr. LeBum James
LeBron James represents everything I hate about basketball.  He is my least favorite player of all time
"Lebron isn't just a scorer that's what you fail to understand. That is not how he plays, it's not the only way he affects games, it's not his mentality or style of play. Your failure to acknowledge that shows a minimal understanding for professional basketball and also Lebron James.   You are hiding behind ppg this is the type of discussions I had in recess on 6th grade when we analyzed players. Miami was inches away from winning Game 4 and Game 2. Lebron should have played better and done more but the way he was playing was working more often than not. They were in all the games and had a chance to win every one."
Magic Johnson \- Kobe Bryant \- Kevin Durant \- LeBron James \- Kareem   these guys will put up a challenge
"&gt; One of Jordan’s team was a super team for sure!  Jordan didn't quit the Bulls to join another team.  &gt;it’s better to be 3-5 in the FINALS than 0-0.  Lebron James took the easy way out and he's STILL only 3-5.  Imagine if a guy got destroyed on Madden, but was then able to put everyone's stats up to 99 but STILL went only 3-5 playing another person.  See how said that is?  &gt;A lot of players don’t get that opportunity.   Yeah but when most do, it's because they earned it through blood and sweat.  Lebron didn't earn it.  Kevin Durant didn't earn it."
&gt;  It's 2018 and people still think this way? LMFAOOOOOOOO  It's even worse. What Kevin Durant did was almost as bad as what Lebron James did.  Young people don't remember a time when players in the NBA wanted to compete. Now a days players take the easy way out when things don't go their way.  What Kevin Durant and Lebron James did was put in cheat codes because they couldn't win.
"I don't have all the answers out of my ass and I'm sure some of it is racism, but there are a lot of potential extra reasons.  A lot of black role models such as rappers, random celebrities, etc. are flaunting wealth through luxury clothes, shoes, expensive cars, jewelery, etc.   Bill Gates, Mark Fuckerberg, and honestly I'm having trouble of thinking of white cultural icons lol do not flaunt as much.  It creates a lot of psychological association with how you need x to be cool and then that will get reflected from your peers back to you and so on and so forth and creates a culture of financial irresponsibility.   Hopsin talks about some of this stuff often, ik he's hated by a lot of people, but you gotta treat him like a religion lol. Skim the surface and take out the useful stuff.  Which is why the NBA having Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and DeMar DeRozan will seriously help."
"&gt; Remind me again who won those FMVPs in 2012 and 2013  James robbed Wade of one in 2011 and 2013 should've never went to 7 games.  &gt;He’s the goat and Lebron won’t reach that because of 2011.   To me Lebron won't reach it because he quits on teams to form super teams too easily. I mean it's one thing to leave to another team, but it's another to leave to another team to form a super team in your prime."
Lebron James lol
"LeBron James absolutely believed he could beat the Raptors in the series, don’t be ridiculous. He probably didn’t expect to take game 1, but he’s won plenty of series after dropping the first game."
"Skip: Lebron james, can not get it done when the lights are brightest. AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT. he has failed, when he has to live up to the pressure. YOU KNOW IT AND I KNOW IT. in all my years of covering sports, I've never seen anything quite like THIS.   Shannon: but hairs tha thang skip. My grandma always told me, that racism would be the reason why LeBron was great, like we say in the 2016 finals.  Skip: The Cavaliers won that finals, only because of one AHMED SHUMPERT. He put the entire team on his back, and he said WATCH. THIS, and you know what *pointlessly straightens papers* they don't have a hope without him this time around. "
"Wade choked at the end of game 4 but people just put the blame on Lebron because he's the better player. If Lebron did this we'd never stop talking about it: https://youtu.be/YSf1OwbMWKg?t=18m34s  People care too much about the ppg of Wade and James and don't actually say what actually lost them that series. We just beat the Rockets with Donovan scoring 17 points on 28% FG. If Lebron had a coach like Quinn Snyder he would have won in 2011.  In Game 5 of that series Lebron had 17 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and a crucial block in transition. Wade was great offensively for most of the series and Bosh and Lebron chipped in with double digit scoring.  Lebron averaged his normal assists and rebounds in that series he just didn't shoot as much because the team wasn't built around him like it was in Cleveland it was built around Wade and consequently he scored less. Lebron wasn't the point guard like we often see him they had a point guard in Chalmers and the offense was built around Wade. Miami would have won that series if they got some key defensive stops in the 4th quarter of some of those games.  "
"What kinda logic is this? So because Terry Porter and Lebron James (who are on completely different ends of the talent spectrum) did it, Ben Simmons will also do it? While ignoring all these ""shitty NBA players""?"
"Nah.  Raptors aren't even playing awful, LeBron James is just.... who he is."
"He started in OGs place early in the season and struggled. Went down with an injury for a couple games and OG claimed his spot as the starter. The bench mob (VanVleet, Wright, Miles, Siakam, Poeltl) lineup was born and he fell out of the rotation. Then Lebron James owned us. The end. "
Lebron james is just something else..
"He was LeBron James in that Finals, he is now GOAT."
"Youre wrong. lebron has shown to be one of the best off ball players in the league from his time in miami. He let kyrie run the offense numerous times last season, so lebron could definitely let steph run it when need be. And yes, LeBron does change your offense. Its lebron motherfucking james. If you have LeBron and the two greatest shooters of all time on offense, and a dpoy and klay thompson on defense, you give lebron the ball every play on offense and he either gets a bucket or a pass to an open shooter. When he needs to rest, or take a break from driving, he can play off ball while steph does steph things. Meanwhile, KD cant lead a weak team. Hes shown this time and time again. The only time hes been successful in playoffs is when he had the superior team."
"&gt;I honestly think it's partially because of LeBron.  lebron had a jump shot, it was good but it wasnt anything reliable. If you go back and watch his first season [he was making 0.8 3's a game attempting 2.7, this year he was 1.8 from 5 per game so 29% to 36.7%](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/1966/lebron-james).... but the thing is...  **Ben Simmons is averaging 0 3's a game and attempting 0.1 on average**  [Stats here](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907387/ben-simmons)  [and here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/simmobe01.html#all_per_game)  All year Ben Simmons has attempted 11 3's... **11**   [in Lebron's first year he attempted 217 and made 63...](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html)  Ben Simmons has no jump shot.. "
"Yeah but the issue becomes was it an actual loan or did someone give him the car because he's LeBron James, kicked an investigation that turned up nothing.  https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/14/sports/basketball-lebron-james-s-suv-prompts-an-investigation.html"
I was told I needed an education and shit when I could just go out and be LeBron James smh
"This is an interesting thing you could learn in life. When you get pushed down, you get the fuck back up and become Lebron James. Easy. No but seriously, it's interesting that he took that loss and got better."
"Coming from /r/all, can someone explain? I guess it has something to do with LeBron James and Toronto?"
"So I cam from /All, just wondering the context here. Guessing LeBronto refers to Lebron James, but are they just saying he is tall? Is there a backstory?"
Yeah because he's not the next LeBron James. Let's just slow our roll right there
"LeBron James plays for Cleveland, who are playing Toronto in the playoffs. LeBron's team has knocked them out of the playoffs two years in a row, and it's looking like they will do it again this year. Calling it ""LeBronto"" is basically saying that LeBron owns their team. "
Alright after tonight I have officially converted. LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time. I have never seen such a dad dicking in my life. 
"according to the first result on google, there are at least 1000 lebrons in the world, and none of them are as good as lebron james. so i would have to conclude that his name has no effect on his greatness, and that he would be just as good if his name was cornelius or something "
At what point do the Raptors call Lebron James their daddy?
Love got going because they played pick and roll basketball.  Lebron taking the ball and having everyone spread the floor is exactly the opposite of what the Cav's need to do.  They need to run pick and roll basketball basically every possession.  Lebron James is a mismatch for every damn player in the league.  It should be so easy for him to absolutely destroy playing pick and roll basketball because everything is a mismatch.
James Jones. We all know LeBron and James Jones are the same person...don't contradict it
The answer is Lebron James. 
Micheal Jordan has Lebron James posters in his room. 
Chuck: I GUARANTEEEE LEBRON JAMES WON'T LEAVE CLEVELAND.
"&gt; the hot-takes will always still be ""hey remember when they shat the bed to LeBron in that season when they weren't supposed to?""  Uh, probably not. The only things that still get talked about from 2011-2012 (in terms of how it negatively affects people's perceptions of players today that they haven't been able to shake) are LeBron shitting the bed in the Finals and James Harden having a bad Spurs series. Stuff fades. "
What if his name was James James?  Would we take James James as seriously as LeBron James?
nah goat means greatest to play the game. Thats the man right there Lebron James. 
No no.  LeBron James.
"Pacers have way more mismatches they can key in on. Thad Young and Sabonis were trapping Love forcing him to play inside or pass and half the time he'd turn it over and the other half he couldn't hit a shot. Oladipo is an absolute nightmare because he's faster than literally everyone on the Cavs and he can finish at the rim OR shoot the 3 in transition. Not to mention the Bogdonavic game. He smoked em. The problem with Toronto is they have no idea how to stop Lebron. I mean no one does, but the Pacers have Lance at least, and they are just a machine that goes and goes and goes even if they're down 20. Toronto is none of that. Ball movement is only so good when you hit the shots, once they stop falling it reverts back to ISOs and corner 3s. It's every year with these Raptors, it's predictable and sad because they're such a dominant regular season team but they have this giant roadblock that is Lebron James. "
"See, there’s the issue. You can’t call something “undeniable” and then have it be easily deniable. I think Michael Jordan is a better basketball player than LeBron James. I just denied your claim. Is there any proof? No, and there never EVER will be. It’s called an opinion, they tend to differ. "
Newsflash: Ben Simmons and LeBron James are not the same player
"&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James is the first player in NBA Finals history to lead both teams in points, assists and rebounds for the entire series, according to ESPN.  &gt;James averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists across six Finals games.   This is stopping LeBron?"
Like LeBrondo? The future unbeatable tandem of LeBron James and Rondo?  
"Lebron ""Chicxulub"" James"
HOLY FUCK READ THE COMMENTS I DON'T THINK THE REFS LOST US THIS GAME I JUST THINK THAT IN GENERAL THE RAPS KNOW LESS ABOUT GETTING REF FAVOURITISM AND STAR CALLS THAN LEBRON JAMES *catching breath* and I agree we got spanked I've never been so frustrated with a team.

&gt;...The guy came from nothing and never got into one scandal despite being given instant fame and wealth overnight...  He did have some scandals towards the end of his High School career when he bought his Hummer.

you raptors fans cry like little bitches and make the most excuses out of all fans on reddit. the cherry on top? when your lil insecure asses cant take the heat ya start comparing out of the blue trying to poke fun at other peoples' teams. sorry ass fans. just accept the raptors best team in history will never get over the hump because their nuts shrivel at the very sight of lebron james.
"After the Raptors tried to re invent themselves in an effort to beat LeBron James and their fans were convinced this year would be different especially since everyone was shitting on the Cavs all year... Not only that, they lost a close 1 point game yesterday and convinced themselves that the Cavs wouldn't get this lucky again only to get completely blown out of the water.  I legit think some of the fans are on suicide watch especially reading their sub. Philly blowing that lead was terrible but all things considered for the Raptors, their lost was devastating. Read their post game sub, it's depressing as shit."
His only kryptonite is Lebron James at this point
"I mean it sucks... But you gotta remember your rival is Lebron fucking James. Calling it a choke is not really relevant. Were the Spurs ""choking"" against Kobe and Shaq in the early 2000's? Naw, they were dealing with one of the greatest forces of their day. They did finally vanquish the beast so keep that in mind when wallowing in your tears."
"I'll use basketball reference's SRS for this:   The Warriors/Rockets are nothing like what Jordan played against.  Combing through EVERY single series of his championship years, he was the underdog 0 times.  The closest it came was the 1993 Cleveland Cavaliers and 1993 Phoenix Suns.    Lebron James, on the other hand, has won 6 series as an underdog in playoff series, and has lost exactly once to the Dallas Mavericks) who smoked Kobe Bryant.  The other 4 losses were against teams that were far, far better than his (2007 spurs, 2014 spurs, 2015 warriors, 2017 warriors) - Coincidentally, all 4 of those teams were better than ANY team Jordan every faced at any point in any of his runs; the closest being the 97 Jazz.

"I have.  I'm lucky enough to have a job where I can listen to sports talk radio all day (Golic &amp; Wingo, Dan Patrick, Cowherd, and Doug Gotlieb is.my usual line-up).  I hear all sorts of arguments.  Cowherd is the one that states the more Finals the better, despite the losing, and that garbage eater Nick Wright will jump at the opportunity to get any ammunition to defend LeBron.  LeBron's greatness doesn't need defending.  Top 2, Top 3 greatest player of all time, but god damn, Nick Wright will suck the dick of LeBron James poster when given the chance"
LeBron is a walking economy aswell my guy  https://www.vox.com/2017/6/1/15724252/lebron-james-economic-impact-cleveland-miami LA is a tourist city they don't need Kobe but the city of LA did love and embrace Kobe but LeBron literally helps the economy to what ever city he goes to if thats not having influence and being an icon idk what is
How about:  1) Broken down 5’7” Isaiah “Brinks Truck” Thomas  2) 36 year old washed up Dwyane Wade  3) Grieving out of shape Jae Crowder  4) Pouting January Lebron James  5) Injured Kevin Love or Kardashian Curse TT
Playoff games played:    Karl Malone - 193   LeBron James - 228
"“OH MAMA, WHAT _________.”  “(Insert alma mater’s mascot) triple!”  Or “LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD TO HUMAN LIFE!”"
"&gt; we haven’t seen playoff Lebron play James Harden yet  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_NBA_Finals  That said, James Harden is significantly better than he was then and this team is built around Harden where as that team was built around Durant"
LeBron James
LeBron Raymore James James Edward Harden Kevin Wayne Durant 
LeBron Raymone James
" Dwayne Casey yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Kyle Lowry gave a look of pleasant surprise. Center Jonas Valanciunas yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before DeRozan hit the locker room door, LeBron James hugged him and said, “Y’all getting swept”. "
I bet LeBron James is pretty useful as well
"What, you don’t think chalmers is better than Hill? What about James jones, he’s just as good as JR. Plus they had ray Allen, even though his 3% had fallen off and wasn’t close to what Korver has been this year. They had Norris Cole, Chris Anderson, and Shane Battier. It was a beast of a team, and no way could a cavs team built to maximize lebron as well as any team he’s ever played with could possibly compare."
"Seriously, he shot better than LeBron ""best series ever"" James that finals. If you wanna say he played ""terrible"" series and use some trivia number as argument, at least there are so better choices."
I’m more impressed by Scarrence Terrence because I already know Lebron James is the best player on this planet lol
"Curry is a great playmaker, even for a starting NBA point guard, he is all around a solid decision maker and can make tough passes on a technical level  However, the *elite* designation, in my view, is reserved for the best of the best, guys that can impact the game on an insane level with their playmaking alone, that show us things we have never seen before and do that on a consistent basis.   Among current NBA players, I would only dare call Chris Paul, LeBron James, Nikola Jokic, John Wall and perhaps James Harden *elite playmakers*"
Yep definitely don’t need to show up against LeBron James in the finals no siree
"Rockets beat Cavs 117 to 113 on 11/9/17. Harden had 35, 11, and 13 with Chris Paul out. Rockets beat Cavs 120 to 88 on 2/3/18. Harden played 31 minutes, had 16, 6, and 9, and Paul only played 27 minutes, with 22, 8, and 11. Both scored more than Lebron James."
You’d be surprised. Here’s a post I’ve copied from Facebook by someone I know...in my mind he represents a common perspective that I disagree with (spoiler - he worships Kobe):  “ My top 10. 1.Jordan 6-0 1a. Kobe 5-7 2. Bill Russell 11 3. Kareem 6-9 4.Magic 5-8 5. Tim Duncan 5-6 6. Larry Bird 3-5  7. Shaquille O'Neal 4-6 8. LeBron James  3-8 9. Isaiah Thomas 2-3 10. Scottie 6-0 “
"If you've got lebron james, you rely on lebron james."
"In other words, if you took the current favorite for MVP off of his team, it would be a closer representation to replace him with a replacement-level player than with LeBron James."
"I think you’re right, if you remove the best player from the team and take into account the head coach, the ‘07 Cavs are the worst team in a finals.  He was older but at least Iverson had an effective Mutombo getting 12rbs, 2blks and 17pts in the finals with Larry Brown as head coach. James had Drew Gooden as the 2nd leading scorer in the finals and he was really terrible, Mike Brown is not a great coach.   When it’s all said and done LeBron will have done more with worse players and head coaches than any other player by a wide margin, no one has carried as hard as LeBron has."
"Ben and Jerrys LeBron James flavor: LeBron and James flavored ice cream swirled together with James dough, LeBron bits, and LeBron James CORE."
Um Lebron James is how. Lebron James in 2014 was really fucking good. 
"He isn't THAT bad, and he seems to be better in the post-season. He gets a lot of shit for relying on LeBron james too much, but I mean, what else are you gonna do when you have talent like that surrounded by lesser players. "
"People hold it against him that his system is LeBron James.  Well, what's he supposed to do?  LeBron plus shooters and a roll man has basically been established as an elite ""system"" in a variety of contexts--like, if GSW didn't exist, it would have been the dominant offensive system in the NBA over the past decade.  Should he instead try to shoehorn LeBron into something else?    I take bigger issue with some of his lineup choices, but to his credit he has moved away from Jeff Green and Jordan Clarkson pretty quickly after it initially looked like those were his guys.  I agree with those above who say he's an average to above-average coach.  His ideas seem to be generally correct (emphasis on running an elite offense through LeBron /Love/Hill with an understanding that improved offensive efficiency will help on the defensive end) and he seems exceptionally good at relating to players and managing egos in a high-pressure environment.  He's also pretty good at in-series tactical adjustments and ATOs.  He's not an innovator and he does not appear to be someone who gets the most out of less-talented or one-dimensional players."
"No you cant just throw bodies at a guy like Jordan because hed just pass to a wide open pippen, kukoc or Harper/Kerr.   Its why we dont see players double and triple teaming Lebron James every single play of a game. "

Every team in the East is one all star away from taking the East.  Just so happens that that all star is LeBron James.  
"I can almost guarantee if the Cavs make the Finals they won't get swept. I mean did the Warriors sweep the Pellies? Did the Rockets sweep the Wolves or Jazz? Nope. But both teams will sweep a far superior team in the Cavs than the Jazz,Pels, and Wolves? With LeBron James at his peak right now? "
"Pop should win it every year or be a candidate to.   The COY award is more like a ""Most Improved Coach"" or ""Exceeded Expectations Coach"" instead of actual ""Best Coach of the Year"" so coaches who are known to be great get passed over all the time.   Similar to how Lebron James doesn't get as many MVPs as he deserves. "
Wrong again friend! LeBron James is in fact not my father
"I know how tall he is I'm saying that calling him a ""high IQ IT"" is a terrible comparison.  That's like equating Lebron James physique to that of Kirk Hinrich"
The problem is not as difficult as people think: this raptor team has no one as good as LeBron James 
"OK.  This is so wrong for so many reasons.    Let’s start with 07-08.  I’m only going with the playoffs here.    07-08 clutch time stats for Kobe in playoffs : 51 points on 48% shooting, 4-11 in last minute of games.  07-08 clutch time stats for James:  21 points on 26% shooting, 1-10 last minute   Clear winner there:  Kobe   In 08-09, seven players were more clutch than LeBron James in the playoffs.   While LeBron was very efficient in the clutch that year, his 31 points on 53% shooting (3-8 on final minute buckets) is surpassed by Ben Gordon (44 points, 5-10 on threes, 5-12 last minute), Paul Pierce (47 points, 5-12 last minute), Pau Gasol (35 points, 11-13 FG, 5-5 last minute and several other players.    09-10  Oh boy, was LeBron ever clutch this postseason? He scored 16 clutch time points.   Kobe Bryant scored 47.  Yes, Kobe played 23 games and LeBron only played 11.   But Kobe went on to lead his team to overcoming a 3-2 deficit against the Celtics in the Finals, the team that soundly defeated LeBron in the Eastern semifinals.  The team with Pierce, Garnett, Ray Allen and Rajon Rondo.  But LeBron had zero help, so just getting that far is a huge credit to him. Just not his ability in the clutch in a year you claim he was clutch god.  2007 is the only thing you got right.    LeBron was insane in the 2007 playoffs looking at crunch time numbers.  He also was able to rack those up fairly easy considering how much garbage time he got against lesser teams and in the Finals as they got swept.  In the conference finals, LeBron only led his (pretty shitty) team in scoring four times, getting outscored by Zydrunas Ilgauskas and even Daniel Gibson, who would lead the Cavs in points again in a game against the Spurs.  Larry Hughes even had three games as the Cavs leading scorer in those playoffs.   The reason for those 2007 numbers is exactly where the criticism started about LeBron being gunshy and deferring in the clutch.  Instead of doubling James on the drive, teams took to denying the kick out on James’ drives and switching up pick and roll defense to throw him off and he reacted by getting skiddish and taking the open jumpers that teams could let him have and still win. p  And while it was still incredible he dragged that sack of shit team to the Finals, it shows you’re full of shit and just pulling seasons out of your ass retroactively applying his newfound clutch to a time when he was anything but.    "
 Never thought LeBron James would had insane performance in this off season.
Lebron james
Lebron James being on the paper makes the Cavs better on paper. He's such a fucking mismatch it's insane. Absolutely no way to stop him that's the Raptors problem their defense on Lebron. 
He’s a poor mans LeBron James And even then that poor man would be pretty damn wealthy.   He does everything on the court and orchestrates that warriors offense. He just isn’t as good offensively and maybe a bit less court vision but he makes that teams offense run. 
Ah refreshing to see “A first player ever to....” that doesn’t finish with LeBron James at the end.
A core of LeBron and James
"1) You cannot prove that claim true or false. I challenged you to do so and you haven't. It *specifically* states values claims, such as the best anything, are ALL SUBJECTIVE 2) They specifically gave they Venus Williams example which is pretty much directly analagous to the LeBron James thing. It's a value claim. All value claims are subjective. They even list  ""best"" and ""better""  under their common subjective claim terms. https://youtu.be/Xph0q90M3do"
"I don't care if he might not be the best fit for it but I guarantee nobody wants to take down the Warriors more than Russ (and LeBron to an extent but he's already done it as least)  **Russell Westbrook**  **Paul George**  **Kawhi Leonard**  **LeBron James**  **Anthony Davis**  I think the best way to beat the Warriors is by being *really long* and forcing them into turnovers and making them uncomfortable, and being switchable, very very switchable  If you want a team that would work with Salary Cap then I'll try (I'm still putting Russ in cos I feel like it)  **Russell Westbrook**  **Josh Richardson**  **Kawhi Leonard**  **LeBron James**  **Clint Capela**"
It sucks.  In any other time period this Pelicans team is REALLY good but what does it matter when you have Lebron James on one side and the Warriors on the other?

"No they aren't. Lebron James plus 4 shooters that can play mediocre defense is better than them. Then add Tristan Thompsons revival, the shooters shooting lights out, and Love playing like an all-star, the cavs are better. It might be mostly because of one guy, but that one guy is arguably the greatest player of all time."

"It's funny, but I understand it:  * Nobody in the league is going to outscore Steph efficency-wise. Not Russ, not Lillard, not Kyrie.  * You need somebody who can at least make things difficult for Steph on defense. You can't have a sieve out there that will give up any points they score on offense right back to the Warriors on defense.  * Somebody who will hit threes, and stay the hell out of the way of LeBron and Harden and not waste possessions with stupid, inefficient shots early in the possession.  Hill makes a ton of sense in a team-building way. I would've leaned Beverly if you're pairing Harden and James, but Hill is fine."

Jesus Walks - LeBron James
"Just looked it up:  Larry Hughes, Ilguaskas, Drew Gooden, Eric Snow, LeBron James, Donyell Marshall, Damon Jones, Ira Newble, Scot Pollard, Sasha Pavlovic, David Wesley, Shannon Brown, Anderson Varejao, Dwayne Jones, and Daniel Gibson  And, that's in order of salary.  You're right, I modify my statement to worst Cavs team since he came back."
"I mean he's not wrong tho. He didn't say if anyone can beat Cleveland. He said ""if anyone can contain Lebron"".   With Kyrie and Hayward, Boston was supposed to be a contending team. So it makes sense a lot of their gameplan is built around beating Lebron's Cavaliers. We don't have the scoring punch anymore, but we do still have the defensive pieces designed to contain Lebron.  For the role of stopping Lebron, Boston has:  * **Al Horford** - Who has really stepped up as a Point-Forward defender. Giannis was -10 in the 4 games Horford defended him (before Horf went to defend Thon), Simmons is -50 in 4 games primarily defended by Horford (although Horford occasionally switches onto Embiid). A big part of Horford's defensive jump this year has actually come from his ability to defend Forwards (which he wasn't able to do playing C last year).  * **Marcus Morris** - Who held last year's mantle of being *The Lebron Stopper* (kind of a BS title tbh) holding the king to just 21.5 ppg over 4 games. Although Lebron can't really be stopped, Morris should at least be valuable in slowing him down.  * **Semi Ojeleye** - Who just defended Giannis better than anyone has all year. He held Giannis to 15FGA and 23 points over a 3 game stretch. As a rookie, he will struggle with Lebron's passing vision and experience, but he absorbs contact better than just about anyone in the league, also very quick laterally.  * **Jaylen Brown** - Similar body type to Jimmy Butler, is sniffing 2nd team all-defence and has played well on Lebron in the past.  * **Aron Baynes** - Can't guard Lebron 1v1, but he is one of the best interior defenders in the league when it comes to making you earn buckets on a drive. Doesn't get many blocks but is insanely willing to use his body to take hits if it means the opposition player is getting worn down.   * **Marcus Smart** - One of the strongest point guards in the league, very switch-friendly. Will take away a lot of the advantage Lebron has when he switches onto guards.  * **The best 3PT defence in the league** - This is incredibly valuable in being able to contain pass-first players such as Lebron/Simmons as they no longer have the bailout options they expect.   &amp;nbsp;  Boston can very easily run a lineup of:  Smart / Brown / Morris / Horford / Baynes  This is the strongest and most physical defensive lineup in the league. There really isn't an option for Lebron to get an easy bucket. There really isn't a great weak link that he can exploit.  ***    This could very easily be for nothing. Lebron is Lebron. That being said, there's no doubt Boston is at least better equipped than anyone else to contain the King.   Even when GSW were playing CLE in the last finals, they weren't able to stop him at all, [they just went shot for shot with him and dominated when he was on the bench](https://twitter.com/MichaelVPina/status/872663021247762432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxsports.com.au%2Fbasketball%2Fnba%2Flebron-james-plusminus-tells-the-whole-story-of-the-cavaliers-game-3-loss-in-the-nba-finals%2Fnews-story%2Fc083dea6fb6a8fdcc3cb629ef47ac1f5&amp;tfw_site=foxsportsaus). Lebron averaged 33 points on 56% shooting.  Boston is the last team left with a chance of holding the king under 30ppg. If Boston can't stop him then no-one can. "
"  Your source says that ""In contrast to objective claims, subjective claims cannot be proved true or false by any generally accepted criteria."" The athlete of the decade is an impossibly objective argument cause there are a million different criteria you could use to compare athletes of different sports each criteria could have a different ""winner"" Asking if LeBron James is objectively a better basketball player than me, certain feels like we have some ""generally accepted criteria.""

Draymond Green shooting like Lebron James now!
This is very easy to prove with a simple test:  Is Chris Paul LeBron? No  Is LeBron James LeBron? Yes  Therefore LeBron James &gt; Chris Paul 
"His numbers will go down because he'll be more of a spot up shooter again, and defensive specialist next to Lebron James...."
Those two reasons are bringing out the nephew in you my cleveland fr- ohp he has a Lebron James flair nvm. Im guessing you're Nick Wright then. 
"Of all the guys to accuse of PEDs with no evidence... you don't even choose big guys like  (THESE GUYS DO FUCKIN NOT TAKE PEDs AS FAR AS WE KNOW I AM NOT SAYIN THAT)  - Jae Crowder  - Dwight Howard  - LeBron James  - Ron Artest  - Karl Malone (actually maybe him)  You chose Stephen Curry? The guy known for being smaller? Who doesn't build his game on strength? With no evidence?  Forget Performance Enhancing Drugs, what Mental Performance Inhibiting Drugs are you on?"
I was thinking about what the perfect lineup around LeBron would be... Really good 3pt shooting and floor spacing with some players that can get their own shot if need be and defend on the other end.  Something like this:  1. Steph Curry - Greatest shooter in history and can get his own shot  2: Klay Thompson - Top 5 shooter in history and great defender  3: Kevin Durant - 38.4 career 3pt% really good defender on D  4: LeBron James   5: Draymond Green - former DPOY 32.7 career 3pt% and adds tenacity  Now if only there was some way for them to all be on one team... hmm 
LeBron James became an offical paleontologist!
"You're right, I was mis-remembering that part of the article. Probably got it mixed up with something else.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2017/05/17/wait-him-out-or-build-a-contender-lebron-james-presents-a-quandary-to-other-east-teams/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3011e0ec9005 "
LeBron James Harden
Anthony Davis is the best player in the NBA not named LeBron James don’t @ me
"Lmao Draymond ""Lebron James"" Green"
"I am a Rockets fan and I am a Lebron James fan, but I’m not a fan of Lebron James on the Rockets. "
The dude is just trying to point out that CP3 is balling out at age 33. the only other player in the league who is balling out at a star level at 33 or over is Lebron James. Who else is he supposed to compare him to lol? 
"I took am skeptical about the rush to put James over Jordan but I read an article some years back that claimed that LeBron's dominance had altered the nature of the Eastern Conference, forcing stars to go west and teams to try and wait for LeBron to decline before they build a team. Can't find the article."
"&gt; Maybe one day your team will somehow be lucky enough to win a ring   I don't hate the Raptors at all but man their fans are cocky as fuck for being fans of a team that can't do shit. Saying dumb shit like fuck the Warrior for building a great team mostly through the draft. Go be mad at Cleveland for falling ass backwards into LeBron James, 3 #1 picks and 2 #4 picks despite their best efforts to fuck it up."
"Problem is somewhat that this proves that having deep teams that win regular season games with a dominant bench don't always translate to the playoffs when opposing teams play their starters almost the entire game.  The Raptors bench is fantastic but if you look at the roster as a whole, they can't really stand toe-to-toe against some of the better lineups out there.  They won a lot of games because their bench totally blew other benches out of the water. But that is less meaningful when they have to go up against 41 minutes of LeBron James.  Ultimately, I think Ujiri has to be responsible for assembling the roster. Casey found a way to win games with it, but that doesn't mean it was built to compete in the playoffs. I'd say the same could be said for Stotts and the Blazers."
If you're signing anyone currently in the NBA a deal for that much money to play for you until they are 38 and his name isn't Lebron James you're crazy.  It depends if you are building around winning it all now or for a short term future though.
"Except it's true lmao, also lebron is deservedly this subs golden boy he's Lebron fucking James the fuck."
I know man. Lebron James and Kyrie Irving gave me PTSD. I won't believe it till I see it.
"Usually when I mention those two it's ""Wow did LeBron ever screw those big guys over. At least they got rings out of it."" Hope Kev can rebound once he's not on King James' court."
My favorite part - it was executive produced by LeBron James.  
"LeBron won that title. For the Finals, LeBron led both teams in all categories: scoring, rebounding, assists, blocks, steals. Kyrie helped, Kevin helped, Tristan, JR, hell that annoying white dude helped. But the straw stirring that drink was LeBron James playing the basketball as good as it had ever been played."
&gt;  I’m kinda tired of watching LeBron James trying to singlehandedly take down four all-stars  5 games really tired you out lol
Lance Stephenson is to LeBron James as Draymond Green is to everyone in the league.
"Every big, clutch play at the end of the game?  Ty Lue set that up and Lebron James executed."
"Yeah, hes been off. Its a team sport. Lebron is more consistent, the most consistent superstar. But he had one bad game and his team still won that.    James has been off for a few games now."
Do you think ~~LeBron James~~ Donovan Mitchell would still be the best player in the league if he had to wear sandals every game?
LeBron James to Utah confirmed.
He thoroughly whooped LeBron's ass and outplayed him last year and people didn't care. Apparently playoffs only matter for LeBron James and not for any other player.
They said James was the MVP. I told em to call him by is first name. Lebron.
"James Harden is not the MVP. If there was a title for “best stat padder” or “most ISO’s called” then he can have it. But if you tell me he is more valuable to his team than LeBron James, I’ll accept and respect your opinion."
"People who are removing Kerr from the top 4, why? Sure you may think other coaches have created better schemes or such, but how can you argue with the results? Sure he's coaching 4 all stars, but 3/4 weren't even top draft picks and as a Warriors fan, I've watched them all be coached into developing skills on the court they never had when they first entered the league.       It's like not putting LeBron James in the top 10 players of all time because he forces whatever team he's on to change their play style. Sure, it's a valid point, but look at his accolades, his numbers, his consistency, regardless of whether or not he makes bigs like Kevin Love and Chris Bosh simple wing shooters, he's still one of the best players to have ever graced the court and the numbers show it, regardless of anything else. "
"They going on Steph might be their only way out, mainly because he´s still not 100% but they have no LeBron James to do it. CP3 seems to be hitting his stride at the right time, but Harden sometimes seems tired already, which is not unusual for him coming Playoff Time."
"Yeah, HOU can't exploit GS like they just did to Utah with this small ball lineup. If HOU goes small, GS can too and will have 4 elite perimeter defenders to contest every shot. And that small ball lineup for GS is ridiculous in transition so idk if HOU will ever force the issue.   HOU is going to have to come at Steph on defense but even then this is nothing they haven't seen a million times with LeBron James."

"ssssshhhhh...there are ""fans"" in here that get all their news from memes and espn. don't ruin the surprise for them when the playoffs roll around.   SPOILER: [LeBron James is good at basketball.](/spoiler)"
Lebron James Butler
"Small forwards. Most versatile position. Too fast / skilled for big men and too big for guards. There are also lots of great players at the position.   ""PG"" Lebron James ""SG"" Scottie Pippen  SF  Kawhi Leonard ""PF"" Larry Bird ""C"" Kevin Durant    Too good. "
"I see what you're trying to do. Trying to make the ""which James are you talking about"" question usually referring to Lebron/Harden to include Butler. You're literally forcing him into the conversation. Savvy strategy."
"I think the biggest problem that comes into play when you see older guys comparing their era to the current is nostalgia.    When Mutumbo recalls playing in the 80's and 90's he remembers the Jordan's, the Duncan's, the Bird's, the Shaq's, so on and so forth. It seems he, and many others,  tend to forget the less spectacular players (as in flashy or dominant, but not necessarily bad) they played with, like Mark Price, Sean Elliot, BJ Armstrong, Kevin Duckworth, James Donaldson or countless other players. These guys all mentioned were All-Stars when Mutumbo played. More likely than not if dropped into todays game would be reserve role players and most definitely would not be All-Stars.   Mutumbo is right that for the most part the game is less physical now of days... But that is on purpose. The game has become more advanced, more skilled, and more technical in almost every regard. Basketball used to be a game of size, dominated by bigs who could dominate the other team on both ends. I think this all really changed when Jordan came around and showed that you could win without a dominant big. Since then, teams have focused more on guards and wing players and developed these guys to basically be swiss army knives who can do it all. The game will continue to evolve and change and I'm sure 20-30 years from now some reporter will interview Dwight Howard or someone else, and they will claim ""no one from this era could have played back in my day with Kobe and Lebron and Curry and Embiid... They would have got run off the floor!""   Rinse, Cycle and Repeat."

"They would be comparable if all the stats were included.   Lonzo will never, ever, ever, in a billion years, ever be anywhere close to coming near how good Lebron James is. "
I mean they are pretty comparable stats.  If Lonzo becomes Lebron James without the athleticism I won't be upset at all.
yup. i wouldn't want to play with lebron either. I'll just go sit over here on the Phoenix Suns. Or maybe Sacramento has a spot. Wouldn't ever want to play with the best player in the NBA and go to the finals year after year after year. James Jones really carried him to those 3 rings.
"Why are all those ""Travel"" comments being downvoted? That is one of the most obvious travels in the game...  Here is the EXACT same possession from NBA Video Rulebook against LeBron James: http://videorulebook.nba.com/archive/travel-on-the-perimeter-lifts-and-steps-with-pivot-foot/   Lakers fans are just insane when it comes to objectivity and impartiality. For the love of god or any higher force you believe in, stop this toxic behavior."
"...... I read your history. You have issues with Kobe Bryant LOL  &gt;The comparison was that LeBron doesn't care about defense in the reg.season because he's old, and he's saving for the playoffs.  I disagree with this sentiment:  Lebron James DOES care about defense in the regular season; I have seen him perform at a very high level defensively for few key possessions.   Saving for the playoffs is also pretty weird considering Lebron James has been atrocious in the finals defensively QUITE often.   &gt;KG example of being awesome in the regular season AND in the playoffs while being old.  How in god's name is that a proper response to what I said? LOL  &gt;And Kobe, individually, had problems with Rondo.  This is just false LOL.   Kobe was roaming off Rondo in that finals, but even if you want to look at actual numbers:  Rondo averaged 13.6 points with 45% TS in 2010 finals after averaging 13.7 points with 54% TS that same season.  &gt;And we're talking indivudualy, LeBron is a good help defender in the playoffs too.  I agree  &gt;So i really don't care what you think.  Clearly not lol"
"Well once he gets a bad case of the cancer known as Lebron James, who knows how bad his game will become? :-P"
"It’s gonna be either of the James’, but if not then I’d put my money on Kyrie just because of the narrative. Ditching LeBron, Hayward’s heartbreaking injury and still probably going to finish first in the East and with 60+ wins on current pace. People and media love the storylines and Kyrie got the most storylines going for him. "
At this point I'd insert Lebron James Jr. over JR.
"""New Head Coach: LeBron James"""
"people would care about Lebron James or Lonzo Ball being LGBT, because we care about their personal lives period. if it was some random player, then we'd probably make a lot less of it. We'd still make a little something of it though.  "
Lebron James would finally get that international exposure
"Bronny being compared to his dad is inevitable, but as this [meme](https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/aOVqEv2_700b.jpg) shows, it makes it even harder for him to seperate himself from LeBron James, when his name is literally LeBron James. "
Dude was being called the GOAT and [The Chosen One](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/images/2002-0218-LeBron-James-001247453.jpg) before he was even drafted.
"Imagine Team Lebron vs. Team Curry, the narrative potential is through the roof  Team Curry  *Steph Curry*  *Kyrie Irving*  *Kevin Durant*  *Draymond Green*  *Anthony Davis*  vs.   Team Lebron  *Russell Westbrook*  *Paul George*  *Lebron James*  *Kristaps Porzingis*  *Demarcus Cousins*     "
"He's going to OKC. Durant left OKC to form a Big 4 (Him, Curry (another MVP) Green, and Thompson) LeBron will choose OKC to form his own Big 4 (James, Westbrook (another MVP) George, and Melo) to fuck with Durant. Boom."
"Because people think imperfections in elite teams are massive weaknesses but the fact remains they are talented elite teams. People do this every year with multiple teams and over react to every single streak, bump or slump along the way. Seasons are not a homogeneous series of games where you get the same effort and production every night. Competent predictive analysis needs to take a long view that is inherently not reactionary. The Cavs are still fast favorites to make the finals. That will be apparent when the play offs come around. They might not make it, that is always a chance and the east has some solid teams this year but the fact of the matter is that whatever team Lebron James is on is elite, and this Cavs team has too much talent to be actually incompetent. The Cavs defense and scoring depth will decide if its a 4 game or a 7 game series with GSW. That is the most likely split of outcomes from the Cavs season, and people pretend like their going to lose in the first round because the team fucks around in the regular season. "
"He is upset his team is underperforming versus an inferior team (no Lowry or Ibaka). It’s a lack of cohesion and effort that’ll be straightened out by the playoffs, as it always does. Maybe the Cavs will get bounced by the Warriors in 5 games or whatever but I’m not going to hit the panic alarm over yet another regular season “meltdown” of a LeBron James team.  In a few months, the Cavs will once again turn on the jets and make the eastern conference look like they’re playing in a different league. It’s an honest truth that LeBron is simply that much better than what the rest of the East is capable of. If you want to get riled up and eat up whatever narrative about “LeBron is losing the team” then I can point you to a long history of his teams looking like a mess in the regular season. We’ve seen it with the Hawks supposedly taking the east, we’ve seen it with the Celtics supposedly taking the east, and we’re seeing it again with the Raptors or whoever is going to get a higher seed. It just doesn’t matter. If seven years of absolute dominance doesn’t convince you then just wait a couple months and you’ll have another example of just how big the difference is between LeBron James and the average playoff contender."
When they don't make the Finals. LeBron James fans have seen this same news cycle play out almost every year.
"Mark my words:  Like Jordan, we are gonna find out years later just how much of an asshole LeBron James is."
Fake news   [LOLATHON234 Stats &amp; Info] LeBron James: went -21 in b2b games in the 2014 finals      https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201406100MIA.html    https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201406120MIA.html
"I dont remember this much salt being thrown at other really good teams, yet not champions. The ones in recent history that come to mind are:  - the Atlanta hawks  - Phoenix Suns - Portland trailblazers - Pacers  - LeBron James pre-decision   These were great teams to watch and cheer for. My favourite being the Suns, but hey, shit happens in the playoffs, and there’s only one Champion "
"Or  - he failed to help for the majority of the finals (He was pf that contest fewer shots than most of the starters).  - KD shot 75% against Lebron in the finals.   - Lebron James CONSISTENTLY blew his coverage defensively   There's no possible way anyone could say he was remotely positive in the finals. If he keyed in for couple possessions, that series could've easily went to 6"
Lebron's game boiled down is drive and kick mastery. So if you put the two best drivers in the game with an entire team who can shoot the three and a PG who can read the situation what exactly is the defense going to do? Cover the line? then you have Harden and Lebron driving in on a 1v1 with no help. If they try and stop that and they have someone hedging between the line and the rim Houston kicks it to the guy that has room for an open 3. All Houston has to do is give some of Hardens plays to James it is such an easy fit.
Yea he's been a consistent playoff performer...WITH LEBRON JAMES  as a teammate. DeRozan has been solid in the playoffs. Check yo numbers. The point being that Toronto is less ISO-ball reliant like past seasons.
"""I'm coming to Besiktas"" - LeBron James"
"Obviously, I am not going to overreact since it's January.   Thompson, Lebron, Isiah Thomas, Love, and JR Smith are all under average defensively. Interestingly enough, Lebron James might be one of our weaker defenders; It was kinda funny to me that Lebron James had a ""historical"" Finals last season, while people completely ignore the utter garbage that was his defense. Let me be clear, I have never, ever seen Kobe, Duncan, KG, etc play that garbage of a defense in the finals, even WHEN they were out of their prime.   Here's the issue, we can't expect Bron to turn up his defense in the playoffs anymore, because last season? He didn't show up in that end when it mattered most. Why am I emphasizing Bron's defense? It's because he was a PF for around half his possessions in the playoffs for us; Most teams don't win much when their PF or C is utter garbage defensively.   I can live with this results, but I am shocked that we fell this much in that end.   I think we are still going to make the Finals, but Celtics will be a HUGE challenge for us. "
"I mean, it’s like the~8th pick in the draft. You have **LeBron James** in his prime on your team. This could be the last year you have him. You have to do everything you can to win now, no matter how slim of a chance they have. If he leaves they are fucked regardless."
Lebron James ain't no Ronny Baker. He wanted nothing to do with that
Bro they’ve played like ass for 2 games. There’s 82 games in a season. And they have LeBron James. People on this sub are so reactionary it’s crazy. I do think the Celtics would’ve given the Cavs trouble but saying “no way” the cavs would win?? lol cmon. 
Watched it thrice only to realize that Lebron James doesn't have hair on his armpits
[James compared to his teammates](https://imgur.com/gallery/E6ggz)  I mean shit's just sad. I feel sorry for LeBron. If Lue doesn't get fired by the end of this week - Cavs are not winning anymore titles in the upcoming 10 years+. (Considering the fact that the team has no chance to win the title with him and LeBron leaves)
"What about retraining muscles do you not understand? You don't start walking with perfect technique as a baby. When a muscle/muscle group needs to be retrained it is literally reteaching yourself the movement that used to be 100% muscle memory from the ground up to help ensure that the issue doesn't persist. Confidence plays a part - we've seen superstars like LeBron James change his shooting form and free throw form on the regular while he tries to find something comfortable and effective. And that is NOT recovering from an injury. Sure, there is a mental aspect, but again, the problem 100% lies with the muscle imbalance and every physical and mental repercussion that recovering from that injury has. "

Celtics are going to send LeBron James packing from Cleveland twice after Brad Stevens leads us to the finals this year. Book it. 
The co-leading scorers at 13 apiece are LeBron James and Fred Van Vleet.  And Van Vleet did it with less minutes and less shots.  
"If you would have told me at the beginning of the year that a lineup of Fred Vanfleek, Lorenzo Brown, Pascal Siakam, Jakob Poeltl, and Norman Powell would have not only maintained a lead... but increased the lead against a LeBron James team.. I would have laughed so hard. But here we are.  This is the greatest Raptor team of all time and we are going to win the next 10 Larry O'Brien trophies idgaf "

Rookies cant shoot its always been that way except for the very rare exception.   Lebron freaking James’ ts% was .488 and his eFG was .428 thats not even that much higher than Lonzo and people here says he could be the worst shooter ever lol. 
"&gt; Despite the fact that he never played for them, the Heat retired Michael Jordan’s No. 23 before his final game in Miami in 2003.  &gt; “In honor of your greatness and for all you’ve done for the game of basketball – and not just the NBA, but for all the fans around the world – we want to honor you tonight and hang your jersey, No. 23, from the rafters,” Heat coach Pat Riley said. “No one will ever wear No. 23 for the Miami Heat. You’re the best.”  &gt; Jordan averaged 30.1 points in 38 career games against the Miami. LeBron James, who previously wore No. 23, announced his plans to switch to No. 6 out of respect for Jordan during what would turn out to be his final year in Cleveland.

"That's fair, it's just I've noticed that most generational talents tend too innovate how the game is played. The only guys I'd say have a case to  be put on the generational list without completely innovating their position is Kobe and Duncan. You could maybe take KD off the list and just call him the Kobe Bryant (MJ 2) of the LeBron James archetype, but I look at players like Giannis, Simmons and Ingram and see guys more inspired by KD's playstyle. "
"&gt; Youngest doesn't really matter  Why? Because it doesn't fit your narrative? Sorry kid, it does matter, what's what was shown everywhere and will be shown always. Youngest. Just like it was shown Lonzo Ball is the youngest player to record a Triple Double since LeBron James. Youngest will always matter. It's most impressive    Plus LeBron's 20k is more impressive because he is the best playmaker ever maybe since Magic, the all around playmaker and IQ everything. But that type of pass first dude cracking 20k at that age before anyone else, will always be the most impressive. Don't hate, witness greatness"

"Gotta take Lebron. Because then the ski-mask bandits would be like, “Oh shit it’s Lebron James!

"LeBron James never was able to adjust into his role as 6th man, and his poor play off the bench led to his minutes being cut throughout the season, and ended in his eventually being demoted to the G-League at the end of the 2037-38 season. "
"LeBron James and 6th man will never exist in the same sentence unless a ""never was"" is in between them"
"If the Cavs record is significantly worse than the Rockets and ESPECIALLY if the Cavs don't take the 1 seed again, I can't realistically see LeBron winning over Harden, provided he doesn't miss too much more time.  I also don't think Curry, KD, or Giannis are entirely out of the running, though it would take a lot more for them to userp both James' current cases."
We'd like a Lebron James please. 
"&gt;Suppose Curry wins 2-3 more rings  I think that should have very little to do with it.  My opinion of him won't change much at all whether he wins more titles or not (which he probably will).    1) He's expected to at this point, so it shouldn't really make him seem like a *better* player than he already is  2) Not winning would be disappointing but that shit happens...and he will likely face a ~~prime~~ taller, stronger, better shooting Lebron James than we've seen to date...before he goes ""playoff mode"".  Anything can happen.  All of that said, I think it's *possible* for him to be considered ~5 at the end of his career if his career is long and sustained.  I don't think it's probable though."
"Alternately phrased:  ""LeBron James has a reputation as a machine and never getting hurt, evidenced by his never missing more than 13 games in a full season."""

lol imagine that third guy just randomly cleaning a murder scene with Lebron james and curry.
"Lebron "" I just stopped eating sugar"" James"
The real question is why isn’t it happening to LeBron James.  What’s happening to Anthony is normal.
https://imgur.com/zHAqMSx LeBron James king of burgers!
"the thing i dont get is, if lebron told the cavs 'im re-signing for sure if you go all in' the cavs would trade every pick and make every move possible to be in contention for boogie, AD, PG13, DJ, etc.  but by keeping them in limbo about it, they wouldn't want to throw out youth/future because if he decides to leave they're fucked for another decade.  it seems strange that the only thing stopping james from improving his team is his own choice to not talk."
**OUR ECONOMY'S BASED ON LEBRON JAMES**
Except that this is actually true. Lots of arrogance from those so ignorant in this thread.   http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-03/lebron-james-calls-aussie-ben-simmons-the-heir-to-his-throne-in/9505544
I think is name is Lebron James?
1. Lebron  2. Steph  3. KD  4. Kawhi  5. James Harden  6. Anthony Davis  7. Damian Lillard  8. Russ  9. Giannis  10. Embiid
"No matter how much you want to equate personal greatness and rings, I’ll remind you championships are a team achievement. Not a player one. I’ll highlight this very simply for ya:   Who won the NBA finals in 2016? Wrong answer: Lebron James. Correct answer: Cleveland Cavaliers.   See the difference ?? Lebron James was on the team that won, yes, but he himself certainly did not win the Finals. Him and the team he was on did. Ultimately, Great teams &gt; Decent teams with a great player or two.   So as much as you wanna use finals records as who is the better player, when you look at things from an objective POV that’s such a weak argument.   With all that said, Lebron in his 2nd finals vs the Mavs is a stain on his resume for sure. I would argue him never losing in the first round (Jordan did multiple times) and all his Herculean performances to carry his (bad) teams to the Finals and deep into the playoffs - this year and 2007 being prime examples - make up for it in the Jordan vs Lebron debate. Other than that, Lebron has straight up balled in every single finals he’s played in, and the ones he’s lost fall on the rest of his team not showing up when he did. "
"LeBron already plays PG and SF KD is playing PF and SF.   I could see them bench JR and front a Heavy Hill, KD,James,TT,Love lineup."
"&gt;LeBron does not pass the torch to anyone.  ""Just get the rebound!""  -LeBron James"
"I don't hold out anything. I'm perfectly aware of the circumstances but yes, 3-5 is 3-5. Both LeBron and Kobe have winning records in the playoffs. LeBron even moreso against the East than Kobe against the West. But in the Finals, LeBron has a losing record. Kobe does not. Statistics don't mean more to me than winning championships. Kobe went 6-24 for 23 points and 15 rebounds in Game 7 against the Celtics. The Lakers won by 4 points, got the title and Kobe got a Finals MVP. LeBron James went 9-24 for a triple double, 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in Game 7 against the Warriors. The Cavaliers won by 4 points, got the title and LeBron got a Finals MVP. They both shot terribly and only won by four points but in light of winning the title and getting the Finals MVP, shooting badly and winning by 4 points in a Game 7 is nothing. "
"No. What happened was when LeBron found out Kyrie wanted to leave he went to Cavs managment and said ""ok get me Eric Bledsoe and Paul George. We can go after the Warriors with that team."" Instead he got an injured 5'8 PG who happens to be the one PG in the league whose worse defensively then Kyrie and a future pick that wont ever help him win a title. At that point, LeBron looked at his roster and understood the only way for them to be even marginally successful, he would have to carry the entire load, which he's done. Very similar to the pre\-decision Cleveland teams.   That being said, I do believe he was motivated by his own legacy this season. The trademark of this part of LeBron's career is going to be his longevity. Nobody has been this good for this long. Hence all the #year15 stuff, it's marketing. It's good for his brand. As is going to the finals again this year. Those are all apart of his legacy and I think that has been a big motivation for him this year \(as well is being good for business, shouts to Mav Carter and Rich Paul\). The question for LeBron this offseason will be what's better for his legacy, staying in Cleveland and continuing to be a dominate force into his late 30's OR leaving to form another super team \(Philly, maybe LA\) and taking a lesser role but winning titles and maybe even matching Mike's 6 rings. This is assuming he doesn't think Cleveland will be able to get more high level talent around him and let's be honest, this organization has done nothing in it's entire history to make us believe they are competent enough to build a championship quality team without having a string of #1 overall picks and having the greatest player of all time born in their backyard and coming back to their dumpster fire of an organization despite them proving their incompetency over and over again.  LeBron is motivated by personal as well as communal goals. As we all are. But no, I don't think he chased stats so he could win MVP this year. I beleive he chose himself for MVP because by the definition of the award, it goes to the player with the most value. No player brings more value to the court than Lebron James. He theoretically is the most deserving player every year. But that's not how that award is decided in practicality. Jordan had the same thing happen to him, people just get bored of him winning the award. "
"I was more focused on playoff statistics.   There’s a reason lebron has more playoff games played. He single handedly brings his teams to the playoffs. Jordan could barely get out of the first round before he had Pippen. He’s not as smart of a player as Lebron is, and is not nearly on his BBIQ level, even if Jordan was a better scorer.   Lebron James is 7th all time in playoff rebounds, 3rd all time in playoff assists, and 1st in points and steals. That demolishes any of Jordan’s individual playoff accomplishments, and the “lebron has played more games” argument is irrelevant. Nobody forced Jordan to retire 20 times. It’s not lebrons fault that he has been consistent his whole career, even when he was in terrible teams. "
"It's not out of the realm of possibilities...unless you're a LeBron James fan boi. Then it's verboten sacrilege. Lance Armstrong and Barry Bonds never failed a single test and they were eventually implicated for using PED's. So I'll give you Ortiz because it doesn't really matter to me if he used or not, they still won the championships. Which are moments that can never be taken away. Most likely every pro athlete is on some type of secret sauce.  Stuff that is ahead of the testing curve. (Here's a great JRE with Victor Conté on the topic https://youtu.be/azzhD2QJ8B0)  I don't hold this against LeBron but it does make me wonder about his improved performance as he ages.  Not to wonder and to shout down anyone who brings it up is kind of silly, but everyone needs a cause.  Either way it will be a fun series. GO CELTICS!!! "
"I absolutely never said they wouldn’t be a better team, but we are talking about LeBron James here. He wants a championship. And I completely agree with you about PG. He fits the team the way they’re built. "
"If you want to make the argument that the whole will be less than the sum of it's parts, I agree; but let's not pretend they won't be a better team by adding Lebron James.  I personally think they would be better as a team by adding PG than Lebron. PG is a easily a better fit."
youre telling me lebron fucking james wouldnt find a way to play with a ball dominant guard? Sounds alot like what people were saying about James and Wade.
I think it wouldn't make sense to keep Simmons if they bring in LeBron.  I'd recommend trading Simmons to the Knicks for Porzingis or some other package.  Too much overlap between Simmons and James.
1. LeBron James 2. James Harden 3. KD 4. Steph Curry 5. Anthony Davis 6. Russ 7. Giannis  8. Kyrie Irving 9. Joel Emiid 10. KAT  I’m probably forgetting some players
"And when will that be? Essentially, in this scenario, you’re assuming LeBron James exhibits a new found patience for player development and has also chosen that he will no longer be the catalyst of his own championship aspirations; it will all rely on the development of Ben Simmons.   They certainly couldn’t win a championship together as their games currently stand. Think about the championship Cavs roster and the amount of shooting and scoring they surrounded LeBron with to *upset* the Warriors. Now, also consider the Sixers/Celtics series where Ben Simmons had to be moved to the 4 so that the Celtics couldn’t just ignore him when playing defense. Where does LeBron James fit into that? Does he now become the point guard and primary ball handler while Ben is plugged into the paint? Wouldn’t this then clog the paint for LeBron as the Celtics send extra help on his drives knowing that Simmons and Embiid outside jump shots are poor shots?  "
Can't wait for him to get exposed this series by the coaching savant that is ~~Tyronn Lue~~ Lebron James.  FIFY
Lebron best player in the world james didn't even show up for that finals  He got bullied by deshawn stevenson

"When listening to sports radio or on lots of talk shows when ever they mention superstars they often say” a Lebron James, a Kevin Durant, a James Harden, a Russell Westbrook.” And then they get to their point or they’ll talk about top point guards and talk about Chris Paul, Lilard and Westbrook and dove into their topic and never even mention him. I get that he was injured for a lot of the season but come on you could at least mention him. I don’t need them to gush about him but you shouldn’t ignore that he exists."
Everybody: The best way to use LeBron James is to surround him with shooters....  76ers: Okay but what if we surrounded him with Simmons and Fultz...
Exactly. We know how Ben Simmons plays and we know he is not anywhere close to the level of shooter LeBron James likes to play with. 
Are Sixers fans new to basketball or something? Do you really not see the issue with Ben Simmons and LeBron James playing together? Do you really think LeBron James is entering free agency thinking about who he’d like to mentor next year? The guy wants to win. Every single team he has been on has been built around finding him shooters. Why would this suddenly change?
"Lebron James, he just never took that next step."
Hey this is the REAL Lebron James. I would like to play in Philly but only in a sign and trade for Ben Simmons thx bye.
"LeBron James is by far the best all time player when you look at individual talent and it's not even close. Anyone who thinks that MJ is a better individual player has rose-tinted nostalgia goggles on. If you replace Prime Jordan with Prime LeBron on those bulls teams, LeBron would have more Rings then Fingers. "
Lebron James will be better than Hayward for every year of their careers. 
He is a good enough defender that trying to target him isn’t really work it. It’s still Lebron James in the end.

"
"Not a better team than with lebron but definitely become better than currently and also doesn’t risk the chance of stunting Simmons or Embiid’s growth with a similarly ball dominate player but then again it is Lebron James, not saying i’d hate to get him and maybe he realizes the ball dominance and will take a more off ball role for the team"
"Have you ever known someone that drew insanely well? Or someone that could do complicated math problems in their head? There are outliers and on a planet of 5 billion people over the course of decades, it would be weird if a Lebron James DIDN’T exist. "
Then take away max contracts. The reason we had to take such drastic measure was because we were going to be paying Jrue Holiday and Thad Young pretty much the same as what the Heat were paying LeBron James and Dwyane Wade.  It's pretty well known that superstars and title contenders bring in much more money to a city than mediocrity.
I'm pretty sure when you mention 2016 NBA finals nobody mentions asterisk.  They undoubtedly mention a 73-9 team with unanimous MVP losing a 3-1 lead to LeBron James led Cleveland Cavaliers.
Not that hard to “outcoach” someone when you have Lebron fucking James on your team.
"There is no fucking way you guys would be a better team with Paul George than you would be with LeBron James, ""fit"" or no ""fit"""
"1.	We saw how Orlando started the season... better than everyone. You could see they were heading to the the top of the east, but LeBron doesn’t want to join an already dominant team, so they quieted down to get another top pick for LeBron. He also can stay in the eastern conference with an already elite, but silent, team.   2.	LeBron cares about winning and his family. He can win in Orlando, as shown in point 1. His wife wants to be in LA, most likely because it is warm. For those not from Florida, Orlando is also warm. Better yet, cost of living in Orlando is much lower than LA.   3.	Disney World. You know Disney World would provide the James family free passes all year, and it would greatly benefit the industry. I don’t want to make assumptions, but LeBron must be secretly investing in Disney right now because travel to Orlando is about to hit a record high.   4.	LeBron can live wherever he wants all summer and for the rest of his life, which will likely be LA. However, some movies are also filmed in Florida and specifically Orlando. It would be absurd to ignore the Orlando market for this kind of stuff.  Yeah Philadelphia or Houston provide guaranteed winning, but his legacy takes a hit. I personally have been putting a lot of money on the Orlando Magic being his final destination, and maybe you should too."
"Nope, you are the one revising history. Kobe and Lebron were at the top of the league and the debate was always Kobe vs Lebron. Nike was making puppet commericals about them, all the Christmas day matchups were between them. Everyone wanted them to meet in the finals to see who was better.  In 2007 Lebron James has a great playoffs, goes to the finals and loses. In 2008 Kobe wins MVP, has a great playoffs, goes to the finals and loses. In 2009 Lebron wins MVP, Kobe has a great playoffs, goes to the finals and wins. In 2010 Lebron wins MVP, Kobe has a great playoffs, goes to the finals and wins.   Then of course the next decade starts with Lebron going to every finals since 2011 and Kobe declines into retirement."
1) Lebron James  2) Steph Curry  3) Kawhi Leonard  4) Kevin Durant  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Giannis Antetokounmpo  8) Jimmy Butler  9) Rudy Gobert  10) Paul George  Yeah I know it's a bit two-way player centric compared to others but I think you guys underrate defense.
"I understand the thought behind this and sort of agree, but again, we are talking about Lebron James here.. I highly doubt he wouldn't find a way to fit."
"Yea because it makes sense to chase a free agent like Paul George or LeBron James when half our team isn't developed, our star is out, and we're not ready to make a playoff push.   It's a waste of cap space and waste of an opportunity to get top draft picks.  We have enough cap space to get a guy like Julius Randle who's young enough to be a part of our immediate future but won't hamper us from getting a top 10 pick"

"Hey, this is LeBron James. I would like to play in Philly but only if Ben Simmons is traded for Dwight Howard thx bye"
James Johnson (Heat version) is a pretty damn good Lebron stopper. I'd say he's one of the top 3 guys and at times can actually shut Lebron down. 
The Warriors will beat the Cavs in 5 games. KD will leave in free agency and join Lebron James... on the LA Lakers who have just acquired Kawhi in a trade. Everyone is happy about this because he is not joining the guy who beat him and the Lakers did not win too many games last year or some other totally arbitrary standards that just got made up 2 years ago.

Tatum has help there because Horford is in front of Lebron. If that wasn't the case or they realize these passes are actually going to be open and be made they will. Brown has two hands on Lebron when he goes for the post up with no one to help deny a pass inside. James comes out because it would have been hard to get the pass in there and he would have to fight more. Brown allowed the catch more easily because James came out farther to get it.
I literally told you he's 5th. People in this sub keep repeating this narrative of kd being a top 3 or even the best scorer ever and it's uninformed. And of course you assume Kobe is there too lol.

"I don’t think anyone on the Warriors is under appreciated other than maybe a bench player or two, but I sort of get what you’re saying. The people that hate the Warriors do so because they hate seeing the same team always win. It’s the same reason everyone hates the Patriots and the same reason tons of people hate LeBron. They always win, and they always make great teams look like a bunch of third round rookies. Just because people hate soemone doesn’t mean they don’t understand or appreciate how good they are though.   Just look at James Harden. This sub fucking hates that guy, but the majority of this sub also thinks he should be MVP. One thing does not have to have an impact on the other."
"6 years in the NBA is a lot and Kobe was drafted in '96 so it's more like 7. By the Time Lebron was being drafted, Kobe already had 3 of his rings. Regardless of how he got there, that's a whole era centered around Kobe and the Lakers that went by without James  I don't think it's that hard to argue they are different generations"
blowing a 3-1 lead to lebron james is one thing  blowing a 3-1 lead to josh smith is just next level
Ever since he became a good long\-range shooter he's been impossible to count out. I still think the Warriors or Rockets would both wreck Cleveland this year but you can never rule out a surprise with Lebron James.
LeBron James  Strengths:  Everything except for free throws.  Weaknesses:  Free throws.
"So LeBron become your primary ball handler, which means Ben becomes your secondary ball handler. This means Fultz never really gets to play that James Harden role we’ve all been envisioning for him. I think that’s where the development gets stunted. "

"""Pierce is salty about Lebron cause Lebron always destroyed him"".  Pierce on the Celtics won two playoff series against Lebron in 2008 and 2010 and lost two in 2011 and 2012. He later lost one more against on the Nets when he was 36 years old.  In 2008 Lebron shot 35.5% against Pierce in the Conference Semifinals and Pierce dropped 41 against him in Game 7 (Lebron had 45 that game, really epic battle).  In 2010 Lebron shot 44.7% against Pierce  In 2012 Game 5 the Celtics took a 3-2 series lead against Miami on the road cause Pierce hit a dagger 3 right in Lebron's face.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_uulujs-MM  -------  I am not saying Pierce outplayed or even played on the same level as James during their matchups but he definitely had alot more success against Lebron than many others. James even went as far as calling him one of this toughest rivals.   The other part of the narrative also isn't true because Pierce regularly gives credit to Lebron on air and even predicted the Cavs 2016 Finals comeback."

"Michael Jordan was and is the best scorer of all time. If you were to ask who the best overall basketball player of all time is the answer is LeBron James. He can score just as well as Mike, but LeBron does everything else at a higher level. When it's all said and done LeBron could have 38-40k points 10k rebounds and 10k assists. That is an unbeatable record in today's NBA. Yes he has a losing record in the Finals, but Micheal never faced the opposition LeBron faced. The NBA of the 90's was expanding and the talent was diluted across several expansion teams. LeBron would easily beat any of the 6 teams Micheal beat in the Finals, but you cannot say the same about Micheal beating the Spurs/Warriors. Yes LeBron has the 2011 Finals loss, but he also never has lost in the first round, Micheal has lost in the first round multiple times. All in all, anyone can bring up something that one player did accolades wise but when you look at the stats and the impact on the game, Lebron has every player ever beat."
"I love KD as much as the next guy that loves KD, but let’s say you replace KD with Lebron for the current warriors and they have   Curry/Klay/Lebron/Iggy/Green  Isn’t that like the GOAT team Unquestionably? It’s a Lebron James team with the two greatest shooters of the 3 ball of all time and then two DPOY level defenders with great IQ and passing.  What the fuck even happens when Lebron drives but instead of fucking Love he’s kicking it to Curry on the wing. Would it suck to see Steph relegated to being a rich, billionaires weapon for Lebron to kick to? Maybe. Would they ever lose? They would sweep the fucking Jordan Bulls.   Lebron James Cavs take a game from KDs Warriors, but KDs Cavs get obliterated by a Lebron Warriors.   I can’t even imagine how you could ever possibly expect to stop them on offense, the worst look they get is a Lebron drive and if he dosnt like it they send the ball around to see if either splash bro is wide open before giving it back to Bron to repeat. They can definitely get enough stops you aren’t gonna get the 120-130 points they will score every night.   I think that scenario alone must kinda prove that wrong. Team is so insane to think about I think that comment broke my brain. "
5th all-time.   1. Lebron James  2. Michael Jordan  3. Kareem Abdul Jabbar.  4. Kobe Bryant  5. Tim Duncan  6. Shaq 7.  Bill Russell  8. Magic Johnson  9. Wilt 10. Karl Malone

I think you'd have to be extremely naive not to think players would use whatever edge they can get especially with the NBA's lax testing. The best player in the NBA in LeBron James most likely uses PEDs.
People seriously consider LeBron 5 finals losses James is the GOAT so that take honestly doesn't surprise me.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Against two most effective isolation players in the league? That's been like the Rockets' plan whole season. They're the last team you wanna do this on.  That's how they won 65 games and 4-1 against two good teams. James Harden has higher usage these playoffs than LeBron James.  The first thing they will wanna do is isolate them on Curry and push, tire and annoy him. Other key GSW player would do to. ""Letting Harden and CP3 get theirs"" means letting them get fouls every play, which leads to frustration and weariness and foul trouble, one thing I can imagine downing the Warriors."
Chris Paul George.  LeBron James Harden.  Dayum.
Kobe and LeBron are of the same generation? @\_@  Kareem was the 1980s best  Jordan was the 1990s best and all\-time GOAT  Tim Duncan or Kobe Bryant was the 2000s best.  LeBron James is the 2010s best..
"I saw LeBron James at a grocery store in Boston yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
"The NBA MVP award is RIGGED!  Crooked Adam Silver wants Floppy James Harden to get the award over Lebron James, who is superior in every way and is the best player, maybe ever.  Lebron has no help. Nervous Kevin Love is his best teammate!  Sad!"
"Magic won more rings, stomped Bird's Celtics twice, and had significantly better playoff stats and performances.  Pretty much every advanced and simple statistic Magic has the advantage in. Magic was a better passer and harder to guard. He was much more efficient than Bird. The only thing Bird did better than Magic was shoot and score. Magic was a better or equal player at every single facet of the game.   This isn't even getting into their playoff numbers. Magic's playoff numbers are nuts. Magic had over 200 assists in a single postseason 6(!!) times including a year where he had over 300. Bird never got over 165 in a playoff run. To put this in perspective, not even LeBron James has a single 200 assist playoff run. And the advanced stats favor Magic as well. He was significantly more efficient in the postseason and his win shares, VORP, and offensive rating were all significantly higher while their defensive ratings were basically equal. Magic raised his game in the playoffs in a way that Bird didn't, which is insane because Bird was a playoff killer.  "
"No antics of today can compare to the insane disrespect of past basketball, with the trashtalk drama, fights, you name it. Different times.  But in the modern era, when Lebron was asked in 2016 how he felt going into game 5 of a series tied 2-2,  and he responded that [""I've been a part of some really adverse situations, and I just didn't believe that this was one of them.""](http://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland-cavaliers/post/_/id/2830/lebron-james-didnt-believe-this-was-a-really-adverse-situation), and then proceeded to beat Toronto **ten times consecutively** over the next 3 years... that was one of the most singularly disrespectful and ruthless moves that I've ever seen a player make. Lebron isn't really known for trash talk or disrespect, I mean he's actually a pretty damn corny dude most of the time. But that  might be the singularly most disrespectful move I've seen in the modern era, especailly when you take into account the narrative surrounding those 10 consecutive wins (like his goofy ass buzzer beater where it seemed like he just took a more difficult shot to show that he could, and etc)."
“Yeah that LeBron James guy is pretty good at basketball so I would probably try to shut him down”
"The mock drafts usually don't become accurate until around the day of the draft. There's still the draft combine and private workouts that need to happen, and how those go can change where a guy is drafted.  As far as who are the best players in the draft, the mock drafts and expert player projections are generally wildly off. Sometimes there is obvious superstar talent that goes #1 most of the time (think Tim Duncan, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, KAT, etc.). Outside of those though, things get wild.  This is why it's stupid when people say a player like Mikal Bridges or Marvin Bagley or something won't be better than guys like Ayton or Doncic. Not sying that is necessarily the case, but just because people consider Doncic/Ayton to be the top 2 doesn't mean they should, just means most people are shit at evaluating these guys. (My personal analysis is Ayton is a bust, Doncic will be good, but most likely not the best player in the draft).  In particular teams are terrible at evaluating wing players. Lebron and Durant were considered generational talents during their drafts and went #1/#2 because of that. The other top wings, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antekoumpo, Klay Thompson, Paul George, and Kawhi Leonard all went towards the end of the lottery or later. "
The rights to Lebron James Jr. 
"Well, Popovich did talk to LaMarcus Alridge and said he wouldn't trade him unless he could get a Kevin Durant in return. So... maybe he says the same to Kawhi, ""hey Kawhi, we will trade you to the Cavs, but only if Lebron James comes here, otherwise, your ass goes on the court to play.""  So, I don't see Pop trading Kawhi to the Cavs. The Cavs have nothing of value. The only valuable thing they could have is first round picks. Maybe Love and first round picks. But otherwise?"
"&gt;(a lot of people said the same thing here)  That's because people post every play he doesn't get back on defense and it is front page news here lol. He does it once a game at least for sure but I saw Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant do the same thing regularly in their series but they are considered good defenders. In fact, Davis never runs back on defense.  Lebron is ranked 112 in defensive rating (per game) these playoffs right behind Kyle Anderson and Giannis and ahead of Ben Simmons, Jonas Valanciunis, Jimmy Butler.   James is also ranked 56th in defensive win shares per game in these playoffs ahead of Terry Rozier, Steven Adams, Jae Crowder etc.  Moreover if you look at the counting stats they are also good for James as he is averaging 1.5 steals and 1 block per game in these playoffs. For comparison Kevin Durant is averaging 1 steal and 1 block in these playoffs."
"Curry is one of the most under appreciated players *in this subreddit*. He gets, what I believe to be, a fair amount of air time in sports media. In this sub, however, he’s completely overlooked for how good he is. He’s probably the second or third most valuable player you can have on your team in the league behind LeBron James/maybe KD. He doesn’t get much talk here because he’s a sharpshooter, not so much a driver (though he *can* he) so the only time he produces highlights are when his threes are timely. If he played for a worse team he’d get talked up a lot more, but because he’s part of the Golden State war machine he’s left out of the discussion.  I mean, you have to think about how much LeBron is talked about in comparison to Curry and how relevant it is to the value he produces vs the value Curry does."
"&gt; Give me a link showing Lebron's Per100 poss. against Morris for that season.  I did. It's the third paragraph of the article. Unless you're accusing Haberstroh of lying about these numbers for some reason and you need to see a second source to confirm it?   ""By some measures, Morris was the NBA’s best defender of LeBron James during the 2015-16 regular season. **According to ESPN’s Tom Haberstroh, James averaged just 20.5 points per 100 possessions when defended by Morris — his lowest average against any defender in the league that season.** That’s a striking statistic compared to James’s average over the course of that entire season: 36.5 points per 100 possessions.""  Is that not good enough for you?  "
"Lebron James is so averse to the negative reaction he gets from missing game winners that he sabotages himself late in the game by taking crazy shots that have a very low chance of going in. The kind of shots where if they go in you think they're the best shots you've ever seen (and they often are) but if they miss you go ""well that was a really tough shot, can't really fault him for missing"". At the end of games he could drive and get a really good look for a bucket 8/10 times but instead chooses fadeaways and long jumpers that work a lot less often."
Philly and Lebron James wouldn’t be a good fit 
"LeBron James is incredibly patronizing to his teammates and I’m surprised players have kept relatively quiet on this issue; But because he’s so good, no one wants to admit that LeBron is, often times unnecessarily, a dickhead.  You can see the way he talks about his teammates in diminutive terms; he speaks about them as if they were lower in stature not just as players, but as people; the classic example of this is the way he spoke about Kyrie time and time again. I can understand being confident, but what I can’t understand is being an asshole on top of it.   I also think Kyrie got no credit from anyone for that shot in the 2016 finals, and Kyrie should’ve won Finals MVP in that series for that shot alone. "

Lebron James 
Lebron James has a big beard and puts up ridiculous numbers.   He goes zero dark thirty for the playoffs by cutting off his social media.  James Harden has a big beard and puts up ridiculous numbers.   He goes zero dark thirty for the playoffs by cutting off his strip club.
"Never said that you said anything about the clear second best basketball player ever. I’m talking about the GOAT, LeBron James.

Or are you just trying to ignore reality to make yourself feel better about your team being irrelevant now? "
"Wall has far better vision/passing, what Lowe says here, Wall is in the same tier as Harden and Lebron.  &gt;Westbrook is not as innovative a passer as James or Harden. He has led the league in assists mostly making drive-and-kick passes the defense expects. It is a tribute to Westbrook's greatness that he can break apart defenses so often, and so completely, as to lead the NBA in assists making expected passes. James and Harden make unexpected passes. They are two and three steps ahead. James especially triggers passing sequences. The Thunder ranking dead last in total passes is an annual tradition.  And he's a much better defender than Westbrook.

"I would still say that in terms of value, that emotional overreaction is still close to how valuable he is irl. I mean the guy has been to 7 straight finals, meaning the only playoff series’ he has lost in that time are Finals series.  There are other players who are just way more overyhyped/overrated imo typically stemming from stat heads/efficiency police that dont take inherent value in certain on court skills. That leads to a large discrepancy of how highly regarded they are here when in reality theyre simply placed in a particular role/situation where their strengths are used and weaknesses mitigated.   Way too many candidates (that i cant even think of off the top of my head) for you to start your list off with Lebron James"

"LeBron ""father of 3"" James has MASTERED playing the victim card"
Jordan was better as a scorer and as a defender. LeBron is obviously a better all around player but more clutch? No. I've watched both players over their entire careers and he's not. Statistics don't lie but they don't tell the whole story either. Furthermore James is not as tough mentally as he was. Jordan was ice cold even then. It took LeBron much longer to get even close to that mentality and he still isn't there yet.

"Well, Carter bailed out on Toronto mid-season, pretty much openly declaring that he was not going to try.  He tanked, openly, and only for himself.  It was a disturbing display of selfishness to a club that loved him dearly and really revered him, and for those fans old enough to have been around then, you don't forget a giant jerk move like that.  It's much like when LeBron James created a TV show to announce how much of a dick he was going to be to Ohio and to Cleveland and humiliating them on National TV.  That does not ever fully wash away - Even if Cleveland sold its soul and dignity to get him to come back, the rest of the world didn't."

Lebron James is a incredible human being  He is a role model to a lot of kids growing up 
Can we talk about how LeBron James is the most clutch player ever?
LeBron James
"&gt; Yes I know they’re not matching up against each other, but it would still give you more insight to a teams strengths and weaknesses than if you picked a 4 game sample size.  Seems to me that past performance against the team you are about to play a 7 game series against is more relevant than how you played against other teams.  Atlanta won 60 games and got swept by a 53 win Cavs team in the playoffs.  A 73 team Golden State team lost to a 57 win Cavs team in a game 7 on their court.  The regular season is irrelevant come playoff time.  Especially when you have to beat LeBron James 4 out of 7 games.  No regular season matchups against other teams is going to adequately prepare you for that challenge.  &gt;  This type of shooting is unsustainable for a team in a best of four series. It’s not a precursor of things to come.  You just said they shot 50% from 3 in four games.  The minimum amount of games in a playoff series is 4 games, so why would that be impossible for them to replicate? Cavs shot 46% against the Raptors from 3 last year in the playoffs so it's not like it's that big of a stretch.  Cavs have great 3 point shooters.  &gt; Siakam is one of the most athletic bigs in the whole NBA.  LeBron is arguably the most athletic big in the history of the NBA.  &gt; He’s a more athletic big than anyone on the Indy’s roster.   And yet, LeBron averages more points against the Raptors than he does the Pacers, so what difference does that make?  &gt; The Raptors have the personnel to take advantage of that  Then do it.  In the past your best players crumbled under the pressure.  &gt; If Kevin Love has another off series, and can’t run JV off the court, then JV is going to look like Wilt reincarnate.  Most of Love's problems came from the Cavs forcing the ball into him in the low post while he was being doubled.  When they started using him in the pick and roll, his game opened up.  My hope is that Lue won't repeat the same mistake twice.    &gt;  If the Cavs role players have another off season, I don’t think it’ll be close.  Yeah, if they continue to play like shit it shouldn't.  They couldn't play much worse than they did against the Pacers so there's hope. "
Lebron James Jr. would be the second best player on the Cavs right now. 
"Context matters.  LeBron lost a top 15 player, had the most useless and toxic player in the league on his team for 20 games at a 30% Usg%, had to put up with Derrick Rose for half a season, had a complete overhaul of the team mid-season, lost Kevin Love for 40 games, had one of the most efficient and best statistical years of his career, and still managed to win the same amount of games as the previous season.   James Harden added a top 3 point guard and flops a lot and hes about to win his 1st MVP entirely because of narrative.  Dont get me wrong, I like James Harden.  But he is not a more valuable player than LeBron.  Put IT on Hardens team for 20 games and give him a 30% usg% and see what happens to his teams record and Hardens stats."
You sign LeBron James to whatever deal he wants and don't think twice about it. Not even close
"Just curious, why is LeBron James allowed to commit lane violations every time he takes a free throw? It's made his % skyrocket"
"if Lowry/DeRozan turn into the trash bros while being defended by Jose Calderon, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, and George Hill then yeah it's kind of a choke job.   Otherwise there is no shame in losing to LeBron James. We've seen him assert his will enough times to say anything is possible with him.  Assuming this summer LeBron goes to a better situation (or CLE uses the BRK pick to trade for an all-star running mate), this is possibly the best chance the Raptors (or anyone else in the East right now) has at dethroning LeBron."
"Try to use some critical thinking lol the cavs get outscored by 40, yet they won the series. The Cavs have a guy named LeBron James. Now you make the connection. Go. "
Who’s your player that would do it? James harden is the only man I can think of and he can’t play that kind of defense that Lebron can (also he’d probably need more rest)  Even Durant I don’t think could just pull this out with this cast. He’s the closest to Lebron but less playmaking and less durability

"&gt;Magic did not announced he had HIV until November 1991. He lost the Finals in June.   ok? like i said, he was only ""near retirement"" because he retired due to HIV. otherwise, he was still putting up prime numbers and clearly had plenty of years left if not for the HIV. he played in the all star game and olympics the next year and also tried to come back until his health was too much a distraction.  &gt;In fact, the leading scorers in the 1991 Finals for the Lakers were (in order) James Worthy, Magic Johnson, Vlade Divac, and Sam Perkins; all 4 were the only guys to average double digit points for LA.   how many players do you think typically average in double figures for a single time? what point do you think you're making here?  &gt; Let's add in the Lakers got SWEPT in the Finals two years before to the Pistons.  the lakers got swept because first kareem got hurt, then magic got hurt, then worthy got hurt, all in the same series. the pistons probably win in a longer series, but to act like they got swept because obviously they sucked now is either disingenuous or plain ignorant.  &gt;In the next playoffs, Magic was out of the league and the Lakers leading scorer was..... Byron Scott at 18ppg. They lost 3-1 in the first round btw.  losing your best player and one of the greatest of all time will generally make a team worse. i don't know what point you think you're making here.  &gt;Let me add another fun fact: Jordan NEVER WON A GAME against the 1980s Celtics dynasty in the playoffs.  jordan played one of the greatest teams of all time when his fellow starters were dave corzine, gene banks, earl cureton, sidney green, kyle macy, etc. i blame jordan for getting his ass kicked about as much as i blame lebron for getting his ass kicked in the '07 finals (as in not at all).  any other fake bullshit for me to debunk or does that about do it?"

The only thing in Lebron's favor, as I've stated, is he's had more opportunity.   * Lebron James 1.78 SPG over 224 playoff games - 10th all-time SPG (399 Total)  FYI:  * Mo Cheeks 2.22 SPG over 133 playoff games - 1st all-time SPG (295 Total / 497 adjusted) * Isiah Thomas 2.11 SPG over 111 playoff games - 2nd all-time SPG (234 total / 472 adjusted) * Jordan 2.10 SPG over 179 playoff games - 3rd overall (376 Total / 470 adjusted) * Clyde Drexler &gt; Jason Kidd * Scottie Pippen 1.90 SPG over 208 total playoff games - 6th all-time SPG (395 Total / 425 adjusted) * Magic &gt; Stockton &gt; Bird &gt; James  Other factors would include:  * 1st round series were best of five until 2003 when they were upped to best of seven. Every player on this list had less opportunity because of the format change.   * Sweeping a team would be held against you since it would limit the number of games played.   Really one could argue that Lebron has played so many playoff games because he has a hard time closing teams out and losing in the finals, but...I do respect what he's accomplished, and I don't 100% believe that. Seven straight finals appearances and three rings is nothing to sneeze at, but I'm not going to participate in fluffing the guy. I would have loved to have him join the Bulls in 2010 instead of consistent obliterating my team, but...come on.     "
"I'm arguing that you throw ""fit"" out the window if Lebron James says he wants to play for your basketball team.   You just make that shit work. "
This part is a bit much. I think he's just a smaller player so he has a harder time with cross court swing passes.  LeBron and James are constantly telegraphing passes but they also have shooters that make them look good. WB is constantly finding creative ways to get Adams the ball especially.
Paul George is a feast or famine type of player. He regualrly goes through month long stretches of playing horribly mixed in with stretches of being all-NBA caliber. LeBron never has games like Paul George's game 6 against Utah.  LeBron James is pretty much always a great player and with a rim protector like Embiid he would be an excellent fit. LeBron is worse at defense at this stage but even a diminished LeBron is infinitely better than PG. Sixers would have a better team around him than he has had since Miami possibly (depends who they lose to sign him) so LBJs decline would be slower than it would be otherwise probably.

"they really should rename the Eastern Conference Championship thing they give out to the ""Lebron James award"""
"I understand taking more money, but I wonder if having a lackluster career  to talent ratio does for other money. Such as endorsements and sneaker deals.   I could see Lebron James taking less money in Miami working out for him because he got more (or any) rings and to boot all the glory and fame that comes with it.   Meanwhile Carmelo is maxing out contracts and playing with pretty shit teams and coasting. Surely Lebron will have plenty of opportunities after the NBA based on his legacy, where I can see Carmelo becoming another Iverson after the NBA."
"Nah, but if I did that would be irrelevant here. Probably me and that to say you think I’m a LeBron James hair when in fact I’m actually a fan of the guy and I think it’s a freak athlete and he’s one of the most enjoyable basketball players to watch play... that being said, professional sports are simply entertainment. Just like the WWE, the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB etc. are all part of the sports entertainment enterprise. Players make millions of dollars if not more year. If your boss tells you the other team is winning the series in this many games you’re going to listen to them because your contract depends on it. It’s really not that complicated. Why do you think the greatest player in the world (or any NBA player) would make[this](https://youtu.be/GEijr7iki4o) mistake? I’m pretty sure LeBron could make 100 laps in a row or he could’ve simply just dunked the ball. Most likely did so because that’s what he was told to do..."

"&gt; LeBron James gets 7 appearences, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant 5, Reggie Miller, Paul Pierce and Robert Horry 3.  Skip Bayless is somewhere right now ranting about how this is wrong and LBJ is not clutch."
"I definitely respect Oladipo for turning the ship around after last year, but they were essentially dominated by LeBron James and a ragtag bunch of non-scorers. Not sure I have much more respect for the Pacers because they are still at the mercy of one man who has no clear number two, and no one on the team scored more than 12 PPG aside from James. "
"Since my first post to you, I did some research and found that Jordan just actually shot more than James, and that's the reason for the discrepancy.  Jordan averaged something like 26 shots, while LeBron averaged something like 21.  The PPS was virtually identical.  In any case, we're talking tiny sample sizes here, and the career playoff stats of LeBron and Jordan are very similar."

The Pacers are a very good team who have beaten top teams. The Raptors are a top team. They're on a different level, and if the Cavs want to win, they're going to need much better performances by everyone not called LeBron James. If they get that, the series is going to be very tense. If not, it's going to be short."

I'm not even going to hide it.  The finals would be better if it was HOU vs CLE.  Harden vs James.  New School vs Old School.  GS should lose to HOU in semi-conf finals behind Harden while Lebron carrying his team on his back to the Finals.
It goes both ways. Lebron James and Kevin Love were called for 4 fouls in Game 1 and Kyrie Irving 3 fouls. In Game 3 Kyrie Irving was called for 5 fouls.  In Game 4 Kevin Love was given a flagrant foul for this after Durant complained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiUUfDbCnhQ  
"Lebron on AI and MJ:  “He represented what black kids were all about, and he resonated with every inner-city kid in the world who had a struggle,” LeBron James says. “Michael Jordan inspired me, and I looked up to him, but he[AI] was out of this world. A.I. was really the god.” via sports illustrated"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"LeBron looks like LeBron James, the small forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat in the 2000s and 2010s."

Having shaq at at the age kobe was or having scottie pippen is not more help than a prime wade and a prime bosh. That's just nuts dood. I'll say lebron's 3rd ring is a more difficult situation than kobe and mj faced in the finals but kobe's 2010 finals is actually really close to it in difficulty and the thunder just before the cavs almost beat that warriors team who seemed depleted from the season.     Off the bat, in real life mj and kobe did better than lebron. Just admit it. Your whole argument isn't grounded in what actually happened. If you were to look at lebron's stats and see he had a team with prime wade and prime bosh you would never guess he'd lose to the mavericks but low and behold, Sorry bro it has to be tragic, but I guess you can play video games with lebron james in them and be coached by phil jackson and play with scottie pippen or something.

This was a deliberate referee rule twisting to help the Warriors. No call you want to complain about in favor of the Cavs is bad as this. Do you have an excuse for this? It's indefensible.

In Game 4 Kevin Love was given a flagrant foul for this after Durant complained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiUUfDbCnhQ  It was rigged for the Warriors! The refs won the game!

LeBron James and his Boy
"&gt; No, they're not worth more when it comes to the outcome; but it's evidence that points towards the dominance of one team and the lack of strength of another.  Does dominance in specific games in the series matter if you don't win 4? No, you lose the series no matter how dominant your wins are  &gt; Right, they couldn't stop LeBron James. They could stop everyone else on the team but him. That is exactly my point.  And Lebron James is on the Cavs, the Cavs have an unstoppable player. That gives them a big advantage over the Pacers, who do not have an unstoppable player, that is exactly my point.   &gt; It matters when they're down 20 because his team is trash.  Doesn't matter how many times your down 20 in a series as long as you get 4 wins. As I said, when Lebron sees a game as an obvious loss he takes it easy.   &gt; I look at it like this. Let's say you have on A++ level player, 1 B level player, and 14 C/D level players. Your average is still going to be a C, no matter how good that A++ level player is. He is going to get you wins because he is just that good, but the overall level of that team is still a C/D. Now look at the other team, which has 1 A- level player, and 14 B/C level players. Your average is going to be somewhere around a B or C. Higher than the average of the other team, but that A++ still dicks you around like it's nothing; sometimes that results in wins.  You're not understanding me, I completely agree with what your saying. Lebron is the best player in the series by far, and his teammates aren't very good, and the Pacers have a bunch of solid players.   The problem is, when you are measuring one team vs the other, especially in basketball, the ""average grade"" of all of their players means jack shit. In baseball, football, hockey, where one player doesn't have as much of an impact on the game, I would totally agree with your logic. Look at the Los Angeles Angels the past couple of years. They have the consensus best player in baseball, yet they continue to miss the playoffs often. The MVP of basektball however, is often a top 2 top 3 seed of his conference. Because in basketball, having the best player on your team is a huge advantage to your team. One player has such a bigger influence on the game than other sports.   The Pacers win the ""best average grade of their players award"", the Cavs win the best team award because they have Lebron freaking James on their team.   &gt;sometimes that results in wins.  4/7 wins to be precise, which is how many it takes to win the series.  "
"Bruh maybe I phrased it wrong. It's more 'random all-stars', or ones whose games just don't compliment each other.  Russ and Melo doesn't work in any world. Both need the rock all the time. I honestly think if the Melo trade hadn't happened you would have seen a much better team.  Also when Russ had those players he went to the finals with them when they were all under 22years-old. Unfortunately they met a LeBron James who was on a mission to get his first ring. Russ clearly shown he's an incredible player."
"&gt;  You can't look at each game of a 7 game series in a vacuum and be like ""They won these ones by more so that's worth more!""  No, they're not worth more when it comes to the outcome; but it's evidence that points towards the dominance of one team and the lack of strength of another.   &gt; And how did that work out for the Pacers? Oh, it didn't, they couldn't stop the best player in the world when it mattered, so they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers.  Right, they couldn't stop LeBron James. They could stop everyone else on the team but him. That is exactly my point.  &gt; When it comes down to it, when Lebron is iso-ing on you down the stretch, going 1v1 vs bogdanovic, does it really matter how shitty his teammates are when he bowls to the rim and gets the two points?  It matters when they're down 20 because his team is trash.  I look at it like this. Let's say you have on A++ level player, 1 B level player, and 14 C/D level players. Your average is still going to be a C, no matter how good that A++ level player is. He is going to get you wins because he is just that good, but the overall level of that team is still a C/D.   Now look at the other team, which has 1 A- level player, and 14 B/C level players. Your average is going to be somewhere around a B or C. Higher than the average of the other team, but that A++ still dicks you around like it's nothing; sometimes that results in wins."

"lmao no way lebron used to yell ""king james"" after dunking on someone"
Dwight Howard is the one of the only players to lead his team past LeBron James in the playoffs without later having LeBron defeat him so yes. 
http://hoopshype.com/2014/06/10/how-do-you-defend-lebron-james/  This article sounds far from pure hatred.
"&gt;The Cavs production as a whole has been garbage, don’t blame it all on LeBron especially when the best Cavs lineup has LeBron in it, the reason why he’s a net negative the first time ever in his career this season is because your starting 5 consists of two players consistently playing poorly.   Ehhh no.   First, Kevin Love has been very effective this season.  Second, Lebron James has been atrocious defensively this season. The starters, in general, are playing poorly defensively, but Lebron James' performance is unacceptable at the four spot. Yes, Kevin Love has clearly been better than Bron on that end.  Third, The top 2 two-man lineup, (To specify which player's causing the positive) does not contain Lebron James.   &gt;He doesn’t have to be the MVP to be the best player in the world, and i personally think it’s too early to call it quits (especially on your own team). I’d definitely wait for the playoffs before I say anything, we literally hear the same chatter about the Cavs every year.  I think Lebron is in the MVP discussion. I have not quit on my team either lol.  But he's not even close to playing like the best player in the world.   Harden, Curry, Durant, and Giannis.  "
I wonder what it feels like to experience rooting for a good team (in any sport lol). Patting myself on the back for not being a bandwagon fan probably doesn't feel better than just pretending to be a fan of the Warriors or following LeBron James or whatever. Maybe I'll just become a 76ers fans or something.   Life isn't fair :(
"You think so?  Once again, I have no idea how there's a narrative that Lebron,himself, took the Warriors to 6 games.  Cavs' defense in those two games really, really stepped up. I mean they allowed only 92 points per game for the Warriors in their two wins; they averaged 110 in the regular season. Lebron was certainly not the reason they played well defensively.   I think Lebron's brilliance was creating looks for his teammates while he was slashing... but his own inefficiency in isolation haunted Cavs as they had an awful offensive rating.   Did I mention Lebron's horrid clutch stats in that series? The series had five games that went to ""clutch time"" (Total of 21 minutes)   And Lebron had 17 points in 40% TS with 2 assists.   Did I mention Matthew really stepped up defensively?  I think Warriors had a good chance of winning in 2015 even with Irving and Love, but I think Warriors had zero chance of losing in 2016 if Bogut didn't go down. You have to remember, Bogut was one of the best defenders in the league that year, and protected the rim at an elite level. (Lead the league in DRPM btw: http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2016/sort/DRPM)  Bron averaged 25/11/8 (6 TO) with 53.5% TS when Bogut was playing.   Bron averaged 36/12/10 (3 to) with 59% TS when he was out  I should mention: I 100% think Lebron deserved his ring, but I am saying comments like:  ""Lebron James' legacy was seriously bolstered by 2016 finals""   is garbage.   That finals was worth one championship, nothing more nothing less. You cannot tell me he put his name in to GOAT conversation because he ""beat a 72 win team in the playoffs"". I see people use this Finals in comparison to MJ, ALL THE TIME; It's literal shit.   Lebron did not beat a 72 win team in the finals that year. That team was a shell of themself. "
"No one really does but that was one of those Heat teams' biggest strengths so I don't know if that's really what I'd point to as the biggest issue.  James, Wade, and Battier were all very good perimeter defenders at the time. Bosh was never a great rim protector but was the backbone of that defense with his ability to hedge and recover. Even Chalmers was a pretty solid defender.  I think it'd just come down to depth really. Looking back at those Heat rosters, they really only went 5 or 6 deep with guys that could keep up on both ends of the floor. With LeBron at the peak of his athleticism though, they might put up a decent fight, especially if we assume Wade is still relatively close to his peak."

"It felt like Rosen was going out of his way to detract from Lebron as much as possible. Like he walked in there and was like ""Fuck this kid."" The last paragraph of that article is great:   &gt;""After the media hysteria dies down, after his arrogance is reduced to real humility, he might very well develop into a franchise player. But let's not reserve a wing in the Hall of Fame for LeBron James just yet."""
"&gt;In high school, LeBron James might be a man among boys -- but in the NBA, he'll be a boy among men. Skilled, experienced, powerful, and above all, ruthless men.  fucking lol"
COCKED BY JAMES!   LEBRON JAMES WITH THE EJACULATION!
"He was also incredibly developed as a basketball player by the age of 16, so it was easy to see his strengths. Most players (including Jordan) develop into good basketball players a bit later into their lives. James was a savant at his age, you can just go back and watch his high school videos, and compare them to say, Russell Westbrook's. You can see the LeBron we know in his high school self, not so much with Russell. "
"Lol this guys Twitter feeds reads like an angry drunk 13 year old. And LeBron most certainly does not demand to be called King James by anyone ahahahah this guy is a nut. In the scouting report he even admitted he had potential to be a franchise player, he just exaggerated all his weaknesses heavily. How can one be simultaneously an excellent passer and selfish? "
"Here's what I said in another thread:  Holy shit, this guy (Charley Rosen) is the original LeBron hater. This article actually shocked me for how willing it was to straight up insult a high school player. This guy clearly didn't care about LeBron's basketball skills - he didn't like him personally, and simply wanted to insult him for his perceived ""arrogance."" Who's laughing now, Mr. Rosen? Remind me to never touch one of your books.  Ten years later, he was still out for blood:  https://twitter.com/charleyrosen1?lang=en  ""LBJ is still a jerk no matter how many titles he wins - still refers to himself and asks others to do the same as King James - ugh!!""  This alone proves that LeBron's basketball skills were never the problem to Rosen. He just hates the man, and has hated him since he was a young teenager."
"&gt; Better talent at the top. While the Cavs have the best player in the world, the Warriors have the 2 next best. And then they have 2 other all-NBA players  Look, I am all for Bron and shit.   But if you think Lebron has been the best player in the world this year, we are watching a completely different ball game. The reason we stood no chance against GS was that we CLEARLY didn't have the best player in the league. Maybe that can change in the playoffs, but calling Lebron James the best player right now is like calling Kobe the best player in 2013; Both absolutely deluded statements.   When Lebron is on the court, we are a fucking NEGATIVE team. His defense has been one of the worst I have ever seen for a superstar... I have watched Harden play since his rookie seasons btw. If Lebron was the best player in the world, there's no fucking way we are a -.1 team when he's on the floor.   For me, Curry, Harden, KD, and Giannis are having some insane seasons that deserve more credit. "
"Shannon Sharpe is one of the biggest LeBron James stans I have ever seen. He rarely says anything intelligent; well, to be fair, the whole show is unintelligent. They somehow managed to take First Take and miraculously found a way to make it worse.  "
"Pierce and the Celtics were also playing really well against Lebron and they were the last team to cause real problem to James in the eastern conference so I guess that is what he was refering to. If Pierce was the same age as Lebron in 2012, it's likely that Lebron don't get his ring that year"
"I feel they are grumpy about LeBron.   'Before LeBron, we competed for championships, and only celebrated banners.'   Since King James has owned the Eastern Conference for the past decade, being the last one to lose something has started to mean something.  But a part of me agrees with Rondo for wondering if it ever should. Ten, twenty years from now ITs amazing, heartbreaking season will be lost amongst the fodder of more familar players doing greater things.   The organization just has a history of great basketball. "
Lebron James Harden
"*LeBron James, top 5 coach in the NBA"
"Lebron looked deep into my eyes with that deep longing gaze. He leans in and whispers “I need you”. We leave the game to go out to the parking lot It was just us, we were alone. He bends me over his Kia and fills me with his love. He grabbed my big balls and I moaned “what an assist by James” he was at least 3 quarters in and I was exhausted but he kept going and going. He’s in all 4 quarters now everything’s on the line. He attacks my rim with all of his force. I can tell it’s almost over and with only 30 seconds left in me. He gives me all he has and gives me one thrust as he screams “here cums James” he steps back and fires away at my rim as he lands a direct shot."
Well too bad.. the general consensus is that KD is the second best player behind LeBron James. You curry fans can keep that bs in your cult.

"I dunno man. There's too many what-ifs to really say. Like, the entire Cleveland roster was built to counter the Spurs, so when another power rose in the west it was inevitable that they were going to be struggling. That being said, I think with better personnel decisions he would be in the position to form a superteam ala the Heatles. This is LeBron fucking James we're talking about here. It's hard to imagine that he doesn't have the recruiting ability to get someone better than JR + TT for ~33 mil.  It's not necessarily something you can fault him for, as these Warriors are an insanely tough team that would take near-perfect execution from both management and players to defeat, but it's just humorous how LeBron has often failed in the process of attempting to control his own destiny. It's not something that hurts him in the 'great player' conversation - he's top 5 all time, no argument. But it might hurt vs MJ."
"Don't forget about the unrealistic trade proposals and the ""can five clones of Mugsy Bogues beat one LeBron James wearing flip flops"" nonsense."
"I'm sorry but you're just desparatly grasping at straws and missing the forrest for the trees. A switch heavy defense can be deployed by anyone. It doesn't take special skills. And what it ignores is that no amount of ""switch heavy defense"" from Biyombo Bazemore and Middleton is going to make up for the fact that you are going up against the most gifted, athletic mobile shooting scoring powerhouse of a big man ever to play the game. Against a team where any one of their players can not only defend their position but score from ANYWHERE on the floor.   You need to go toe to toe with that powerhouse. You need someone who can defend him downlow and force him to shoot from outside. You need someone who can guard his driving cutting outlets who are two time MVP's and NBA champions. That person can't all be Lebron James. You need someone who can get to the hoop and score on him. That person can't all be Lebron James.   You need someone like Marc Gasol or Demarcus Cousin or Porzingis. You don't seem to understand that the Golden State Warriors and Kevind Durrant have broken this league with a juggernaut that can't be beaten with conventional defenses. You need superstars to match up with that kind of superstardom.   Your suggestion would indeed increase the Cavs defensive abilities but your suggestion takes pound for pound 1 point of offense for every point of defense you gain. The net result is zero. And probably a little bit negative.   "
"Honeslty, I don't mean to be mean, but there is no future in Cleveland. Cavs should put everything into now while they have Lebron James."
I actually think Cleveland has a better bench than us. Our bench struggles so hard at creating shots and spacing the floor and that's why Kerr usually have two starters out with the bench to start the second quarter. I think Andre's decline has contributed to our bench production falling off as well because he's just not confident enough to take the open shot. And McCaw hasn't actually progress as much as I'd like. Our bench does contribute in ways other than scoring though since a lot of our bench players are decent defenders.  The interesting thing about Cleveland is that a lot of their worst lineups include LeBron James and their current starting lineup is -30 over 54 minutes. Their best line up is the one with Jose Calderon and the other 4 starters when they went on that win streak. And I wonder if they might go back to that with IT coming off the bench like he did earlier in his career.
"I agree he's not a better basketball player than LeBron or KD. I think that's at least in part due  to their sizes. Curry will never be top 5 in blocks because of his size. He can't guard 5 positions because of his size. So all things being equal, I take LBJ and KD over him.   That being said, one could argue that Curry has a bigger impact on any one game than either of the two others. His gravity is real. His ability to score from outside the arc is unbelievable. There's something to be said for that.  The argument for swapping players is futile. The teams aren't constructed in such ways. If you want to argue KD vs Kawhi for example, sure let's swap teams. But swapping James and Curry doesn't make sense. If we instead build a team from the ground up around either of these two, then we can objectively ask which player is more valuable to his team's success, or which player contributes at a greater rate to his team's success."
"If you can find me three examples of racism by a Boston fan on this sub, I'll make my flair LeBron James for a week. "
"At this point, I am just ready to move on from IT. Dude did a lot of incredible shit here that will not be forgotten and will always be appreciated but the repeatedly voicing how betrayed he feels about being traded to the media over and over again is unprofessional and immature. We traded KG, Paul, and Rondo a few years ago, we can certainly trade him. Also, it's not like we shipped him to a shitty situation. We sent him to play with LeBron fucking James. We sent him somewhere he can succeed.   "
"I still remember getting into an argument with a friend of mine at the time, who was angry because LeBron had been ruled ineligible by the Ohio State Athletic Association because the family had accepted like $800 worth of gifts from someone.  He felt like it was another example of the breakdown in amateur athleticism, and called James a greedy high school kid trying to cash in on fleeting fame, and ""guaranteed"" that LeBron would be a bust in the NBA.  (Side note: This is also a guy who was excited when the Celtics gave a ""real blue chip talent and guaranteed double-double guy"" like Mark Blount a big contract extension)  Every once in a while I'll bring it up, and he always responds with something like ""LeFraud?  Every time he goes to the basket he flails, throws the ball away, and then looks for a foul.  And the refs ALWAYS give it to him!""  Yeah, that definitely describes LeBron James..."

"""LeBron James revealed to be an alien specimen from space"""
"The article makes a great point in saying the real (and probably insurmountable) problem is GS. I just don't see literally any way the Cavs can contend with this Warriors team. They can come out of the East for as long as they want but at the end Golden State is better in almost every way -  1. Better talent at the top. While the Cavs have the best player in the world, the Warriors have the 2 next best. And then they have 2 other all-NBA players  2. Better talent at the bottom - their bench is one of the best in the league and even their draft pick (Bell) has turned out to provide phenomenal value  3. Better talent maximization - The Warriors have a better coaching staff and a better system. They have a system with more ball movement and player involvement. This allows for greater exploitation of opposing defenses and stops the offense from stagnating.  4. Way better defense. The Cavs just don't have the personnel. The Warriors do. KD has become a fantastic rim protector, Draymond is a terrific organizer and a former DPOY, Bell has outperformed expectations. They are also very good on the perimeter.  5. Chemistry. The Warriors are in sync. They play with a great sense of chemistry. They look like they have fun each night and most players probably feel like they are valuable assets to the team. On the other hand, the Cavs are in clear disarray. IT is having trouble being integrated and Love is underperforming and/or being incorrectly utilized. Their role players for the most part suck. TT sucks. Shump sucks. JR sucks. This leads to frustration on and off the court and hurts chemistry.  I still think Lebron on his own is good enough to get by the Celtics without Hayward and the Raptors this year, but their odds at another East banner are more dubious than ever. This is the first year I wouldn't be surprised to see Lebron not make it to the Finals. And even if they do, they will be subject to yet another thrashing at the hands of GS. I don't see any move they could make with their limited assets that could end up being enough for the Cavs to beat GS. Get Deandre? GS is still better. Get PG? I still think GS is heavily favored. This GS team is probably the best team ever from a team building perspective. They were able to homegrow the majority of their talent, use their cap flexibility to sign big free agents, and filled out their roster with capable ring chasers. You rarely see a superteam work this well in sports. For that reason I think Lebron leaves because this Cleveland squad has left their best days with James in the past."
"They are ranked highly because they dominated their era and set records that may never be broken (best player on a championship team for Russell, stats for Chamberlain).  It's unfair to speculate about whether they would be as dominant today.  The question usually asked is how dominant players were in their own eras, because that's the only question we can try to answer.  By that standard, they are appropriately ranked in the top ten.  If you want to discount their ranking because of the era in which they played, you can, but will you do the same for everyone?  It's been a long time since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Jordan dominated the league, perhaps they should both be ranked behind LeBron James and Tim Duncan."

"This is the underrated aspect of their run. They've had players such as Justin Holliday, Pat McCaw, Ian Clark, Jordan Bell, James McAdoo all play significant minutes for them during their runs. If they had some picks to invest in younger players or obtained some younger players to develop alongside the roster during that first year, they'd be in a much better spot. They are basically in the Heat's position before LeBron left."
"I've always liked [this scouting report](http://www.espn.com/page2/s/rosen/021213.html), which includes gems such as ""LeBron James can't guard his own shadow"" that he has a ""barely adequate left hand,"" and that ""after his arrogance is reduced to real humility, he might very well develop into a franchise player."""
"They had an operating loss but the value of the team is almost double what it was since Lebron came back.  &gt;All NBA team values are up dramatically thanks to the league's $24 billion TV deal signed in 2014, but the Cavaliers' jump has outpaced the league by 18%. Forbes valued the team No. 19 in the NBA at $515 million before the return of King James and $1.1 billion last year, 12th highest in the league. The value of the team is up again this year after the 2016 title.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/01/27/how-lebrons-cavaliers-lost-an-nba-high-40-million-last-season/#67b1d2557699  So no, in the grand scheme, he'd likely be saving money on the roster while the value of his team tanks if Lebron leaves."
Lol maybe if they had Hayward I’d be worried about a 7 game series. This team is relying on a rookie and a sophomore to help take down lebron James. I’d be very surprised if the series goes to 6
Lebron James puts asses in seats. A tanking/rebuilding Cavs team will not make him more money.

"Why would he do that when he can just go to whatever team he wants in July?  If the team he wants to go to doesn't have the cap space to sign him this summer, they'd have to get rid of contracts now to do so. That team (and LeBron) would only want to get rid of bad contracts and it would make no sense for the Cavs to even entertain the idea of taking them on. They'd rather just let LeBron leave for nothing.  For example, let's say he demands a trade to the Lakers. The Lakers have two big expiring deals in Lopez and Caldwell-Pope to be traded, but the Cavs wouldn't bite without a draft pick. Not wanting to attach another pick and knowing that LeBron wants to sign in LA anyway, why would the Lakers swing a trade now? The current team with LeBron doesn't take them to the finals, and they know they have the cap space to sign him in summer.   Let's say he wants to go to Houston instead. Chris Paul and James Harden are untouchable. What would the Cavs do with Ryan Anderson or Eric Gordon, both of whom have two more fully-guaranteed years on their deals after this one?"

"In light of that, the [NBA advanced stats leaders](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018_leaders.html) are fairly interesting. LeBron is tied for #1 in Box Plus Minus (10.3) with James Harden. Tied for #2 in Win Shares (7.8) with Giannis, behind Harden (8.0). And LeBron is #1 in Value-Over-Replacement-Player (4.9) with Westbrook as #2 (4.2). Raw +/- has him in the negative, but the advanced (BPM, WS, VORP) stats all have him in MVP candidate land.   Look at the [Cavs as a whole](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2018.html), Kevin Love is literally the only other Cav with positive Box Plus Minus. Except for Love (1.1), Korver (0.4) and Wade (0.2), the rest of the team is at replacement level. "
"Yeah, by LeBron James, who if you haven't learned yet, has been to the Finals 7 years in a row.  Look at all the other teams that lost to LeBron in the Eastern Finals: 2011 Chicago Bulls (4-1), 2012 Boston Celtics (4-3), 2013 Indiana Pacers (4-3), 2014 Indiana Pacers (4-2), 2016 Toronto Raptors (4-2) and 2017 (4-1).  The sweep matters very little. However, I remember that Love and Irving were both out in that series, which helped the Hawks out a bit. Hawks lost their best perimeter player in Korver after the second game and it didn't help much that Millsap and Horford were playing a bit injured that series, but had to play to give the team a chance.  Of course, they rained 3's on the Hawks which isn't a shocker. Hawks only had 1 competent perimeter defender that season with Carroll. If the Hawks offense sputters, which it will do when Horford and Millsap are playing injured and of course get outworked on the glass and Korver not being available after game 2, it really hurts the Hawks' offense.  But in the end, the sweep in the playoffs is irrelevant compared to the history that lineup made for that team."

What the hell is a quick little tribute video for a player who had one of the most legendary Celtic seasons in their history during his player introduction on his return back as an active player? Whats next? Paul Pierce is going to have a problem with the Cavs being introduced on his night? because we all know he is bitter as fuck about Lebron James.  
The best player in the world is lebron James my guy 
"Terry ""Lebron 'Michael Jordan' James"" Rozier"
Be coach of LeBron James.   Do real good.   Get fired.    Feels bad man. 
"You gotta get Lonzo Ball because I want to see ""Coach"" LeBron vs. ""Coach"" Lamar.  Just kidding. I like James and Lonzo and the two don't need that noise."
Get rid of the max salary cap on contracts and let teams really fight for superstars. This will create way more parity in the end and make the league more fun for the fans. Should Mike Conley and Lebron James have the same paycheck?
Spurs. If LeBron James goes to the spurs and they magically retain LMA and Leonard (shift to SG bring danny off the bench?) they are instant serious contenders imo.
"Fournier? Bazemore? Bellinelli? Middleton? AND getting rid of Love? I'm sorry but this is a whole lot of work for nothing. I don't know how to spell it out to people but the Golden State Warriors have Steph Curry AND Kevin Durant AND Draymond Green AND Klay Thompson. The only player on that list you mentioned that's better than ANY ONE of those players is Lebron James. Now granted Lebron James is the best player in the league and can still drag dead weight to the finals but all of those trades are just punting pennies.   The Cavaliers can be helped by one thing and one thing only. A superstar. That's the only thing that will compete with the Warriors or even the superstar stacked Rockets.   Kevin Durant broke the league when he moved to the warriors no amount of trading pawns can beat that team. The Cavs needed to keep Kyrie Irving AND sign one of the major free agents over the offseason to have any chance of beating the Warriors. They could have done it but Irving screwed them over. Butler, Paul, Anthony, George. There were so many players looking to join a championship team and Irving steered them all elsewhere. Griffin tried to prevent from happening but the Cavs ownership wasn't having it. Instead they signed more old dead weight in Rose and Wade.   I think a big error in your judgment is that you seem to think the problem for the Cavs who have JR, Korver, Green, Frye, Shumpert and Wade is that they need more wings.  Their only chance at this point is to sign an allstar big man. Jordan wants out of LA so I don't know why they're not throwing everything they have at him. They've got plenty of talented pieces to throw around to get him.   There's another talented big man in Greg Monroe and they should be throwing everything they have at aquring him if they can't get Jordan.   Gasol or Cousins are other players who would allow them to beat the Warriors. Big, scoring, shooting, defending athletic big men who can compete against Durant Green for the paint.  And they've got to hope and pray that IT can get his legs under him and he and Lebron can figure out how to share the ball and capitalize on both of their talents. Because by the looks of it it's not happening any time soon.   Barring that the Warriors are walking to another championship.   TLDR:  Fournier, Middleton, Bazemore and Biyombo are gonna add jacksquat but confusion and a steep learning curve for the cavs. And losing Love gets rid of your only tradeable asset AND your pick which is your only hope for a rebuild for what amounts to a big fat zero.

"Their offense is a lot better than their defense, but from what I have seen the offense is still stale. I'll preface that by saying I'm judging the ""staleness"" by Championship contender standards, they are clearly above average. Also, I've only caught a few of their games (plus highlights) so if you follow them closely I'll defer to your insight.   What I'm seeing is that LeBron &amp; Co can get their buckets and they can get red hot at times, but their offense involves a lot of players standing around. This is what I mean by a stale offense. It's predictable and not that dynamic, it just happens that they have LeBron James running it so it's not terrible. In my experience though, a stale offense leads to the uninvolved players not giving 100% on defense.   There is all the talent necessary for them to win a championship, but I don't know how that happens if they don't adjust what they are doing. If I am being unfair in that assessment let me know, I'm just calling it like I see it."

You don't go from 3rd in Rebound % to 23 in Rebound % in a year being locked in.   The most telling stat is PIE they went from 5th in the NBA to 13th. The combination of players they put together are not jelling and making the other players better. They are not playing team ball, playing for each other, playing as a unit. It's Lebron James and the rest of the team. Look at how LeBron as a point-forward causes the ball to stick to one side of the court at crucial spots in the game. No, trades are not the answer. They have great pieces. Better coaching and team play is the answer."

"Maybe he'll know all the stuff that gets under Stephs' skin and can throw him off his game.   &gt; Also they could run a lineup of Curry, Thompson, Green, Love and LeBron James.  Good shit post"
With LeBron James lol. He put up 36/8/5 last year and the Raps lost their best LeBron defender. OG's great but he ain't gonna do any better than PJ. And sure the Raps and deeper and spread it around more but the matters much less in the playoffs. It still comes down to individual dominance and LeBron is the ultimate trump card. Plus they have IT. He's no Kyrie but he'll get buckets once he gets his groove

"no  lebron was dominant up until the start of this month, lebron even looked better in the warriors games for the most part  there's a reason why curry and durant haven't been talked about as an MVP maybe up until recently, and that's because james and harden were dominating up until recently"
"LeBron with the - 33, I know we don’t say much about him because he is LeBron James after all, but he needs to be called out for his poor offense and poor defense lately, which coincides more with the losing streak that TT or IT returning. Previously his insane offensive production excused and masked his defense, but now what he is shooting poorly from everywhere, it becomes a bigger issue.   Also, people continues to have a boner for Frye/Cedi. I've always said they are good in short spurts (like 4-5 minutes here and there) but not good enough/too flawed to take on a solid rotation role. People got all super excited because Frye was +10 in 2 minutes and silent when it reverted to normal at +2 in 4 minutes. Yes he did well while he was playing on the defensive end but his gravity is overstated here.    Rose looked great again. So glad he’s playing well and I hope anyone talking shit and saying he would be bad for the cavs just because of advanced stats from earlier in the season learns their lesson.    Lastly, I believe the issues on the Cavs are defensive effort and the issues aren’t something solved by the coach or trades, it’s on the players themselves and all the players in fact. Claiming a trade or firing the coach or blaming a scapegoat would solve things is just excuses. In fact, people will simply be disappointed if they make a trade or get a new coach and the actual issue persists. Lue is right, the team's issues isn't on one player and switching whoever out won't magically save things but people love to misconstrue what he says into scared to hurt someone’s feelings. Improving their defense is a team effort and it will have to start with LeBron James.     Also, some smaller notes. Great to see crowder have a good game and its clear IT is making him a lot better. IT also had a good game but it’s still apparent that his magic from last season isn't there yet. Not sure how much of that he can get back again, but hope it keeps getting better."

Nobody's saying he's LeBron James here, but if that is your standard of ""garbage"", I don't know what more you expect him to do."

Yes, if the suns can get Lebron James for a first round pick, it will happen. LOL  But that's not AT ALL what we are talking about.   It's very rare for a rebuilding team to trade away their picks when the value is received is similar; THAT was the context we were talking about as well (Austin Rivers for a second round pick)"

You didnt fucking said that he possibly shouldnt be on those lists either. Which is fucking stupid because he actually fucking won those awards anyway. Which is why your fucking list is stupid if you dont include KD and Curry no matter how great they are doing just because they are on the same team because Lebron fucking James won two fucking MVPs with Wade and Bosh on his fucking team. 
"It will be great cause it might put a spark in last games. Were nearing all star game and there is still no clear cut candidates for MVP. Harden injury, LeBron turnover and 3p percentage slump regressed them now Curry and KD might win it.  Also Boston might get their candidate considering they have by far most wins in East, Kyrie could get some type of Steve Nash MVP maybe if Boston get to 60+ wins.  Last year before new years eve you had three horse race with clear cut competitors Kawhi, WB and Harden with LeBron as wildcard because everybody knew James will cruise to playoffs.  And soon before all star break it was a two horse race with Brodie and Beard. Even at ASG they were interviewed about eachother and MVP race."
Trae young should be the first pick.  Ayton looks like a bust  Fultz is a bust  LeBron James is not the best player and hasn't been since Currys mvp season
"Article is normally paywalled but unlocked for today. Long, but a good read.   &gt;	“What you're seeing in Houston now is really Mike and Daryl together — Daryl's belief in the math combined with Mike's vision for basketball and spacing,” Kerr said. “That's the team that is culminating the last decade plus of this revolution.”  &gt;	Kerr took over the Warriors before the 2014-15 season. He inherited a Steph-centric offense that ran a ton of high screens. The Warriors were in the bottom half of the league in passes per game. He surveyed the roster, saw some untapped skills and let his inner Popovich begin strategizing.  &gt;	”I came in thinking a lot about what good passers we had with our bigs — (Andrew) Bogut and David Lee,” Kerr said. “Didn't know how good Draymond was yet. But I knew I wanted to diversify the offense.”  &gt;	The Spurs had just disposed of LeBron James' Heat in the Finals, demoralizing Miami in five quick games with an incredible blend of passing from all five spots.  &gt;	“That's the team that we mirror most closely (right now) — the Spurs championship team in 2014,” Kerr said. “There's this beautiful mix of passing and shooting. But that team wasn't Houston. That (Spurs) team had a lot of guys who were just so-so 3-point shooters, but they had so many playmakers. That's who we are. That's who we most closely resemble, I think.”"

I feel stupid for not having LeBron in there, but he'll be 38 in 2023 and even genetically superior humans have to slow down eventually. I think KD and Steph have games that will translate well into their mid-thirties. I also think DSJ will inherit Westbrook's soul and become the second coming.  "

"I really disagree with this. First off, Dan Gilbert is an idiot owner. He might be the nicest guy in the room but he's an idiot NBA owner. He traded Kyrie to the number 1 seed in the same conference and helped set the stage for the Celtics to be a possible dynasty with Kyrie. They didn't nearly get enough for how clutch Kyrie is.  Even if you said the Brooklyn pick is the first overall pick what are you going to do with a 20 year old Bagley? He won't be viable in a legit NBA playoff series for multiple years. When you have LeBron James you go for the championship. The Cavs are going straight back to the 15th seed once he leaves. Love won't be staying past his contract after LeBron leaves. The team has no other assists. The entire team is old and/or on terrible contracts.  Personally I don't think the Lakers are ready for LeBron they still need to develop more. I can see LeBron staying in Cleveland for 2 more seasons so trading the pick would be the best move in my opinion. The Cavs couldnt make the playoffs for 4 seasons after James left last time and they act like the Brooklyn pick is going to be their back up plan. The Nets might end the season with 8-10 teams below them. That pick could be completely worthless. They need some serious rim protection and guard/wing defense. Get the Cavs over the hump? All it takes is a Durant or Curry ankle injury during the playoffs and maybe the Cavs can steal another title from the Warriors. You take that risk. Why? For the fans. LeBron just turned 33, there's maybe 3-4 solid LeBron years left. Top Free Agents aren't going to go to Cleveland if LeBron leaves again. I'll go complete opposite as the OP, if you don't trade the pick then I think Gilbert is an idiot. The Cavs are going to suck for a decade until LeBron buys the team off Gilbert."

Removing those four would add the following players:  * Deandre Jordan * Lou Williams * Gordon Hayward * Steph Curry  There are more misses here than the BR list, but if you just look at how it predicts the younger players, which is a far tougher challenge, it does a lot better than BR did... Kawhi, Harden, Irving and George weren't household names at the time.  Obviously, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Towns, Lilliard or anyone drafted after summer 2011 can't be included here, but other omissions are as follows:  * Kyle Lowry (#33) * Demarcus Cousins (#38) * Lamarcus Aldridge (#42) * Demar Derozan (#139)  Jimmy Butler didn't play 1000 minutes in 11/12, but if he did, he'd be ranked 21."

"The only reasons that team has a ring is LeBron, as good as a FO it possibly is, the only reason it has a ring is because James felt a reason to bring one back to the land.

"""We need a f**king playmaker"" - LeBron James, Jan 2017.  Better late than never I guess."
"Most players get no say. VERY rarely they can get a ""no trade clause"" in their contract, meaning that they can veto any trades, but they are only given out rarely to players like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. But most players don't have them. I don't know how many there are out of 450 current NBA players, I would say maybe 3 players have no trade clauses. I could be wrong though.   Kemba IS the Hornet's best player, but they have also signed a number of pretty average players to very very large contracts, and as a result they are currently over the cap while still being a below average team (they lose more than they win, and are not going to make the playoffs). So, they need to get rid of those players and their contracts for more flexibility and to save some money. You generally only want to go over the cap when you're a team that is winning a lot of games. But bad contracts are very hard to get rid of, and to entice other teams to take those bad contracts, they are having to give up their best player. So they are essentially saying:  ""What we are doing now isnt working, and we don't expect to see long-term success with this team.

"I'm sorry, this is just retarded. The guy already won 5 championships. He went to the finals in his prime every single time there was another all star on the lakers. What you're saying is just completely asinine. And saying kobe falls into the 10-15 range on most peoples list is a completely made up statement. In fact the greatest players of all time in unison rank him above someone like lebron james who reddit seems to worship and put next to mj (who also says kobe is better) because he has padded individual stats and 3 championships with 3 all stars per run in comparison to 5 titles 2 all stars per title.     *Kobe at 21 years old had a series in the playoffs against the spurs amongst others in the western conference playoffs where he was bigger than shaq in his prime.*      "
Can't let the best player in the NBA just walk. Lebron James is cleavelands economy 
How tf are you going to say this lol? are we really not allowed to criticize players on what they say and how they act? Should it be purely on basketball skill alone? Because I guarantee you if u replace Lebron James with cousins everyone would be hating on him.  But a bunch of lebron fans think he can do no wrong  
"As much as I would love to agree with anything anti-LeBron, I'd have to say I think Chris Paul and possibly James Harden are worse than him. Not to say LeBron doesn't have his problems with flopping, getting butthurt and letting negative press get under his skin, but I can only think of CP3 and Harden as far as guys I wanted to literally punch in the face as hard as I possibly could."
By definition Lebron should win mvp every year. There is no player in the nba that is more valuable than lebron james and that cant be argued imo.
"I'm old and fortunate enough to have seen Jordan play live during his both 3 peats, saw prime Kobe/Shaq lakers circa 2000 and have watched 100% of Lebron's career.   I am a basketball fanatic (ballislife) and I believe that LBJ is the best individual player that I've ever seen.   Jordan was the best in an era that was pretty watered down.   Lebron is the best in an era that far surpasses anything MJ ever played in.  They are both insanely talented, but James is just a better overall player than Michael the way I see it.  "
Yes! He'll tank us so we get number 1 pick LeBron James Jr.
"You missing the point that the Cavs will be acquiring 2 vets who are hungry for a championship?  You don't think Kemba/Dwight would be motivated leaving Charlotte and getting a chance to win a ring with the best player in the world Lebron James?  Trust me people sleep on Kemba because he plays in Charlotte, if he was playing with Lebron he could easily fill the Kyrie role."
"Professional NBA player who is a multiple time all-star is lazy, according to Reddit user /u/swagdaddy912   Because of this, the Pelicans have decided to buyout his contract to rid their roster of a player who contributed nothing, thanks to one Reddit user's insightful comment.  Joel Embiid averages 4 turnovers a game in 10 less minutes with less rebounds and less points and everybody sucks his dick as the next superstar. Ben Simmons averages 4. LeBron James averages 4.4 turnovers.  Even Marc Gasol, considered a good passer for a big, averages 3 turnovers a game.  Congratulations on making yourself look ignorant."
LeBron James is a really good player.  Jason Tatum is only 19 and has great potential.  Steph Curry is a great 3 point shooter.  Cavs are old  Kevin Durant is also a good player  Russell Westbrook is an MVP and carried his team.  Since this seems like the only thing you can post on this subreddit I'm wondering what you guys think about this.

"You don't have to be a lawyer to understand logical fallicies. You learn about them before you ever graduate high school. LeBron just tried to make it about Barkley and his past mistakes rather than LeBron criticizing roster moves that he himself was pushing. We can all agree Barkley isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, [but even he realized what Lebron was doing:](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/01/charles-barkley-lebron-james-espn-radio-never-friends-nba-cavaliers)  &gt;I think when you don’t like the message, you just kill the messenger.

"I just don't see it. Ball is their PG of the future, and they are looking to go after guys like Lebron James and Paul George that can be on the floor at the same time as Ingram. They have been looking to trade Clarkson/Nance/Randle for awhile now, but I am not sure if Walker is the fit.  On the other hand, if they did do the trade, Walker/PG15/Ingram/James would be one of the best starting 4 in the league, at least on paper. Still not sure where Lonzo would fit.."
Lebron took a horrible step back to end the regulation of 2015 finals game 1 when he could’ve just layed it in. This led to Kyrie being injured in overtime and Cavs losing the finals. Are we ready to talk about how Lebron James is responsible for the Kyrie injury?
"&gt;for LeBron  An important distinction the person I replied to should have made. Bad for LeBron James and bad for an NBA player are two very different things  &gt;He would be fucking crucified  I doubt it. He plays for a much better team. A 10 game shooting slump would go relatively unnoticed, as the Warriors would probably go 8-2 or 7-3 in that span"
"Lmao, you'd say the same thing if he averaged 40+ and still lost. What's the difference, it's all just numbers. Shitty teams don't win championships, no matter if they have a Lebron James. Fucking hell."
"This is my first time perusing this thread and my god these trade proposals are awful. They don’t even make sense I can’t tell if people are trolling or just dumb.  That said here’s my proposal.  Nets get : Lebron James, Kevin Love, BKN first rounder  Cavs get: Tyler Zeller and Quincy Acy.  Who says no?"
"You're claiming a lot of things I never claimed. Most ridiculous is the complete and utter assumption that i assume ""just because I can't, no one can"".  I'm not ( and never have) argued against Bill Russell's legacy. I'm explaining a plausible hypothesis as to why in the light of a not very simple formula, Jordan is regarded as being greater than a man with more rings than fingers. Why exactly is Jordan regarded as greater than Bill Russell? How come it's consensus that Jordan is better? Is it because of stats? Why is Jordan objectively considered by the vast majority to be better than a man with as many titles, more MVPs, more allstar selections, more all nba selections in Kareem Abdul Jabbar? Why is Jordan regarded by most to be better than Wilt Chamberlain, a man with objectively better stats than him?  You can point to a number of things individually - Jordan has better stats than Russell, Jordan has more FMVPs than Kareem, Jordan has more rings than Wilt. But you'll not be applying a formula consistently, you'll be basically handpicking stats where Jordan is superior as reasons as to why they are superior. You could go for the ""Jordan has the best combination"", but that assessment would be filtered with your biases on how you weigh each season, each ring, scoring, stats, accolade etc etc etc. At the end of the day players are going to have areas in certain places where they are more superior than others, even the accepted GOAT. that's what makes player evaluations hard.  AT BEST you come to a conclusion that a player is probably better than another, or another player is beyond some doubt a better player than another. And what about as you go down the rankings? Between the players who have similar MVPs, stats, accolades?  That's before we even take into account that throughout it all in comparing rings and achievements, we are taking the assumption that all rings are equal, that all scoring seasons are equal, that the pace of the game is equal. Because if they are not, and they aren't, it becomes harder to compare a 30ppg scoring season from a fast paced era to a 24 ppg scoring season from a slower paced era. Then there's the inflation in efficiency.  So do pray tell, when I've made it so clear how hard it is to compare players from different eras who have dominated their respected era in different ways, WHY is Jordan regarded by most as the GOAT? HOW can it be that there are better accomplishing men in almost every regard that yet in most people's opinion it's not even debatable that Jordan is the greatest of all time? How can it be that Lebron James, who has more final losses than wins, who is also not the greatest scorer of his era, nor the best playmaker, nor the best defender, nor the best shooter of his era, is regarded by most as a top 3 player of all time?  How can it be? How can it be that most of reddit who hasn't watched most of  Wilt, Russell, Duncan, Hakeem, Kobe, Bird, Magic, Lebron, Jordan will be so confident in their own all time lists, and confident in criticising others for theirs? Why is R/NBA so confident RIGHT AFTER the 2016 3-1 comeback to place Lebron amongst the best of all time? Numbers? If only it were that simple. The NBA would save a lot of money from firing a few more scouts, and hiring a few more mathematicians in devising their algorithms to determine the best player.   You don't have to agree. But the premise that numbers through and through are what most of the general population, and most fans, use to determine whom is greater than whom is imo naive. People will remember less and less of every all time greats numbers as time goes by for them. Stories, that ""something unexplainable"" when you watch something and get an impression from it, is what they will influence their rankings, and influence what they will tell others, and influence whatever ""stats"" they pick to support their argument.   P.S it's probably sugar ray leonard, probably amongst boxers, but that's not what most people would tell you. The widely peddled story around the world will still be Ali. Also you seem to be under the impression I'm a lebron fan. let me be the first to tell you that Curry is my favourite player, but his perception has fallen a lot since 2016....because of? 1 fewer ring? 1 fewer FMVP? or because of how he was perceived to have ""choked"", to be ""destroyed by lebron""?"
"Real talk: when Lebron doesn't play any D, his teammates have no motivation to play any D.  No one will say this but all the statistics point towards Lebron James being one of the very worst defenders in the NBA. He is a worse defender than Enes Kanter. He's a worse defender than a 73 year old Manu.   Either Lebron just can't defend anymore because he's too old or he doesn't make an effort or doesn't understand how to do it. But as long as his defense is literally worse than Kyle Singlers, don't expect guys like JR or D Rose to play any defense either."
"it's easy, they'll tank for four years, gain assets, and then sign LeBron James "
LeBron James retire bitch
"Being a good leader means being a good leader all the time, not just when it's easy. LeBron has problems with conflict resolution, that's why he tweets passive-aggressively and needs ""glue guys"" in the locker room (like James Jones and RJ). When things are going good, they're great; as soon as things turn south, tension builds and the only way LeBron has effectively resolved locker-room conflict is with an intervention-style meeting.  Bron's personality and approach to life has resulted in great success (championships, stable marriage, kids, etc), but has also alienated Kyrie and forced good coaches and FO out of their jobs. Charles Barkley harps on Bron's passive-aggressiveness and Phil Jackson has public called out Bron's ""posse"". There's a reason why all this stuff has happened."

"I doubt it, I think they go down 3-1 either way. The worst thing a coach can do is lose their locker room and Blatt did that. I don't see how he would've been more successful than Lue.  &gt;I’m pretty pissed that Cavs never respected him.  If he wasn't so shook of challenging the stars, maybe things would've gone differently. It's his fault at the end of the day.   Brendan Haywood said this:  &gt;""Coach Blatt was very hesitant to challenge LeBron James,"" Haywood said. ""It was one of those situations where, being a rookie coach, and LeBron being bigger than life, it was a little too much for him. **I remember we had James Jones (talk) to Coach about how, 'Hey, you can't just skip over when LeBron James makes a mistake in the film room.' Because we all see it.**  &gt;**""That's when … as a player, you start to lose respect for a coach.** David Blatt can't come to a huddle and draw up a play that would get us a good shot,"" Haywood said. ""David Blatt doesn't understand sometimes substitution patterns.""  &gt;""The mistake he made against the Bulls when he didn't have the ball in LeBron's hands at the end of the game … There were obvious mistakes he was making, and you start to see it as a player, where 'We're going to have to win this on our own, because he can't do for us what Gregg Popovich can do for the Spurs.'"""

"&gt;“I love Beas,’’ Durant said. “I love his family. I love what he’s doing. He never had a fair chance. I said in a comment earlier this year before the season where he said he was just as skilled as LeBron [James] and myself, and I was feeling him on that.”  &gt;“I was feeling him, because he is,’’ Durant added. “He can score from anywhere. He can score on anybody. He can use both hands, but there’s something else that separates. You know what I’m saying? I think that’s just the difference, the mental part of it. And he’s got the foundation of his game set, it’s just time to build on top of it.”  Pretty fair comments tbh. Obviously Beas was way off comparing himself to Lebron but what is Durant meant to say? ""Oh yeah this guy is whack, me and Bron are 100x the player he is"" "
"Seriously Kevin Love was a monster averaging 26 13 and 26 12 before coming to Cleveland, and now he is an after thought. Lebron James does not help or improve the guys he plays with he uses them to improve himself. He literally sucks talent out of other guys."
I can see Wade saying something. But I'd think he would say something to improve things because he wants LeBron to win. He may not have given a shit in Chicago but I really don't think he would actively hurt a James team. They're too close for that to happen
Part of the problem is LeBron. Everything the team does revolves around him. He's bigger than the organization. There's the positive that you get LeBron James but there's also negatives that come with that. 
LeBron James.  He is hogging all that sweet Kevin Love and he doesnt even know how to use him right.
"What is the most common thing about Lebron James? When his teams are not playing good, the media always blames the big guys. It happened with z, Shaq, Jamison, bosh, mozgov. The simple fact of the matter is that Lebron is so good he’s uncoachable. For some reason coaches will not make him run without the ball on offense. That being said, it’s Lebron James he’s been in the last 7 finals. They will be fine come playoffs trust me "
"Well a team who won a championship isn’t a “joke of a franchise”, in history they aren’t well thought of. A history of bad drafting (and help from the league in my opinion) let them land two number one picks they had no business getting. They aren’t a very tempting destination therefore unless LeBron James is there no star will sign there.   The owner isn’t a problem tho, people like Dolan and Gilbert get bad raps but I would want them as my owner. They’ll pay absolutely anything to win a championship, and if people remember Gilbert gave LeBron everything he wanted prior to Miami. There are certain teams (OKC in 2012) who refused to pay the tax to keep the team together.  "

"What many people don't realize is that Jordan gained, lost, and regained GOAT status.  Most people underestimated Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant during the Bulls' first threepeat, and assumed that Jordan carried the Bulls.  So when he retired in 1993, the Bulls put up a statue and everyone called Jordan the GOAT.  Then a funny thing happened.  In 1992-93 the Bulls won 57 games.  In 1993-94, without Jordan, the Bulls won 55 games!  They did pretty well in the playoffs, sweeping the Cavs, then taking the Knicks to seven games before the Knicks went to the Finals.  Meanwhile, Jordan was having trouble hitting curve balls, and sports articles were starting to make fun of his serious attempt to play professional baseball.  Sports Illustrated put Jordan on the cover with the caption ""Bag it, Michael! Jordan and the White Sox are embarrassing baseball.""  Jordan was no longer on a pedestal.  Then Jordan returned to the NBA in the spring of 1995.  While he showed flashes of brilliance, he also showed considerable rust.  In the playoffs, he was flat out embarrassed by Shaq, Penny, his old teammate Grant, and the rest of the Orlando Magic.  If there had been a vote right then Jordan would no longer have been the consensus GOAT.  Of course we all know what happened next.  Jordan filmed *Space Jam* and invited NBA stars to come play basketball between takes, and pretty much everyone accepted the invitation.  (Charles Barkley later wondered why they all got suckered into helping Jordan work off his rust.)  And then the Bulls had what many considered the greatest season ever.  72 wins in the regular season *and* a championship.  Jordan reestablished his dominance, although he and the league also had a new-found respect for Pippen.  The Bulls went on to a second threepeat and Jordan put a lot of distance between him and any contenders for GOAT -- including future contender LeBron James."

"Suddenly? The Cavs have always been an absolute joke. They're only in this position because of LeBron being one of the best players of all time. The Cavs without LeBron are perennial basement dwellers who got 3 first overall picks in 4 years and a 4th overall. With that they drafted Kyrie (who forced his way out), Dion Waiters (nothing needs to be said), Anthony Bennett (probably the biggest bust of all time) and Andrew Wiggins who never played for them.      They are a clown car franchise and always have been. They owe the large majority of their success to LeBron James."

I can link you plenty of articles and videos about Lebron usurping coaching power, berating coaches, boxing them out of huddles, making his own substitutions...Then all the social media drama, his passive aggressive whining about his own teammates, etc.  Bottom line, Lebron James is so far up his own ass he thinks he’s the best player, coach and GM. That has hurt the Cavs tremendously. And they let him do anything he wants because they are terrified he’s gonna head to greener pastures again with The Decision 2. "

"I wasn’t trying to bait anyone I have no hate towards Kobe or the Lakers but I did say that some Kobe ‘diehards’ would get triggered although these stats aren’t a dent of any sorts in Kobe’s career this was more of the fact of how LeBron James seemingly stepped up while playing stars like Kobe. Kobe’s stats are great in the link above and i don’t understand why you’re getting so worked up when I in no way hinted at Kobe being trash against LeBron or choking. I just stated that LeBron had a 16-6 record against a top 10 player of all time which nothing against Kobe as LeBron too is one of the greats. But disagree all you want, call me a Kobe hater or a LeBron dickrider but all I did was post the comparison of LeBron and Kobe and you wrote the narrative of me being a hater. "
&lt; Stop being overreacting people  &lt; Lists only the last 3-4 years of their achievements   Their history of being a clown organization precedes LeBron James.   *Yes*. This league actually existed before LeBron and thus before you started following the league.

"Wow -- that's pretty bad. Love extended his arm, and Crowder just walked on by. Hey Jae, you represent the jersey and yourself when you step out on the court -- grudges are supposed to be left in the locker room and not played out in front of fans.   I put the blame for this on Tyronn Lue who should not be a head coach and is clearly in-over-his-head this season. The players have tuned him out long ago -- both the ""Old Guard"" and the ""New Guard.""   I would make an NWO/Hollywood Hogan joke, but man, the Cavs look like a lost cause, and I don't feel like being funny after seeing this.   I admire LeBron James and always will, but c'mon, man, you can't have a Clipboard Holder as a coach and think you're going to win a championship anymore. "

Just a friendly reminder that Lebron James takes weeks off to go chill in Miami during the middle of the season.
You clearly are not reading enough. Lebron James himself got called out for being a ball hog and only looking for assist passes. So yeah JR Smith needs to get traded.
"Maybe if he stuck to spot up shooting he'd look OK. Dude is going with all these ridiculous crossover dribbles that do absolutely nothing into a pull up fadeaway. And there's 15 left on the shot clock. LeBron James right next to him, Crowder open with his hands up at the top, IT open next to him."
"James is the 12th in nba careers for assists with near 8k assists. Sure Lebron want to win and be the best, but he doesn't forget the team."
"Lebron is the best teammate one could ever ask for, right? This narrative has been so overblown it doesn't even mean what it's supposed to mean when people say that. Kyrie wanted to leave Lebron, that should give you the cue right there. I remember when the trade or the news broke back then, almost everybody shits on Kyrie for his decision..  There have been multiple times this season that I've seen Lebron blame his teammates for his own defensive shortcoming. While Lebron can also do flashy passes, he gambles a lot on those sometimes, like the behind the back nutmeg to DWade a few days ago, almost led to a turnover before that. People just don't want to admit it. Everyone's supposed to love Lebron James.  Need I remind you that Kevin Love was the one locking up Steph Curry from the perimeter for their final possession if I remember correctly in the 2016 NBA Finals game 7. They nicknamed it ""The D"" or something like that. He doesn't deserves this shit. You can blame Kevin for anything but question his effort on the court. When I watch the nba finals, he's always the one hustling hard out there, yet people talk like he's been trash, it's ridiculous."
"Gonna add years a la Bill Simmons' wine-cellar team.  Also I built this team to win a game so it's not just who are the best/most deserving.  Chose a few alphas but after that I wanted more specialized players (shooting/defense).  Starters:  PG - 2016 Steph Curry  SG - Michael Jordan, whatever year he peaked on defense.  SF - 1986 Larry Bird  PF - 2013 Lebron James  C - 1990 Hakeem Olajuwon  Bench:  PG - 1987 Magic Johnson  PG - 1996 Gary Payton  SG - 2006 Kobe Bryant  SF - 2014 Kevin Durant  PF - 2004 Kevin Garnett  PF - 2006 Dirk Nowitzki  C - 2003 Tim Duncan"
I read the OP but I wanna try do East vs West.

LeBron James and jumping ship when his team isn't a lock at an Eastern Conference title.
"This just goes to show Lebron James is a poor leader and the Cav organization/coaches have no idea what to do. Look at Golden State, they've assembled the star power, but they've really found ways to gel and work as a team without having to constantly trade pieces. Cleveland on the other hand has to trade 2 to 3 key players every year to stay competitive. But yet I was told Lebron James is that talented and dominate. No, he isn't, and he deserves a lot of scrutiny for having to go through so many teammates to win rings."

"I put the number I they’ll get picked at in the bracket [e.g (1)= 1st pick in the draft]—  Team Lebron starters: Kyrie (5), Harden (3), Durant (1), Lebron James (C), Embiid (7)  Team Curry starters: Curry (C), Derozan (8), Giannis (2), Davis (4), Cousins (6)"
"It's an angry Skip Bayless, who is a notorious LeBron hater, rant (or rather, a compilation of thereof) from First Take. Notable memeable exclusions include, but are not limited to, ""my Spurs"", ""Prince James"" and ""Robin to D-Wade's Batman"".  "
i don't think it's lebron's fault  you can't blame everything on lebron james just because he's the best player  do you really think he turned the whole locker room against kevin love? i find that really hard to believe
"Say what you want but he is right. He has proven he can be a leader time and time again for 7 straight years. People are talking about how John Wall (for example) has trouble being John ""John Wall"" Wall consistently on a nightly basis. LeBron meanwhile is playing like LeBron ""27/7/7"" James in every game he plays - making nearly every in-game, in-the-moment, decisions like a coach would. And let's be clear - players will always want to play with him. People have given up tens of millions of dollars to. End of the day most players would pick him in the Top 3 if not 1 to play with. Saying this acknowledging my flair."

"Lebron James on if JR Smith will be fired going forward:  “I would hope not. But, I would hope so.”"
"Well I hate Durant, Pachulia, Green, and the Warriors as a whole. And I loved LeBron James and the Heat. But that doesn't mean I think the Warriors are the better villain of the two.  The Warriors are too good to be enjoyable to hate. And the way they came together isn't conducive to it either, IMO. The Heat went from un-notable to contenders in one off-season; it was like a whole new team popped up, but not one that was guaranteed to win. The Warriors were already great and had a fun rivalry with the Cavs, but then picked up Durant. That ruined the parity we had.  The way the Heat played was also better for the role. More physically and intimidating defense. Those halfcourt traps they ran would completely disorient the other team, it was impressive to watch.  Even their black uniforms helped, I think. They just looked the part better than the Warriors do.  Also, Wade is definitely hateable."
"""The only thing worse than a white guy, is a Mexican guy who looks like a white guy"" - LeBron James 2016"
"I think the reason for the public implosion is the lack of the “everyone shut the fuck up and relax” veterans. Miami had that in James Jones and Udonis Haslem. Cleveland’s had that in James Jones and, IMO, Richard Jefferson.   Now with them gone, LeBron should really be that guy. But he’s pretty damn emotionally fragile, as is D. Wade, and have egos that need to be catered to. Plus a D. Rose who’s pretty emotionally taxed as well. Plus IT who’s out there to prove something to anyone who’s ever doubted him. Plus the sacrificial lamb K. Love. Plus TT, JR, Shump, and the Brooklyn pick.   Yeah idk what solution there is to fix this team lol. They need to play the Suns or the Hawks or something. Blow a bottom feeding team out to feel good again. "
"Eh maybe not, but this is LeBron James he has earned the right to say shit like this "
"Fuck Jae, Fuck Rose, Fuck IT, Fuck Wade, but most importantly, Fuck Lebron and Fish Face as coach. Those two are suppose to run and control this team, Lebron is the leader of this time and controls the locker room. How many of the guys in the locker room are his guys? So I put all the blame on this diva drama horseshit on him. He could be leading by example. Instead he is allowing shit like this to fester and happen.   FUCK LEBRON JAMES."
"as long as lebron james has a pulse, yes"
"I mean just looking at the names on paper, will people really think these two groups of players are not pretty close:  Group A: Lebron, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Giannis  Group B: Michael Jordan, Barkley, Olajuwon, Pippen, Stockton, Malone, Drexler, Shaq, Grant Hill, Payton, David Robinson  The era that MJ dominated was pretty damn stacked even matched up to today's talent. "
Congrats to Bucks legend LeBron James!
"Man, the more I see how petty this team is and how they act like high school sophomore girls, the more I want them to lose so bad and I’m a huge Lebron James fan. KLove doesn’t deserve any of this treatment. The fact that they picked on him for sitting out is ridiculous   Hey JR Swish, why don’t you actually swish it instead of bricking.   TT you just trash and finessed a contract you don’t deserve.   Crowder, you just a bitch   IT, for someone who wants the Boston talk to stop, you bring it up quite a bit.   Ty Lue, grow some balls and put these pima donnas in their place. You’re the coach. Not Lebron.   Lebron, be a damn leader and hold other accountable and also yourself. "
LBJ repeatedly talks about how he would love to be coached under Pop. Pop also has a ton of respect for LeBron. I think it would work out pretty well.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18515342/cavaliers-lebron-james-says-spurs-gregg-popovich-nba-all-greatest-coach  http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2017/01/gregg_popovich_on_lebron_james.html
"He doesnt have to be the worst defensive player in his team, he can be 7th worst defensive player in his team and he would still be one of the worst in the league.  He doesnt need to be top 3 worst for that comment to be true, if hes among 30 worst its true, and hes Lebron James so even if theoretically some deep bench rider in Sacramento is actually worse statistically im gonna rank Lebron ahead of him in awfulness because i feel like it, JFC"
"nah james jones was the only reason lebron was going to the finals, he gone the finals streak gone  srs though i think they might scrape out this year, but next year if lebrons still in cleveland the east is wide open imo."

I feel the most for Lebron “Moon Boy” James :/
"""Still LeBron""? Umm idk if homering here but since when did LeBron take over the MVP lead. James only missed 7 games and LeBron played like shit while Harden was out"
This read like a word problem. I was expecting it to end with:   How many points does LeBron James have? 
"This sub is just like any large sports subreddit. It's extremely reactionary and flows with the season. If the cavs go on a win streak all of this goes away real quick and everyone loves Bron again. Also, factor in that there are people who just love to hate on Lebron so they live for moments like this. They will be the most vocal at any chink in the armor. They will dissipate though like always when the cavs drama ends.    Just ignore it, especially RIGHT after a game ended. People will ignore that JR Smith, Crowder and IT (3/5 of the starting line up) have been really, really bad and place all the blame on Lebron.    This cavs team currently sucks but it's not because of lebron james."
"fine, lebron texted danny ainge asking him when hes going to send over the rest of IT.   i feel like the mental image of Lebron fucking james driving around asking where the rest of this man is much funnier."
"Ive always said Lue doesnt know what in game adjustments are.  He only knows how to make a ""gameplan"". As if blitzing/ fighting off-ball screens harder are new great basketball ideas.  That fucking fish. He's a yes man and doesnt really coach. The fact that there's an obvious lack of heart in the cavs players would warrant the coach to do something about it and there's still nothing is absurd. Fans know about  it, media is enjoying it, other teams are pouncing on it. And there's still no active response.  The team doesnt need help, the team needs their asses to get beat right. Lebron is a big part of the problem and he's also one of the two remaining vets here. Calderon doesnt get as much respect. Losing RJ and James Jones was such a huge blow.  Also Ill say it again, Kevin Love deserves better."
My opinion of LeBron James is unwavering. Fuck him.

LeBron James has more points than everyone in NBA history except for six players. 
"What we mean is there's always an army of lebron apologists watching seemingly watching thread like a Hawk stalking its prey,  and will  swarm every person who criticizes the 4-time MVP. James, who has lost 5 Finals, is like God to them.  "
"And this is what I hate most. We have such a good bench, we have a decent core. Why the hell are we losing so many games? No wonder Kyrie left, dude was sick of having to ball and bail-out the team late in clutch situations.   Trade TT, Shumpert and the Brooklyn pick for Deandre  Trade Isaiah, Cedi and Crowder for Kemba. .  Fire lue, Bring in fizdale.  Cavs Starting 5:  Pg: Kemba / Rose / Calderon / Wade  Sg: Jr / Wade / Hill / Korver  Sf: Lebron / Green / Korver   Pf: Kevin Love / Lebron James / Channing Frye  C: Deandre / Channing / Kevin  Boom competent team with a competent coach. Fuck Crowder outta here. "
Does that mean LeBron is now known as LeBron James-West-Love
"You don’t understand basketball if you think that LeBron is the 4th best player in the league. He’s having a rough patch, I’ll give you that, but he’s still the best player in the league and it’s disrespectful to even dare to say that Harden of all names is better than LeBron fucking James. "

I agree he can be overhyped, but  he's got the 3rd best ORtg on the Cavs behind Calderon and TT and is tied for best DRtg on the team."
LeBron James is still a good basketball player. Come on now.
"are you kidding me? Im not even going to talk about his basketball game because if you're questioning that youre dumb as shit.   Toxic personality? where were you when nba players were gangbanging their gfs and getting sued? or sleeping with minors? give me a break, Lebron james has done nothing except be a great example to young kids. hes a great father and helps out in the community. Go read the story about him staying just to shoot around with kyrie... or what he did for verajao...  fuck it im going to go to basketball because you're dumb as shit. Does he have off games? yea... does he get lackadaisical on defense sometimes? yup.. But he consistently draws the double team, he finds the open man, he hustles for the rebound, he posts/guards EVERY position if needed. The guy averaged a triple double in the playoffs. He lacks a good jumper but he makes up for it with his penetration. Basketball isnt all about scoring, he has incredible vision and sets up his teamates perfectly.   "
"The teams actually break down nicely, but I think the bigs take it easily. Rebounding would be too much of a struggle for the guards, and bigs shooting/ballhandling wouldn't be bad given their diverse talent. Plus the bigs would have a massive defensive advantage.  Guards:  * Kyrie Irving * DeMar DeRozan * Bradley Beal * Kyle Lowry * Victor Oladipo * John Wall * Stephen Curry * James Harden * Russell Westbrook * Damian Lillard * Klay Thompson * Jimmy Butler  Bigs:  * LeBron James * Joel Embiid * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Al Horford * Kevin Love * Kristaps Porzingis * Kevin Durant * DeMarcus Cousins * Anthony Davis * Draymond Green * Karl-Anthony Towns * LaMarcus Aldridge "
"Made time to watch this game since it's CLE vs SAS and LeBron was gonna hit 30k but damn was it depressing to watch. Especially since Mr Fourth Korver and LeBron ""Curry"" James was still a thing last time I watched.  Guess next time I'll make time to watch is when the trades have been completed. Hopefully Lue getting fired."
"Either way I think the undertones of what caused him to leave are what has manifest through the teams struggles now. It's GM/coach LeBron and it results in a lot of issues. JR starting? Why would you even want him on your team? James has been visibly more critical of Love than his other team mates and that disrespect has been echoed by his team. This seems obvious considering no story about James defending Love in that meeting seems to have emerged. That is awful leadership considering the weight his opinion carries.  The issue really is Lebron'a ego. Thats why Love is there to begin with. Its what LBJ preferred over Wiggins. Kyrie seemed to make that obvious, despite being a bit of a hypocrite about it. He's a top 3-5 all time player and still is one of if not the best player's in the league but his +/- says a lot. Lebron is so good that his team always can right the ship and become a contender but the gravity of his role on the team goes both ways, for better or for worse, although it's been for better a lot more."

"I am obsessed with how players feel about each other and how it affects them on-court.  We all have dickheads/best friends that can either help/hurt us in the workplace specifically. Every missed high-five, glare, or passive aggressive media jab couldn’t be more relatable to me. I hate some people at my job, and apparently, so does LeBron James. Those storylines make January-March more bearable."
"[here you go](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2724430-kyrie-irving-reportedly-didnt-want-to-be-son-to-lebron-james-with-cavaliers)  Specifically, per The Undefeated's Stephen A. Smith, Irving doesn't appreciate James treating him like a child.   ""Kyrie isn't saying he's better than LeBron and should be seen that way,"" a close confidant of Irving's told Smith. ""He's saying he's not about to let LeBron 'SON' him … treating him like he's the child and LeBron's the father or big brother he's supposed to look up to.""  When ESPN's Brian Windhorst first reported Irving wanted the Cavaliers to trade him on July 21, it was because he ""wants to play in a situation where he can be more of a focal point and that he no longer wants to play alongside [James]."""
You have LeBron James 
Probably jealous of his SI swimsuit model gf.  I mean didn't Lebron just get shot down by an instagram model a couple months ago?

"George would be better than any teammate LeBron has this season, and vice versa obviously, and the Lakers could open enough cap room to max both of those guys and still have 20 million in room to add more pieces. George and James is also a much more logical foundation for beating the Warriors than the weirdly unbalanced rosters of OKC and Cleveland. "
"Lebron James is, statistically, the worst 33 year old to achieve 30,000 total points in the NBA"
"So you’re telling me that Lebron James has never scored 27+ points, had 7+ rebounds, and 7+ assists in a game???"
"Can't wait for the Instagram post Lebron makes tomorrow!   *Picture of Lebron James getting drafted*  ***""Insert corny caption about being the NBA all time leading scorer.""***"
"&gt;Steph’s team is more fun than Lebron’s team   &gt;&gt;&gt;   Only if you think shooting is the only fun nothing in basketball, then sure   But all the best and most dominant players are in Bron's team, along with all the best BIGS.   &gt;&gt;&gt;  Only Big dudes Curry's team got are Giannis and Embiid, that's it. Unless the shooters in his team doesn't miss any shot, they will get vaporized by Bron's team..    &gt;&gt;&gt;   TBH, obviously few people loves watching the lil guys dribble dribble dribble and shoot, that's fun for them. For someone like me, i like watching the best and most dominant players, dominate. Straight up. That's the most fun thing in basketball.    &gt;&gt;&gt;   Watching  LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis all in one fucking team would be orgasmic"
"No, I completely understand how the CBA works.  The problem is that nobody was even considering giving Thompson, JR, or Shumpert those 4 year deals collectively costing $46m a year.  Fearing that Lebron James was going to leave again, he forced their hand.  Did you already forget that [JR Smith tried to leave](http://www.slamonline.com/nba/j-r-smith-on-regretting-opting-out-of-contract-yes-and-no/), despite [James pressuring Cavs to sign him big](http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2016/09/lebron_james_warns_cavs_to_sig.html), and [nobody wanted him](https://cavsnation.com/carmelo-anthony-doesnt-understand-j-r-smith-still-unsigned/).  They suck and nobody else wants to take on those albatros contracts.  They are stuck with them unless they are willing to part with the Brooklyn Nets pick, which BTW is becoming less appealing as the Nets climb out of the cellar.    Don't let the fact you are a homer blind you from the epic clusterfuck that is swirling around the Gund Arena. "
"That's not true that no one cares anymore. Yes, everyone agrees he's really damn good, there's no question. He's fucking amazing, super skilled. But to be compared to Lebron James' legendary career and achievements, that went out the window when he joined a 73-9 team that can won it without him. He's still going to continue to have an amazing career and could potentially even challenge LBJ and Kareem for the all-time scoring title, but unless he leaves GSW, and wins a ring that way, I just don't see how he can surpass LBJ."
I would like to request crowns (King James) and chef hats (Chef Curry) as the logos. Or maybe splashes for Curry. I just want cooler names than Team Lebron and Team Steph.
Like skip said no one is guarding anyone. For every dunk someone has Steph and James can knock down an open 3. It would be great if Kyrie went through with his knee surgery now to not play with Lebron 
"I remember being pissed off about the tone of https://www.theplayerstribune.com/how-i-spent-my-summer-vacation/ (maybe it was a different thing he wrote I'm thinking of?) but now I reread it and don't know what I was upset about. My main takeaway is that Kevin Love, with all his strengths, was at that point not a great leader and we were expecting him to be one because he was great on the court. I might have been annoyed that Love was complaining about the Wolves team culture instead of leading them to it like LeBron did on the plane. LeBron James is great at all aspects of basketball."

Round 7 LeBron: Kristaps Porzingis Curry: Kyle Lowry  Round 8 Curry: Karl Anthony-Towns LeBron: LaMarcus Aldridge  Round 9 LeBron: Bradley Beal Curry: Jimmy Butler  Round 10 Curry: Al Horford LeBron: Victor Oladipo  Round 11 LeBron: John Wall Curry: Damian Lillard

Like I am embarrassed for you. I have played basketball for 1 year when I was in 5th grade. I scored a single point the entire year. It is clear to say that I was terrible. But, according to you, the only thing holding me back from playing basketball in the national basketball league, is me not appreciating dame being a 3 time all star.

"At this point anyone not named LeBron James needs to be on the table. I would make a goal to flip half the team and move whatever draft picks I needed to. They have half a season left with the best player ever. This team is mediocre with him. They need to start from stretch. If that means being a bottom feeder for 5+ years afterwards, so be it. "
Lebron ‘Danny Hinkie’ James
"All teams have luck. Few if any were as dependent on it as the Heat were. Some huge differences:  1) Duncan didn't lead to Tony Parker and Manu and Kawhi in the way that Wade led to Lebron and Bosh. Sure, you could argue Duncan's presence helped them develop those guys, but that's not the same as the obvious direct connection between Wade's presence in Miami and Lebron and Bosh choosing to play there.  2) By the same token, signing Lebron and Bosh is not nearly as insightful and commendable choice as drafting and developing the players the Spurs drafted and developed. The front office in San Antonio discovered and developed those players. Riley did not discover Bosh and James.  3) The Spurs have been consistently dominant even after Duncan declined. Even with Wade, the Heat weren't that good. The Shaq/Wade title season that team was a good but not great team... similar to maybe the Timberwolves this year. They just so happened to be in an awful conference and got hot at the exact right time and then had a perfect matchup in the finals against a Mavs team that's biggest weakness was against dribble penetration. Then the refs gave Wade more free throws than I think anyone had ever gotten in the finals before (and Wade played incredibly) and Shaq had a vintage playoff run... Just so many things came together for that team. If you re-ran 2005/2006 100 times, my guess is the Heat would win the title maybe twice.  So what is the last 15 years of Heat basketball if say Mourning is healthy the first 6 weeks of the 02/03 season and the Heat end up drafting Chris Kaman instead of Dwyane Wade?  Hard to judge definitively, but the major moves that Riley actually has made haven't been particularly ingenious in that span. The only major trade that wasn't a no-brainer was the Shaq trade, and that was a move that was more than likely to have backfired in the same way most trades where you send out a bunch of young guys for declining star when you're barely a .500 team do. Like, you could compare the Heat trade for Shaq to the Nets' trade for KG and Pierce... That's the worst case scenario with trades like that. The Heat had a luckbox perfect case outcome.  Then in the big three era, it seems almost without question that Riley knew ahead of time that Lebron and Bosh wanted to come to Miami, so he did the only thing to do and cleared cap room and then signed a bunch of decent title hunting vets with the remaining resources he had... Nothing revolutionary there. If he didn't have a great amount of intelligence saying those two would come, then that's another huge example of crazy luck. Where would the heat be if Bosh and James didn't come?"

Because Lebron James brought scrubs + Ilgauskas to the finals multiple times. 
"LeBron coming to Cleveland was the best thing that ever happened to Irving's career. Without that, Kyrie would still be on a treadmill team with no hopes of playoff success, having to wait out his 5-year contract (which he signed before LeBron returned).  Based on all the stories about Irving, it seems like the explanation is simply that he's a player who cares more about his individual accolades and accomplishments than team success, e.g.:  &gt;During a rare practice in the middle of last season, coach Tyronn Lue, who was standing next to assistant coach and Irving confidante Phil Handy, called out to his young point guard. “Ky,” Lue said, “I want you to play a little faster.” “Why?” Irving asked. “Because if we play faster, we get shots off easier.” “I don’t need to play faster to get my shot off,” Irving replied. “I can do that anytime.” “I’m not talking about your shot. I’m talking about RJ and JR,” Lue said, citing teammates Richard Jefferson and Smith. ""Well, that’s No. 23’s job,” Irving replied, referring to James. According to members of the Cavs organization who witnessed the exchange, Lue ended the conversation by walking away, shaking his head.  Being unwilling to adapt his game to maximize his team's success, because it reduces his individual stats. Being on a team with someone who overshadows him prevents him from being in the spotlight, so he wanted out. Can't say I respect that mindset."
Yea. Because Lebron James is a proven champion.   This isn't that complicated.

"Here's how the NBA would look  **West (Based on Current Standings)**  Golden State: Lose Steph Curry   Houston: Lose James Harden   San Antonio: Lose Kawhi Leonard  Minnesota: Lose Jimmy Butler  Oklahoma City: Lose Russell Westbrook  New Orleans: Lose Anthony Davis  Portland: Lose Damian Lillard  Denver: Lose Nikola Jokic  LA Clippers: Lose Blake Griffin  Utah: Lose Rudy Gobert (Donovan Mitchell could be soon...)  LA Lakers: Lose Brandon Ingram (tough call...between him, Lonzo, and Kuzma)  Memphis: Lose Marc Gasol (tough call between him and Mike Conley)  Phoenix: Lose Devin Booker  Dallas: Lose Harrison Barnes  Sacramento: Lose Willie Cauley-Stein (tough call, lotta guys getting 20-30 minutes)  **East (Based on current standings)**  Boston: Lose Kyrie Irving (Horford has a case too, honorable mention Hayward)  Toronto: Lose DeMar DeRozan (Lowry honorable mention)  Cleveland: Lose LeBron James  Miami: Lose Hassan Whiteside  Washington: Lose John Wall  Indiana: Lose Victor Oladipo  Philadelphia: Lose Joel Embiid (Honorable Mention: Ben Simmons)  Milwaukee: Lose Giannis Antetokounmpo  Detroit: Lose Andre Drummond  New York: Lose Kristaps Porzingis  Charlotte: Lose Kemba Walker  Chicago: Lose Zach LaVine (tough call between him, Markkanen, and Mirotic)  Brooklyn: Lose D'Angelo Russell  Atlanta: Lose Dennis Schroder   Orlando: Lose Nikola Vucevic (honorable mention: Aaron Gordon)  _____________________________________  Assuming literally everyone else on the team is healthy except the one star (examples: Jabari Parker on the Bucks becomes available to play, Dante Exum on the Jazz, etc.) here's what I think the standings would be.  **WEST**  1. Golden State: Still have KD, Draymond, Klay...plus strong bench  2. San Antonio: Literally the #3 seed right now without Kawhi  3. Houston: CP3 is good enough to keep them decent  4. Oklahoma City: Westbrook is valuable, but PG13 and Melo would provide enough offensive firepower to keep them decent. They've both proven they are capable of leading teams to the playoffs as the primary option(s).  5. Denver: Jokic is valuable but they also get Millsap back in this scenario. Very deep squad  6. LA Clippers: Played quite a bit of this season without Blake Griffin. Beverley, Gallo, and Rivers are healthy in this scenario. Lou Will is nice.  7. Portland: Still have CJ McCollum to score the ball a lot, and Shabazz Napier isn't the worst replacement for Lillard. Pretty deep team  8. Minnesota: Watch the T-Wolves quite a bit, Jimmy Buckets is the reason this team wins. Wiggins and KAT put up stats but Jimmy is the engine that grinds out wins with his 2-way play. Bench is questionable, Thibs rotations would kill Wiggins and KAT in the long run too.  9. Utah: Played without Gobert quite a bit this year, Donovan Mitchell is the truth  10. New Orleans: They are the Kings from a couple years ago without AD. Solomon Hill comes back in this scenario, but AD is a tough piece to lose, they don't have a ton of depth.  11. LA Lakers: Don't have a true star player which helps in this scenario. Lotta solid role players  12. Memphis: They lose Gasol but get Mike Conley back which makes it a near wash  13. Dallas: Bottom of the standings are pretty much the same, they have a bunch of decent backcourt players to give them occasional wins+Dirk.  14. Sacramento: Pretty deep team with no true star. Pretty young tho  15. Phoenix: Devin Booker is a stud, they are bad with him, but without him they might be the worst team in the West  **EAST**  1. Boston: Lose Kyrie get Hayward back. Brad Stevens is a top 3 coach  2. Toronto: Losing DeRozan hurts, but Lowry is a capable scorer and the team is pretty solid this year  3. Miami: Erik Spolestra can make a good team with anybody, they have a lot of solid pieces as well  4. Washington: Losing Wall would hurt a lot, hopefully Porter and Beal step up  5. Indiana: Myles Turner would need to step up in scoring the ball without Oladipo  6. Philadelphia: Joel Embiid already sits out quite a few games. Ben Simmons can carry them to a low seed in this scenario, plus Fultz gets back in this scenario...don't know how good he is after his frozen shoulder issue.  7. Cleveland: Terrible defensively, but maybe they get prime Kevin Love back  8. Chicago: They've been pretty decent since Mirotic got back, and they've played well without LaVine this year. Very solid pieces  9. Milwaukee: Giannis is a top 10 player in this league and losing him hurts, but remember they also get back 20 PPG scorer Jabari Parker in this scenario  10. Detroit: Tobias Harris is capable of keeping this team from the bottom of the standings without Drummond  11. New York Knicks: Beasley goes OFF and shows the world he's a top 2 pick for a reason  12. Brooklyn: Already played most of the year without D-Lo  13. Charlotte: Dwight Howard gets all the post touches he wants finally in this scenario  14. Orlando: Vucevic has missed a lot of the year already. Jonathan Isaac becomes healthy in this scenario among others  15. Atlanta Hawks: Losing Schroder would suck         "

'James' and 'Lebron' 
You realise the whole point of Kyrie leaving the Cavaliers was to prove he can lead a team by himself? .. without the help of a certain Lebron James. 
"&gt;I know Windhorst gets a shit ton of hate around here, and some still think he's Lebron's mouthpiece, but in the past few years he didn't shy away from criticizing Lebron or the Cavs and has produced quality journalism.  In the article that he co-authored when the Kyrie trade demand became public, he literally said that one of the reasons Kyrie was upset was because he was mad at James for being too generous.    Has anyone heard of that before?  A guy make 3 straight finals with a team and gets a ring and then wants traded because his teammate is too generous?  Not only does that make Kyrie look like a complete unreasonable douche, it makes no sense on its face.  Do we get any details or stories or examples to support this bullshit sounding claim?    Of course not.  The idea that people look at shit like this and walk away thinking Windy is a quality journalist blows my mind.  Like how does any respectable journalist put something so bullshit sounding in an article when they *know* it makes one guy look like a total shit and then doesn't provide *any* back-up at all to it?  How does a serious journalist just throw out such crazy allegations without presenting *anything* to support them or answer basic questions a reader would have?"
"Nah I disagree. The show is pretty good and its more then just Shannon's funny lines. I like when Shannon brings up his past experiences as a pro athlete and how he relates it today's game. Can't get that shit with First Take.  I also like Broussard take on things. And believe it or not Rob Parker is pretty funny as too with his jokes.  The only time the show gets ass is when they talk about the same shit like every other show. You know the cowboys, Lavar/Lonzo Ball, and Lebron James."
Haha this is LeBron James. You don’t think teams will dump picks to shed salary? Ryno and Gordon will probably be gone but we can make space if he picks the Rockets
i think 'way better than Pierce' is a pretty elite level...  I would describe lebron james as way better than Pierce.    I'm..not sure I would describe any other active players that way. maybe steph or KD but tbh I would probably describe them as better than Pierce and not 'way' better.  THIS IS PRECISE TERMINOLOGY 
" &gt;When word first leak of Irving's trade request in July, James, who was vacationing with family, was initially upset -- incensed, even -- that Irving asked out and cited James as a reason.  LeBron seems like he wanted Kyrie to stay. I don't think LeBron is the type of dude who wants to trade his best teammate. He left Miami because Wade was declining, and saw Kyrie on the rise. Kyrie was only getting closer to peaking. LeBron, for all his faults, wants to be surrounded by talent, and Kyrie was talent on the rise. No way he wanted him out.   &gt;But, according to multiple sources, James ultimately asked the Cavs' front office not to trade Irving after the request was made known, promising to bridge the apparent gap with him. And James was told the Cavs believed they had no choice but to trade Irving.  &gt;""I went straight to the guy,"" James said in September, describing his interaction with Irving before he was traded. James has refused repeated requests from cleveland.com to disclose why the Cavs said Irving had to be traded.  &gt;""(Irving) basically just let me know that that was the direction that he wanted to go in,"" James said. ""And I was OK with that. And it's a business. I understand that. It doesn't stop me from leading this franchise and leading this team and going on about it.""  All this seems to indicate LeBron wanted Kyrie around, but ultimately couldn't convince Kyrie to stay. "
"Wow... I really want to know what happened with Kyrie and LeBron. It might not have been either directly with each other, as I remember seeing how Lue (or some coach) basically didn't value the way Kyrie wanted to play.   &amp;nbsp;  Something alone the lines of Kyrie saying but that's not how I win games, and coach/Lue said, that's why we have LeBron.  &amp;nbsp;  hopefully I remember that right.  &amp;nbsp;  Edit: I ended up not remembering it right, here's the article from earlier this month that talks about Kyrie and Lue having that exchange   https://www.sbnation.com/2018/1/3/16844970/kyrie-irving-trade-cavaliers-lebron-james-communication"
"Might get downvoted, but I'm shooting my shot: Lebron James.  He continuously undermines his coach and demands his front office hand out massive contract extensions to role players (JR &amp; TT). How is a team supposed to work together when the players aren't even sure who is in charge?"

I don’t think Lebron cared to keep him or not. But there were always rumors around the times of their re-signings that Lebron wanted to keep JR and TT, who each were demanding higher contracts than they deserve now (and at the time TT was compared statistically to Ed Davis who makes ~$6M). To be fair for every article saying Lebron was making some demands there was another saying it wasn’t true, though that’s often the case for a lot of rumors.    Edit: Kevin O’Connor also said he got JR and TT pod on the Ringer Group Chat podcast today. "

"&gt;The NBA will not televise the NBA All-Star draft. Initially, that decision makes you wonder why even have it at all. The whole point is the drama of picking and choosing, the politics and the pettiness. That’s the riveting part, not the East and West being mixed.  &gt;But the more I think about it, the more I come to see why the NBA is passing on the playground-style draft. Because it could go like this:  &gt;Commissioner Adam Silver: LeBron James, you have the first pick. Stephen Curry, you pick second.  &gt;LeBron: Gimmie KD.  &gt;Kevin Durant: That’s right. No. 1!  &gt;LeBron: You were supposed to go to the Warrriors and squash the Under Armour empire by now. But somehow, the Curry 4s are selling and not on sale at Ross.  &gt;Durant: But …  &gt;LeBron: You had one job.  &gt;Durant: You don’t understand the spell he has on 13-year-olds, man.  &gt;LeBron: That’s why I’m picking you first. I’m bequeathing you the throne so you can take over middle schools...   That's what a copy/paste into notepad gets you after highlighting everything. It seems pretty stupid"

"If this is the framework through which we're making the argument, I think sixers would make the more attractive destination for Lebron anyway.   Embiid/Simmons as a duo are better than Ball/Kuzma/Ingram as a trio plus we have Saric/Roco/TJ all locked up for cheap. Jury is out but we also have the best prospect from this year's draft waiting in the shadows to return in Fultz.   Simmons/JJ Redick or replacement/Covington/Lebron James/Joel Embiid as a starting lineup is legit.   Off the bench: TJ McConnell, Markelle Fultz, and Dario Saric + whoever else  "
"I feel like IT does have a little bit of ego problem. Jae Crowder and IT think that after 2 good seasons in Boston (where, lets be honest Brad Stevens was making them punch way above their weight), they deserve to be on the same level as LeBron James."
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, DeMarcus Cousins, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Love, Bradley Beal, Kyle Lowry, and LaMarcus Aldridge.   vs   Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Kristaps Porzingis, Damian Lillard, Karl-Anthony Towns, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, and Al Horford   I want to see James Harden recruiting LeBron for next year. KD and Westbrook throwing lobs again. Kyrie and LeBron running PNR. Klay Thompson and Steph going back and forth jacking up threes against each other. Anthony Davis and Greek in PNR."
"my dunmass idea to make the Cavs a championship team  trade 1: Lebron James for Draymond Green and Klay Thmopson   trade 2: CJ Mcollum for Kevin Love  Trade 3: IT, Frye, Shump Nets pick for Marc Gasol   Warriors get Lebron Curry and Durant as the big 3  Cavs get CJ Klay Green and Gasol  Portland gets Love  Grizzlies get that Brooklyn pick and tank  YOLO "
"I think it is less about LeBron ""little bro'ing"" him and more about the idea that LeBron wanted to fuck the future to go into win now mode with no commitment to be there long term.    Sure, LeBron is free to do that, but how does that approach/attitude impact Kyrie.  I mean, if you are Kyrie and you look at James and you see a guy that:  * is maximizing the team's roster/asset for the timeline/window that best suits him * is maximizing assets that fit his play style * is the clear leader of the team * has massive front office pull * has huge roots and ties to the city beyond his NBA career  etc., but *still* won't commit to the team past this year, what message you think that sends Kyrie?  Why would he have any interest in sticking around when he *doesn't* have most or all of those same things.  Now, LeBron is free to do all that shit, but that doesn't mean that LeBron's attitude/decision to do things to fuck the Cavs long term to max his chances this year isn't going to drive people away from wanting to spend the next 1, 2, 5, or 10 years of their career there.  Blaming the F.O. or blaming players like Kyrie for that comes off as dumb and out of touch."
"Pasting the article here since it's behind paywall. My bad, guys.    The NBA will not televise the NBA All-Star draft. Initially, that decision makes you wonder why even have it at all. The whole point is the drama of picking and choosing, the politics and the pettiness. That’s the riveting part, not the East and West being mixed.  But the more I think about it, the more I come to see why the NBA is passing on the playground-style draft. Because it could go like this:  Commissioner Adam Silver: LeBron James, you have the first pick. Stephen Curry, you pick second.  LeBron: Gimmie KD.  Kevin Durant: That’s right. No. 1!  LeBron: You were supposed to go to the Warrriors and squash the Under Armour empire by now. But somehow, the Curry 4s are selling and not on sale at Ross.  Durant: But …  LeBron: You had one job.  Durant: You don’t understand the spell he has on 13-year-olds, man.  LeBron: That’s why I’m picking you first. I’m bequeathing you the throne so you can take over middle schools across the land.  KD: Bequeathing? I took that, homie.  Curry: Maaaaaan. Fu … dge Nike. Give me Klay Thompson.  LeBron: See, I knew that was coming. I’m a student of the game.  Curry: Klay … Klay! What are you doing???  Klay: I can’t find my lighter.  Curry: Man, come over here. I picked you.  Silver: Klay Thompson is not eligible for the first round. You must choose from the pool of starters that were voted in.  Draymond Green: (*through gritted teeth*) Steph! That’s not the plan!  Green nods his head twice to the right.  Curry: Oh yeah! My bad. You know me. I lose focus sometimes.  Ron Adams: Yeah, we know!  Curry: Give me Anthony Davis.  Davis: Niiiiice!  Kyrie Irving: Hol’ up … hol’ up … I see what’s happening here.  LeBron: Y’all doing this again???  Curry: What? I’m picking players just like you. Why is it a problem when I select a player???  LeBron: Nah. It’s cool, Steph. It’s cool. I’m ready this time.  Whadduya say Ky! Down for one more run together?  Kyrie: Respectful requests usually come with a please.  LeBron: I’m the King!! I don’t say please to nobody. What I look like?!?!  Draymond: Don’t let him talk to you like that Ky!  Kyrie: See, this is why I left.  LeBron: I don’t care! I’m taking James Harden!  KD: (*whispers in Bron’s ear*) You ain’t supposed to pick him. He with adidas.  Bron: WE RUN NIKE! And Kyrie acting funny again! I’m through with him!  Kyrie: Control is but an illusion. The truly free are those who surrender to the reality of having no control.  Curry: I’ll take Kyrie. My bad, James. You were my next pick.  LeBron: We need some size. Lemme see. … Give me Joel Embiid.  Embiid: Finally. You guys were taking too long to trust the process. I should have been the first pick.  LeBron: Don’t trip, bro. I’ll make sure Rihanna holla at you as a bonus.  Embiid: I told everybody I’m off her now. She didn’t want me then, I don’t want her.  Harden: You say that now. You know you wanna see her nakey nakey naked.  Curry: Yes! Give me Giannis!  Draymond: Told you we’d get him too! This chess. This ain’t checkers!  Cousins: You betta pick me, Bron! I ain’t no last pick!  Davis: You not last. You see all these cats out here?  Cousins: Last of the first round! I ain’t last at nothing. Bron, don’t play me out here like this.  LeBron: Cuz, I already got Joel. I can’t have two centers.  Cousins: I ain’t just a center fool! Stop tryna play me! I play the four and I can run the point. My 3 is better than yours!  Durant: Pick Cuz, man. You know he gone blow a gasket if you don’t. Let him live.  LeBron: C’mon Cuz. You know I got you.  Cousins: That’s what I thought!  Thompson: Here it is! Found my lighter!  Curry: Let’s go DeMar DeRozan. You know I love The Six.  DeRozan: Right on. Right on. Let’s have some fun.  Drake: Somebody said The Six?  Durant: Don’t nobody give a damn about no Drake night!  Silver: This is a closed meeting, Aubrey.  Drake: I’m with DeMar. He said I can get one of his stints.  Silver: That’s not allowed under the CBA.  Drake: But I’m designing the uniforms.  Russell Westbrook: No you ain’t! I already set up a designer from Milan to make 'em!  Drake: But I’m making a soundtrack.  Damian Lillard: Too late. I’m already on it.  Drake: Can I at least perform at halftime?  Victor Oladipo: I could use another background singer. You a tenor, right?  Silver: So the starting lineups go as follows:  Team LeBron James consists of himself, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid and DeMarcus Cousins.  Team Stephen Curry consists of himself, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Giannis Antetokounmpo and DeMar DeRozan.  Now for the reserves. LeBron, since you had the first pick in the first round, Steph you get the first pick of the second round.  Curry: My brother of Splash. Klay Thompson.  Thompson: So, I’m set right? That’s all you need from me?  Draymond: Klay, where is you going bro???  Thompson: Um … I’m just … about to make sure Rocco is still safe outside.  Cousins: I’m coming witchu.  Silver: To check on Rocco?  Cousins: Um … yeah. It’s like he both our dog. We just keep him at Klay house.  Silver: You two are not checking on Rocco without me. Stay here. LeBron, your pick.  LeBron: Let’s go Russ!  Westbrook: Hell nah! I ain’t playing with him!  LeBron: Oh, so you gone play for Steph???  Westbrook: I don’t play for nobody! I play for myself! Because why not!  KD: Brodie calm down with all that. Just play basketball, man. Cut the act.  Curry: I ain’t picking him. I wanna win.  Westbrook: What you say!?! I’ll play you 1-on-1 right now!  LeBron: Chill y’all! Damn! Russ. Let’s go Brodie. We hooping.  Silver: Curry, your next pick, please.  Thompson: Sucks. It’s a beautiful, sunny day outside and I’m stuck in here.  Curry: Draymond.  LeBron: I’ll take Jimmy Butler.  Curry: Karl-Anthony Towns.  LeBron: Kristaps Porzingis.  Curry: Victor Oladipo.  Draymond: Oh, we about to destroy y’all!  KD: Bet a rack.  Draymond: Bet 5 racks.  KD: Done. Easy money.  LeBron: D-Wade. Where D-Wade at?  Silver: You are only allowed to select from the current crop of All-Stars.  LeBron: What?! I’m the King! I can pick my brother if I want!  Chris Paul: Well actually, Bron, as the president of the players association, I can confirm that the agreement was only current All-Stars.  LeBron: Why would you even agree to that? You know I gotta have my guys with me.  CP: That’s not true. I believe in you bro. You can do anything.  Curry: It’s you can do ALL things. If you gone steal my slogan, at least get it right.  Kyrie: But didn’t you steal it from the Bible, though?  Curry: It’s not stealing if it’s from the Bible.  Silver: LeBron, please make your next selection.  LeBron: John Wall.  Curry: This one for The Town. Give me Dame.  LeBron: Giiiiiive meeeee … LA.  Kyrie: See! I knew you was going to the Lakers!  Paul George: Let’s goooooooooooo!  LeBron: Chill out! I meant give me LaMarcus Aldridge! Geez.  Curry: Bradley Beal.  LeBron: I see what you’re doing. Trying to load up on shooters?  Curry: (*whispers*) And a little light recruiting.  LeBron: Kyle Lowry.  Curry: OK, last pick. Hmmmm. This is tough.  I’ma close my eyes and throw my mouthpiece. Whoever I hit is my pick.  Embiid: But I thought you only threw it at refs and fans.  Draymond: You’re not allowed to talk until you make the playoffs.  Curry: It was a joke. Relax. Give me Kev … no, give me Al Horford.  Kevin Love: Dammit, Steph! C’mon bro! I promise I won’t lock you up on the perimeter ever again.  Wall to Beal: Look at Kyrie over there cracking up.  Beal: Hilarious.  Wall: I bet he’s so glad he’s out of that mess.  Beal: Must feel good. Tops in the East. Free from his ball-dominant co-star who tries to control everything. He’s living the life.  Wall: Riiiight … wait, what you trying to say???  LeBron: Give me CP. I ain’t taking K-Love.  Silver: Again, you can only pick current All-Stars.  LeBron: HE’S THE GREATEST POINT GUARD EVER. How is he not an All-Star this year???  CP: It’s cool. Me, Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green got somewhere to go anyway.  Blake Griffin: You sure you don’t want a go-to guy like Lou Williams?  Curry: Let him have CP. He is All-Star worthy.  Silver: The coaches did not vote him in. I can’t allow it.  LeBron: Not surprised. I never get any calls in this league anymore.  Curry: All right, I’ll take Kevin Love as my final pick.  LeBron: You can have him. Al Horford, let’s go.  Horford: Great. I’m on the top seed in the East and the last pick? Do I get a prize or something?  Harden: You get to win. Look at our squad.  Thompson: We about to light it up. We’ve got the best shooters on the globe.  Kyrie: Well, actually, it’s not a …  Butler: Let it go, Ky. Just let it go.  "

Demanding overpayments to his buddies. Those guys aren't even tradable anymore. "
We lost RJ AND James Jones... our veteran leaders are now LeBron and Kevin Love so you can see how this is working out for us.....
"Even with Kyrie and our defense, it is hard to imagine going shot for shot with Lebron James + Kevin Love + IT for a seven game series. We're relying heavily on jay tates and jaylen and the kids just aren't there yet."
It took seven years for Danny Ainge to figure out how to defeat Lebron James.  The answer was sabotage
You guys are gonna laugh but I got my first chase down block after I turned the ball over in intramural basketball yesterday and I literally felt like Lebron James.  One of the most satisfying plays you can make in basketball imo.  Sorry just had to get that off my chest lmao
"""And with the first pick in the 2018 All Star Draft, Lebron James selects.... Dwyane Wade"""
fuck Lebron James
"I don’t agree. His game isn’t predicated on athleticism and he’s still an above average defender when he wants to be.   The problem is he’s not cut out to be the first option. People outside of Memphis don’t realize it, but Mike Conley really draws attention away from him, as did his high low game with Z-Bo. On top of that, he has an obsession with making the right play and he isn’t as selfish as he should be sometimes. He isn’t a first option mentally.   Look at his surrounding talent. They don’t know how to play with him. I guarantee if he played with someone like LeBron James he’d kill it. He’d spot up, move the ball, play high low, pick and pop.... enough said.   That being said, I’m not trying to sell Gasol to Cleveland. Unless they offer the Brooklyn pick (they won’t) I wouldn’t trade him. He’s a Memphis legend and aside from a huge offer I would like him to be a Grizzly for life. His contract rn isn’t even that bad bc he signed the max before the cap spike. It’s the Parsons signing that screwed us. "
"I love it when redditors try to be revisionist historians here. OKC would have lost in the finals against the Cavs. They did not match up well against the cavaliers. They beat OKC pretty handily both times that season with Kyrie only playing 9 total minutes in those matchups.    They had no way of stopping Love and Lebron James, OKC was that one team Kevin Love matched up really well with, Ibaka had trouble guarding him. And Kyrie would have also went off on them in the finals against them.    Hell you even had Cavs players come out and say that they were hoping to face OKC in the finals instead of the warriors. Lebron has always had Durant’s number throughout his career until KD decided to run off to a 73 win team.    Bottom line is Westbrook couldn’t get it done with having a top 20 all time player by his side. He made the finals that one year due to Durant and Harden going off in the WCF. You won’t win a championship with Westbrook as your best player. If that wasn’t the case then KD wouldn’t have left. Deep down inside KD knew that he wouldn’t get it done against Lebron in OKC.   "
"yeah KAT will definitely be up there when all is said and done. LeBron could potentially get to 500mil first, followed by James Harden. Not sure if Russ will be able to get another max after his current; otherwise I'd put him up there too. Possibly KD but again he's already 29 and taking a paycut.  You're right it will be completely re-written, but if anyone has a chance to stay up there it would be LeBron. Health is a huge factor and he was an absolute ironman. "
"Why don't you equate it to the likelihood of LeBron James scoring 10,000 points in a single game like you did in the post?"
"As long as there is breath in Lebron James, the Cavs will be in the finals.    And no hes not going to philly."
If we have Kyrie and smart back I don’t see how you guys beat us in 7   Also yes you are crazy to think you can make the finals. I’ve said it once I’ll say it again   Lebron James is the majority shareholder of the Eastern Conference LLC
playing better or not there's this guy named LeBron James. He still runs the east
Bodies by LeBron James
"""Hmmm should I mention that 19-1 run they just went on or handing Houston their only L during their massive streak?  Nah, let's talk about them losing three road games to the two other best teams in the East and say things like 'LeBron James is really good' that no one can argue with."""

"Not really in order other than maybe the top 3:  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Stephen Curry  Dwight Howard  Kobe Bryant  Dirk Nowitzki  Tim Duncan  Chris Paul  Dwyayne Wade  Melo? Kevin Love? I don't know who to put in the last spot tbh. Melo definitely was one of the best players in the league around the turn of the decade, but he doesn't have anything to show for it and he's hot garbage now. Kevin Love is pretty underrated imo. In Minnesota he was one of the better players in the league. Both of these players suffer from bad defense though.  Maybe Boogie or Anthony Davis or Kyrie or Westbrook or Harden or Kawhi. There's a lot of borderline guys that will definitely be on all 2010's team by the end of the decade.  Edit: LaMarcus Aldridge is also a great shout. I'd put him with Melo and KLove in contention for the last spot."
"For those who are out of the loop:  Here's a [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/88zm8t/lebron_has_copyright_issues_with_crimson_tide/) to the original /r/NBA thread about the issue. [The article](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22999408/lebron-james-muldia-platform-uninterrupted-issues-letter-alabama-addressing-concerns-copyright-infringement) the thread refers too states:   &gt;Last week, the official Twitter account for Alabama football released a trailer for ""Shop Talk,"" with Alabama alumnus Julio Jones joining Saban and other football players for an off-the-cuff roundtable discussion in a barbershop setting.  &gt;On Monday, ""Uninterrupted"" sent a letter to Alabama addressing concerns over copyright infringement and intellectual property appropriation.  &gt;""The Shop"" was developed by James and ""Uninterrupted"" co-founder Maverick Carter. Its first episode, which premiered during the 2017 NBA Finals, generated approximately 4 million views across Uninterrupted.com and ESPN's YouTube channel, according to a copy of the letter obtained by ESPN.  &gt;""Your continued exploitation of 'Shop Talk' infringes 'Uninterrupted's' copyright, trademark rights and other valuable intellectual property rights in 'The Shop' and significantly damages 'Uninterrupted's' commercial prospects for 'The Shop,'"" the letter reads, in part.  &gt;The letter goes on to invite a conversation with Alabama before ""rushing into legal proceedings.""  &gt;The Crimson Tide, winners of two of the past three national championships with Saban at the helm, opened a barbershop in the football team's Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility in February and named it Bama Cuts.  Early today, Saban responded to LeBron during a [press conference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svgPaYqCkCA) A transcript of Saban's comments for those who don't want to watch it (although I highly recommend you do, it's classic Saban):  &gt;“No, I don’t have a reaction to it, I think LeBron James is a great player. There’s been at least 20 barbershop-type things I’ve seen on TV. I didn’t know anybody owned that. I didn’t even know he had one. I’m sorry that anybody could be offended by something that we were just having fun with. I enjoyed it, and we’re going to continue to do it.”  The video linked to this thread is LeBron's response to Saban. Once again for those who don't want to click, here is a transcript:  &gt;""I'll be damned if I allow someone to try and do the same thing we're doing and think it's ok.

"I just think it's hilarious he said this before Lebron's last 6 straight finals appearances.   The quote:  “Michael Jordan is probably the greatest scorer to play the game,” Pippen said. “But I may go as far as to say LeBron James may be the greatest player to ever play the game because he is so potent offensively that not only can he score at will but he keeps everybody involved. You have to be on your Ps and Qs on defense. No guy on the basketball court is not a threat to score with LeBron James out there. Not only will LeBron dominate from the offensive end as well, but he’s also doing it on the defensive end which really makes him the complete package. He’s able to get in those passing lanes, shoot those gaps and create transition opportunities where he is pretty much unstoppable.”"

Congrats to the Cavs for getting ruined by Golden State and going back to complete and utter irrelevance as a city and team without LeBron James 
Westbrook is 6'3 but his presence is LeBron James
Might just be that Lebron James is just really good at basketball...
"I got the real answer right here.  PG: Kemba Walker. Kemba has a good looking beard, his hair is great, his smile is genuine and beautiful. A really handsome man.  SG: Tyreke Evans. His hair game is Arnold strong. Not every picture shows how nice his beard and facial features are, but just look at [this!](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/920676525829128192/5Z7GK1YH_400x400.jpg) He is really good looking.  SF: Small forward got lots of guys. You got Paul George, Rudy Gay, Gordon Hayward, even LeBron is genuinely very handsome. But I the guy I'm picking here is just a freak. On the court, on the sheets and definitely when it comes to most handsome guy in the league discussions. Ladies and gentlemen, its Giannis Antetokounmpo. I think he might not be for everybody but good lord above he is for me.   PF: James Johnson. Not the biggest fan of neck tattoos, but apart from that he looks great. He's got great proportions in his body and face, his hair and beard are great and he oozes a masculine charisma that I really appreciate.  C: I got Kevin Love. Great hair, great beard, beautiful smile, great body, whats not to love? Someone might say he's not a center, but he is and there's nothing you can do about it so suck it. Honorable mention to Nerlens Noel who I happen to think looks really good.   "
"No he is not. I'll repeat, if you have to use ""well they suck more without him"" you can find shitty teams that would be dead last in the conference if not for chuckers. The cleveland cavaliers have had an embarrassing season and their star has coasted/quit for a portion of it. If you are continuing to gloss over that your bias sits quite strong. Also you seem pretty adamant with your argument, you should have been making a case every year then and not just when its suits to benefit LJ. In fact, look no further than 2015. Harden took a bunch of scrubs to the 2nd seed, that team had missed the playoffs 4 straight years before he got there just 2 years prior. GS is still a great team even without curry, therefore Harden is more valuable to the team. Again, you can find a guy every single season you can make this argument for.  -Also if you weren't to take team success into account what would you use? A guy chucking on the the worst team in the league doesn't mean anything. Translating your games to wins is how we measure success. I'll repeat...saying its not a ""team award"" is completely disingenuous...if you are not factoring how that best player is leading his teams to Ws you are interested in a completely wrong metric of success. Especially when a team is built for a guy, James Harden is the houston rockets.   Lastly, if the point has already been crystal clear that this is a question of unanimous vs non-unanimous...just go look at win shares. This isn't really debatable to be honest, the MVP voters that have voted for Lebron in the past will illustrate this clearly when they vote for JH."
The liberation of the eastern conference from the tyranny of the mad king LeBron James has been greatly exaggerated.

Well you can't compare a PG to Tim Duncan and Lebron James lol.   CP3's career averages are   18.7ppg 4.5 rpg and 9.8 ast  Compare that to the traditional best pg of all time Magic Johnson:   19.5 points 7.2 rpg and 11.2 apg.   Now let's take assist leader John Stockton:   13.1 ppg 2.7 rpg 10.5 apg  You can do this with every all time great PG and Chris Paul is right there.

"Harden is a lock. He is the MVP but LeBron is still a lot better overall, by far. I still like James Harden a lot though and that Rockets team is great."
Jose Calderon is out scoring Lebron James and Kevin Love right now
"That's what I'm trying to convey. Don't take it seriously. MVP isn't actually ''Most valuable player'' it's ''Best performing player of the season''. That is James Harden. The most valuable player, as an asset, is LeBron James.   If the MVP award was actually based on 'value' as a player you could theoretically give it to like an 18 year old rookie averaging like 20/5/5 with tremendous potential. Even though there's no way they're the best performing player."

"Lebron has a 1 billion dollar deal with Nike.  http://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-nike-deal-exceeds-1-billion-maverick-carter-says-2016-5  I wouldn't underestimate shoe money. I do agree with your statement about marketability, but a larger market could help him compensate his personality a little. Never on the level of LbJ or Steph though. "

"""Mental hurdle"" is a weird way to spell LeBron James  I think it would be a tough series for both teams"
"Well, yes Harden scores more per game (30.6 to 27.4) but eFG% goes to Lebron (58.8 to 53.7) rebounds go to Lebron (8.7 to 5.4) assists go to Lebron (9.1 to 8.8) and defensive rating goes to Lebron (111.3 to 105.0).  Harden takes PER slightly (29.8 to 28.6) and win shares (14.5 to 13.2) but advanced stats and a nickel will get you a gumball.  James has played 77 games so far, a whole Ferris Beuler's year's worth of absences more than Harden (NINE TIMES) and for the weak minded, Lebron has 17 triple doubles to Harden's 4.  Watching the games?  Harden gets any foul call he wants with his herky jerky style while Lebron never gets a call despite a tackle or two, and the stats bear that out 10.1 FTA to 6.3 (more than accounts for the PPG differential)  I understand people voting for Harden because of team success after all they have 15 more wins.  I just think there is absolutely no other argument than that for voting Harden over Lebron.  You are just voting for the Rockets over the Cavs. Come June, Harden voters could look pretty silly."
I don't remember seeing him outplay Miami LeBron. I think in 2013 and last year they had similar stats in a certain games but on average James had better overall per game numbers for those series.
"This chart shows the best season by age for any player in terms of VORP.  On the BS podcast the other week, KD said he's not surprised Lebron is this good 15 years into his career because he's ""only 33"".  I think some people have the perception that 33 is still within the prime window.  As far as the regular season goes, this shows that is clearly not true.  What Lebron has done this year at 33 hasn't been achieved by anyone 31 or older (2 years younger!).  And I think he'll surpass Karl Malone on the old side of the chart as well.  tl;dr:  Lebron James is decent"
"People talk about 33 years old as if that's still ""prime"" years.  Kevin Durant recently said that he isn't surprised Lebron is this good 15 years into his career because he's ""only 33"".  Lebron has created more value for his team this year than anyone 31 years or older ever has, and I expect him to break Karl Malone's longevity statistics that you can see in the chart as well.  Just wanted to post this to make sure y'all have heard of this Lebron James fella, he's decent."
Im mad because everyday I have to hear my coworker LeShannon tell me about how Lebron James is the best player off all time. I would not even put him in my top 5
"TT's contract isn't handicapping them, they were way in the luxury cap whether they gave him $16.5M which he got, or 10-12M like he deserved.  And you don't know they would've gotten TT still, what if he had sat out the year?  Or even half the year?  Are you willing to risk Lebron James leaving for $10M a year (with the luxury tax penalty) after he already left you for being cheap?  This is the same player that can force your hand in firing a coach with the best record in the league at the time, you think he's going to sit around and take having his team crippled and his best friend to made to look like a fool of an agent?"
"Okay GS can shoot but you're acting like this team doesn't have it's own strengths like 3 elite defensive players, and Lebron fucking James. "

"No matter what, Embiid and Simmons are going to give you a competitive window for the next decade (assuming health, reasonable roster construction/depth). Add Leonard/James and they are the favorite the next 2-3 years until Embiid/Simmons will be in their prime and really takeover. Lebron could be their fourth best player at age 36, with 2/3 top 15 guys in the league next to him. "
"Cuban offered 4 years, 70M.  Noel and his idiot agent thought he could get more - LeBron has/had nothing to do with this, and yes, I'm aware of the relationship between James and Rich Paul, Noel's agent."
LeBron James is in Cleveland... lol. It doesn't get any bigger than LeBron James.
"&gt;And for LeBron and the Cavaliers, there isn't much ambiguity as far as coaching decisions. What interim coach Larry Drew would do is the same as Lue would do—or you and I would do.  &gt;No matter who is wearing the nicest suit on the sideline, it's going to look something like this: During a 121-114 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on March 25, James came up the floor without the ball and motioned for Jordan Clarkson to get out of the corner. Clarkson obeyed, bringing the defense with him and allowing James to rush in for an easy alley-oop dunk.  &gt;I had nothing to do with that,"" Drew said with a smile after the game. ""That was all 'Bron. He recognized how they were playing the play that we were running, and he made the call out there and he got the alley-oop. He's been that coach on the floor for us all year long.""  &gt;His whole career, really.  &gt;""That's just who I am,"" James said. ""I feel like I'm an extension of our coaching staff. I take their commands and try to give them to our players out there on the floor. Just trying to see the game in multiple ways."""
"Pardon me, I guess I didn't see Lebron James on the ballot in 2016?"
"They literally weren't allowed to carry the ball like you can now. No AI crossovers, no James Harden step-daddies, no Lebron crab dribbles, etc"
"I think it's funny that had Lebron just taken his sabbatical instead of slumping in February, Lebron would have a better chance in the MVP race. People keep bringing up the string of games where he just stopped caring which is fair, but James Harden played half as many games in the same month because he got injured."
https://cavsnation.com/cavs-rumors-no-truth-lebron-james-coaching-cleveland/ yea right...
I don’t want to underplay Pau as a player but if Kobe Bryant isn’t on those teams they don’t make it past the first round. Dirk was the leading man on the Mavs when they took out Lebron James. He definitely didn’t win it single handedly but he is the reason they have a title.  By your standard Derrick Fisher &gt; Pau
"&gt; Not to mention he averages 3 less points then Harden but shoots north of 10% higher then him  They have almost identical True Shooting %, which accounts for 3-point shooting and free throw shooting.  LeBron James - .619  James Harden - .616"
"Average is ridiculous and you should delete or edit that. The guys been an animal this season. Don’t get me wrong I’d love Lebron as a Cavs fan, but I’d probably vote Harden if I had a vote. Guys deserves one. He’s worked his tail off this season and it shows. I’ve enjoyed every Rockets game I’ve watched this season and sometimes am just amazed at the shots he makes. James Harden deserves MVP. Plain and simple. "
Luka Doncic reminds me more of a James Harden than LeBron. A lot more finesse in his game than physicality.
"Boston and Cleveland are the worst.  Boston's just act like permanent martyrs to some nba led conspiracy to keep them at the bottom.  Cleveland's are just idiots.  Down by 30 points - ""LEBRON JAMES WITH THE MAMMA BAMMA SLAMMA TO BRING THEN WITHIN 28!!!!"""
"If I was a GM I would just call LeBron James every single day and ask him to come to my team in free agency, if he says no he says no, if he says yes he comes."
"That's a lofty prediction right there. LeBron James had a much better rookie season than the 21yr old ben Simmons, *at 18 years old.*"
"There was a record of 2 GM calling each other  for a quite big trade.    Basically GMs have their top lists of GMs they talk with a lot abiut everything.   Once the professional friendship is there, they can try and get better deals than the average.   So part of the small talk is aiming for the impossible and talk LeBron James just for the fun of it."
"Very fair. Also after checking their stats, I realized that Harden is only better than Lebron in scoring by 3 points while being outclassed in everything else while missing 11 games to James 0. Factoring in all that I wonder will Harden win now"
"I want the ""James Harden Runner up"" meme to continue   also Harden has another superstar on his team. if Steph and KD cancel each other out, Cp3 cancels Harden out enough that it put Lebron as the mvp"
"I think Harden should win the MVP but here is my go at an argument for Lebron James winning this year.  It comes down to the same argument really as to why James Harden deserved the MVP over Curry in the 2014-2015 season. Where it should go to a player who elevates their team to a higher level, as opposed to playing at a very high level on a superior team (Curry on the Warriors).   James Harden played on a team that went 56-26 in the west where the 2nd best Player (on paper) Dwight Howard only played 41 games. Despite having a not very great team, he was able to put up huge numbers and amazing performances, and brought his team to being a top seeded team in the West.   Now Lebron James has played on a very dysfunctional Cavilers, and appears to be on pace for a 50 win team. He is putting up monster stats (able to debate this is the best statistical year of his career), while the 2nd best player on the team, Kevin Love, has been injured for a lot of the year. Lebron has played in every game, and has had a huge roster shake up having had 6 players traded out, and 4 players brought in.   Despite a huge roster shake up, Lebron continues to put up monster stats, while taking his new team to a 16-8 record since the deadline. "
Yes hello it’s LeBron James u bum y’all need to striveforgreatness 🚀 jamesgang 
You can't say they are barely in playoff contention when they are currently the 3rd seed and clinched the playoffs. It shouldn't be a team award and it's not. It's a most valuable player award and Lebron James is the most valuable to his team arguably a guy in Milwaukee coming 2nd in that category. You wanna talk historic season then look at all the NBA records Lebron broke this year at 33 years old. Not to mention he averages 3 less points then Harden but shoots north of 10% higher then him. Yes I agree harden has had a good season but Lebron is more valuable to his team and the best player in the world. So I am confused what is the definition of MVP. Is it best player on best regular season team award? Or is it most valuable player. Not to mention he has played with 25 different starting lineups this season (NBA record) and every team in the east still wants to avoid them. 
"I think it's happening so frequently these days because there just aren't that many knock down 7 foot atheltic shooters in the history of the game. Having a 4 who can play big and spread the floor is such a premium these days guys who have that type of ceiling are super hyped and Dirk is the gold standard. Dirk's the protypical 4, in the same vein players were constantly getting compared to MJ in his post prime I think guys are gonna get compared to Dirk.   Dragan bender is a huge stretch but I find the kristaps, Lauri comps valid. They're obviously not as good as Dirk was yet but they both have that type of ability. I don't really think it's race thing Jonathan bender was another guy who's career was derailed but used to get those comps.   Here's some protypical players I think we'll always hear comparisons to in the coming decade that are probably a bit of stretch but we're seeing a good amount of comparisons to already.   Steph curry - Trae young   James harden- markelle fultz Kawhi Leonard- Josh Jackson  LeBron James- Ben Simmons  Kevin dursnt- Jonathan Issac  Al horford- Wendell Carter  Like these prospects def have some of the tools but they're still a long ways away and by the time they all realize their potential they'll probably be getting compared to different players. "
"&gt;[Spears] Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Cavs coach David Blatt hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Lebron is the singular focus of every defense and still puts up insane stat lines and has the exact same TS% and a higher EFF FG% than a guy who has an All NBA point guard beside him helping him facilitate and create easier buckets for him.   Defensively Lebron is a tad better than Harden because of his ability to switch between all 5 positions when he is engaged.   I just look at the surrounding casts and see that Lebron has had the same impact on the floor if not more with lesser players than James Harden. 
"How do we know this season LeBron has more impact?   They both score in a similar efficiency but Harden scores more, Almost 4 more ppg. They dish out at a similar rate also. Harden's defense THIS season is on par if not better than LeBron's.   So how do we know LeBron had more impact THIS season?   People keep on saying this but I don't see it. We all now that LeBron James has a significantly better career and impact over the course of his career than Harden bit we are referring to THIS SEASON."
"Phil Jackson - 2001 Lakers - LeBron James  Shaq, Kobe and LeBron would be unstoppable "
"Wait you really don't think Kawhi's resume by end of 2020 will qualify him for best in decade from 2010-2020?? I'm interested to know who your alternates will be. Durant, lebron, and steph curry can already be counted as 3 of the 5. Who will the last two be?   My insinuation is this: will James Harden or someone else finish that time period with a better resume than Kawhi has already?"

"The comment about reaching was actually more about that stat that somehow involved harden and Westbrook and the stats about him leading his team. You say the Cavs are a lottery team without him so him leading him team doesn’t mean much.  “You gotta give him the MVP! He’s played the most minutes and made the most field goals!” - no one ever  I’m not denying LeBron is having a lights out season. Unfortunately for him, James Harden is on another planet right now and he’s elevating everyone around him... all the way to first place. It’s just bad timing for LBJ."
"Some of the stats you posted may be true but are reaching a bit. LeBron has 190 more FGs than Harden while taking 111 attempts less than Westbrook?! What?! Who cares? Minutes played? Minutes per game? Are these supposed to be helping or hurting his cause?  You mentioned he leads Harden in rebounds. Of course he does since Harden is playing point. No one cares that LeBron has the 14th most rebounds in the league.  LeBron will score 800+ FGs this year... but average 3 ppg less than Harden. Harden is way more efficient. Work smart, not Hard(en).   You also included a bunch of stats that LeBron led his team in. Being the best player on your team doesn’t make you MVP. He’s definitely the MVP of his team. I’ll give you that.  Harden is: - scoring leader (30.6 ppg) - first in 3s made - second in 3s per game, after only the greatest shooter to ever play the game - third in Assists after LeBron but still very impressive scoring that many points with that many assists - seventh in steals which is incredible for someone who “doesn’t play defense” - first in PER. PER has its flaws but for prolific offensive players like Harden and James, it’s a pretty good measure.   Additionally, the Rockets locked up first place in the league with 6 games left. The Cavs are third in the East, sixth overall. We also put together a 17 game winning streak and I think a couple 10+ game steaks this season. End of story.  tl:dr a lot of those stats you posted are meaningless to the MVP debate"
"i don't think we can vote on hypotheticals. If LeBron James was in D'antoni's Rockets systems would he be having a better season than Harden? We don't know but the media can't vote like that. Is KAT more gifted than LaMarcus? Potentially, although LMA has a lot of experience that helps. But that's not important. Pop is a great coach, imo the best ever, but coaching should not take anything away from the player."
This poll conducted this past August has Kobe favored over Lebron 60&gt;40  http://www.espn.com/sportsnation/story/_/id/20227321/sportsnation-how-rank-lebron-james-kobe-bryant
"100%  Look, if people want to argue James had the best season that year, they were probably right. But Rose led a far less talented Bulls team to 60 wins, and absolutely balled out.  It was clear LeBron was still the best player in the world, but Rose earned that one"
&gt; but I obviously feel James is the leader in the clubhouse on that front.   So give it to LeBron James Harden
Lebron James will fight for his children (Haven't you heard? He's a father of 3).
"1.  That Westbrook's MVP wasn't deserved.  It was divided, but a lot of people thought Westbrook deserved the MVP (for non triple double reasons).  Hell [reddit voted him MVP by a huge margin](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6jgdzy/rnba_season_awards_voting_results/dje0y74/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=nba).  This is all because Westbrook has dissapointed (relatively) this year and Harden has taken it up a notch, but guess what?  That's not how MVP works.  2.  That Curry was robbed of the 2015 FMVP.  Here is the [voting for finals MVP](https://twitter.com/Rachel__Nichols/status/611028765456637952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxsports.com%2Fnba%2Fstory%2Fandre-iguodala-wins-finals-mvp-lebron-james-7-4-vote-total-golden-state-warriors-champs-061615&amp;tfw_creator=foxsports&amp;tfw_site=foxsports).  Now it's likely the Iggy voters colluded to make sure a Warrior won, but regardless Curry was clearly 3rd in the pecking order, and at the time everyone thought either Lebron or Iggy deserved it.    3.  That Lebron deserved the 2011 MVP.  There were 2 different opinions back then.  There was the old school basketball media that thought Rose deserved it because he improved so much on a team that was the #1 overall seed (also injuries to Boozer/Noah and they were the surprise team), and there was the advanced stat media that thought Dwight Howard deserved it.  Back then advanced stats wasn't as much of a thing so Rose won it easily.  If the voting had happened in the current climate I think it would be a close vote between those 2.  "
Probably Lebron James
"But he had more than enough talent to win a championship and didnt. He can be half-forgiven for the 2012 finals against the heat because, while he was the vegas favorite, he was playing against lebron motherfucking james. But it seems to be the consensus that OKC was the best team in the playoffs in 2016, and they got upset in a 3-1 comeback."

You said it yourself its only offensive if it’s disrespectful. It is pretty easy for someone to tell if it is in disrespect. And no not in those words but i say a lot of things like “fucking straight people” and “what kind of losers are straight” anymore. Im just saying intent is what matters and its pretty easy to tell someones intent. Someone straight saying “thats gay” is disrespectful(unless its super close friends joking around then I personally don’t mind but in general stuff that uses it as a derogatory term is bad but I feel we as a society are moving away from that  anyways) But my straight friends joking around asking me to cuddle or saying something like “Lebron james is daddy” or something akin to that just isn’t bad to me.  In our society over the past 2-3 years or so we are seeing a lot less of the first and more of the second(in my experience at least) and I have no problem with that.

Sixers can take on more shooters. And it's silly to think Simmons won't work on his shot relentlessly this summer.  Cavs beat Warriors because of one guy named LeBron fucking James. And in this scenario he would be on the Sixers.
No experience? Bruh in this scenario they just bounced LeBron James put of the playoffs. They're probably going to the finals. 
"Belinelli was super hot fire from beyond the arc last night, all of the Sixers play for at least the first half was phenomenal really..

"it's way too dense and sticks out too far from his face, it looks like matted pubic hair or something. also if he had an actual mustache like Harden it wouldn't look so bad but he opts to keep it pencil thin. [he looked way cooler with just a mustache too](http://www.ferrvor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lebron-James-Profile.jpg) but I guess he doesn't want to be accused of ripping off MJ's facial hair style"
How is Tristan Thompson not the LVP - but actually LeBron James for getting him this contract
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"&gt; How can a stat be fulfilling?  If you can look at a stat and feel confident in the conclusion you draw, there´s a sense of fulfillment there. However, basketball box score stats tend to feel incomplete. There´s so much going on in a basketball game that doesn´t show up in stats.  &gt; Basketball is great because stats can't show everything  I agree that basketball is great, but statistics are not great in basketball. You seem to agree with me and disagree with Bill Simmons.  &gt; You're not watching the stats, you're watching the fucking game...  Unfortunately, some of us have lives and don´t have time to watch every Michael Jordan game and every Lebron James game to compare them. So we are left looking at stats."
Look past his 30-8-5 at his assist % or potential assists. It tells you how poorly the rest of the team shot.  Pop took advantage of james sure but there's like a handful of teams equipped to stop lebron and the heat like that all time. The reason why they run the offence like (I.e. through James) is because he is/was one of the best ever at finishing and kicking when the help rotates. Not every team has 2 elite wing defenders and a tim duncan playing amazing basketball for any age.
"I totally agree that we should give the Spurs credit, but to me, regardless of how well the spurs played that series, if Miami had played to 80% of their potential, they would have hd the series comfortably.  The spurs system outclassed the Miami system.  This is where I think Lebron is at fault.  Lebron plays a ball dominant style and dictated the offensive flow, including how Wade and Bosh got their touches.  You can argue they came up short, but there was no adjustment made to get them in rhythm beyond a few first quarter bosh postups and Wade briefly playing the point without James. Wade was basically the garbage man that series and it really threw him off to only be scoring in transition and late clock situations. Bosh was just there to space the floor at that point.  Pop took advantage of James' play style and picked them apart, and Kawhi had a great series defending him. If James was able to play a more team oriented game, we'd probably see much more strain on the heat, but as it was they gave Lebron the midrange and mostly stayed single coverage on drives.  That's way too simple a defense to be hamstrung by.  Lebron didn't really have his usual MVP-type of numbers. He was something like 30-8-5 with good shooting (he was incredible from 3, iirc), which he can do rolling out of bed. Lebron can have a legitimately poor game putting up those numbers and that's what happened for 3 games. That's why the Spurs won.  About the defense, Miami was a swarming type of defense.  Trap hard, switch everything and rotations completely on point.  Current Lakers defense reminds me of that, except we suck and aren't even close (I so wish we were). The thing is Pop took advantage of how reactionary it was and laid out a game plan based on the fact that they didnt handle cutters well. It's a failure of Miami's defense that they didn't adapt to that. "
"In what world are the 76ers crushing the Warriors with James?  The idea that the Rockets are anywhere close to the Warriors right now, or that the Sixers + Lebron would even be better, is just fucking unreal to me. This current Rockets team is not as good as the Warriors team from 2016. It’s maybe as good as the 2015 Warriors.  The Warriors won 73 games and people were debating whether they outclassed the ‘96 Bulls as the best team of all time (until the playoff upset). And then, after all that happened, they added Durant on top of it. "
"Jordan was a scorer. KAJ has 3xs more rebounds and 4xs more blocks than Jordan, but you wouldn't use solely as arguing KAJ &gt; MJ.  KAJ is the overall points leader in the NBA.

LeBron James
"Lebron James’ PER this year is 28.7. And Jordan averaged more steals and scored more points, and was selected to first team defense that year.   There’s more to the game than offense, just FYI.   Jordan was more complete. Deal with it. "
"Incredibly ugly. Ben Simmons, Gordon Hayward, LeBron James, DeMar DeRozan. All BEAUTIFUL players who aren’t fucking BABIES like the Wizards. I respect them."
"I think it's possible. It requires so much hard work and knowledge of the game to break down what appears to be a very simple sport and uncover all its complexities but that's why I said it's an ideal. We do have sportswriters who try to do exactly that though. Have a peek at Ben Taylor's ongoing series where he attempts to rank the 40 greatest  careers in NBA history.  http://www.backpicks.com/2017/12/11/the-backpicks-goat-the-40-best-careers-in-nba-history/  Even if you don't read anything else, at least try to read his summary (what this list is not, what this list is, thinking basketball etc.) of what exactly he is attempting to do with his list. I think it lays out all the principles all sports analysts should keep in mind when they go about their jobs.  Edit: I think you'll be pleased to know he's ranked LeBron James very very highly in that list."
"Mj is the greatest of his era, kobe after him, LeBron greatest after kobe, and really hard to say who will wind up being the greatest after lebron, James harden?  Giannis?  What if the sixers shock the world, embiid stays healthy, Ben Simmons could be next in line."
"Tbf James Harden's offense more than makes up for his defense (which has drastically improve over recent years). That said, Kawhi works more within the Spurs system than I can see Harden doing, though if you guys can keep him is the real question. Offseason will be hella exciting this year if both LeBron and Kawhi move though."
"I don't remember the last time he lost a game in the first round....  EDIT:  It was 2012 where he lost ONE game. In the 2 years since this post, he swept the Pistons and the Pacers last year. https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/4/17/11446770/lebron-james-playoffs-first-round-stats-wow-he-is-good"

"This is cool.  Part of it is abnormally high usage for a rookie.  I wanted to see how this stacked up, so I filtered by per game stats of 16+ pts, 6+ rebs and 1.5+ 3pts and limited it to players under the age of 25, just to see where that would end up and see some potential comps.

Lebron James Jr mad jealous right now
"&gt;  ""ceiling similar to a Lebron James""  While I do think his ceiling is pretty high, I don't see him ever aproaching or coming close to aproach lebron's level. I mean lebron when he was younger than Simmons is now was already a first team All NBA player top 3 individual player in the league and was scoring 31 a game at 20 years old. I mean Simmons might not have the highest ceiling in his own team Embiid is also an insane talent I swear to god if the 76ers manage to screw this thing up, especially after the shameful start of decade they had I will be super pissed, I mean they have everything to build a powerhouse"
"&gt; Ask yourself, if the Rockets lose this year to the Warriors, won't all of r/nba be calling it another Harden/CP3 choke job?  uhh, no. at a minimum it depends on the circumstances. if they go up 3-2 or something and play horrible maybe, but there are a lot of scenarios where i wouldn't remotely consider it choking. the warriors have maybe the best roster ever.  &gt;Enough talent to win 60+ games and get the one seed but apparently not enough talent to live up to one seed expectations.   the number 1-5 reasons they won 60 games was lebron james. and he played beyond what you can reasonably expect in that series. is he supposed to average 45 a game? is that reasonable?"
"As a Raptors fan, I Dislike Lebron. But I will take nothing away from him. He is nothing short of amazing. He is one of the greats. That being said I don't believe he should be brought up with him as the greatest ever. I think people are too quick to put him over even some of the other greats. I honestly right now wouldn't say he is better than bird or magic. imo anyway, or kareem for that matter. The thing I don't understand though is that people love to show lebrons amazing stats. "" THE MAN COULD AVERAGE A TRIPPLE DOUBLE IF HE REALLY WANTED TOO"" but then when the likes of Westbrook actually does average a tripple double(although be it with a lot worse shooting splits and higher usage rate) but they treat that like its just a really good player. If it was lebron that averaged a triple last season or even this season, they would be calling him jordans dad, he would be a fucking god as far as people could see today. But when westbrook and james harden break the stats boxes they are just really good players."
"LeBron James had 44 points, 12 Assists, 11 Rebounds &amp; 2 Steals.  But he also had 9 turnovers, 11 missed free throws &amp; his team lost.   He also played for forty minutes and had zero fouls.  This is why reading a box score isn't the same as watching a game. Sorry I missed this one."
"Wow so many generational talents.   Simmons, KAT, Embiid, Giannis, AD, Kawhi, Curry, Harden, Durant    Oh wait.. none of them are generational talents   LeBron James is a generational talent, as was Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain     We might not have another generational talent for a decade or two "
LeBron James Takes Over in Cavaliers Win Over Wizards! Cavaliers vs Wizards
"&gt; It’s a prediction based on regular season performance, including an analysis of the best player on their team and how they have performed during the regular season.  Do you have a source on this? If it’s going to be taken into account for MVP voting, it has to be quantifiable. If there are consensus metrics based solely on this season that show that the Cavs are a better team than the seeds in front of them despite having a worse record, that could be taken into account.  &gt; If Bron’s number were diminishing across the board and it looked like he lost a step, do you really think people would still be saying the Cavs are favorites to make the finals?   My qualm with this point is that it again relies on the fact that we know what Lebron has done in previous years, due to the fact that we’re talking about his numbers and quality of play diminishing in comparison to peak Lebron, hence before this season. My main point here is that, to be objective about MVP voting, we need to stay away from any “...because he’s *Lebron fucking James*” reasoning. It’s tough because he’s obviously the best player in the league, but we need quantifiable factors based on this regular season alone.  &gt; Another example, we’re talking about the Rockets being a finals contender, but definitely not because Harden’s elevated level of play in the playoffs.  He scores less, assists less and turns the ball over more in the playoffs historically.  I agree with you there, and I’d put my money on the Warriors any day. But that still doesn’t mean that we can factor in playoff history into an award that is purely based on the 2017-2018 regular season. If we were voters for the MVP award, we would need to effectively erase previous seasons from our memory. That’s the goal of an objective MVP decision.  &gt; As for regular season standings being the barometer of a player’s regular season success (and MVP viability) that’s absurd.  Russ won the MVP last year finishing 6th in the West.  I’m sure you also remember the uproar making this exact point about why many thought that he shouldn’t have won. It was an unprecedented move to give the MVP to a player on such a low-seeded team. Historically, MVPs have been almost exclusively on high-seeded teams. Westbrook was an odd exception to the rule of thumb.  I also disagree with the notion that record doesn’t reflect player value. We can agree that, in the NBA, value = winning. There’s no value in losing. The “most valuable player” in the league is therefore the player that contributes to overall winning more than any other player in the league. So that necessitates that the amount of wins that a player/team gets is important. If your team doesn’t win much, why are you valuable? Example: AD is an MVP-level player. However, his team might not even make the playoffs. Would you feel comfortable giving the title of “most valuable” to a player on a team that didn’t even win enough games to make playoffs? What value did they really bring if not contributing to a significant amount of wins?   &gt; I’m not going to - and it doesn’t make sense to - think about what quantifiable factors make a fourth seed more like to be in the ECF than a second or third  Fair enough. But while we’re on this point — I want to question the premise that we’re working with here to begin with. If the MVP is an award that’s defined as the most valuable player within a regular season, should making it to the ECF/Finals even be a thought, as a voter? I would personally argue that an objective voter should effectively pretend that the playoffs don’t exist. This seems unintuitive to us at first — we know that the greatest value of all is winning the championship. *However*, until the *very definition* of what constitutes the MVP award is altered to include postseason, why should we say that our personal idea of value (postseason success) supersedes the official definition of what constitutes a player deserving of MVP? I think this is actually a really important point.  &gt; ook at the Hawks in 2015.  Best record in the East.  You gonna tell me Paul Millsap or Al Horford deserves MVP consideration over Lebron?  That’s crazy.  Of course not. That’s why we look at player stats primarily and team success as context. Which of Al Horford or Paul Millsap had Harden-esque stats?  In the case of this season, Harden has arguably slightly better individual stats imo (3ppg higher on equivalent TS%, only 0.5 lower AST, less rebounds which imo is the least important) and his team has the best record in the league. To me, the stats at this point could be considered close enough to call it a tie, but the record discrepancy between the two teams seals the tiebreaker in Harden’s favor. The difference between the Rockets and Cavs record is 3x the difference between even the Cavs and the Pelicans record, to tie AD’s season back into this.  I of course agree that it would be ridiculous to say that Lebron doesn’t have a chance over Harden, but I maintain that it should be Harden for all the reasons listed above.  I agree    "
Lebron James becomes the youngest and oldest player in NBA history with _______
Q: Why can't Lebron James shop at the dollar store?   A: Because he only has 3 quarters!  Once upon a time these were everywhere in the internet.    
[Welcome to the playoffs!](https://cavsnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lebron-james-mad.jpg)
"The issue isn't that LeBron can't play off-ball (he can), the issue is that it's really hard to maximize both players when they are both most effective with the ball in their hands. If the ball is in Simmons's hands, then it's not in the hands of LeBron James. If the ball is in LeBron's hands, then Simmons has to be doing something else that he's not as good at (because we've established that he is an elite passer or very soon will be one).   The lack of spacing among a LeBron-Embiid-Simmons big 3 would make for a weird fit. LeBron can shoot, obviously, but Embiid isn't Love (his 30.8% shooting from 3 is .7% better than Marcus Smart, for example) and Simmons obviously isn't a guy you can space out like Love.   I'm not sure how it fits together exactly is my issue. Is LeBron going to defer to Simmons as the primary ballhandler and also allow Embiid to dominate the paint while he (LeBron) waits on the perimeter for a kick-out pass? Is Simmons coming off the bench as a super-sub or with very specific lineups with more shooting? idk, I just know that it's not a completely intuitive fit and would be a challenge for Brett Brown to figure out. "
I mean look at this - http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/LeBron+James+Miami+Heat+v+Charlotte+Bobcats+4QcaT0ombm1l.jpg  His jumpshots almost look like soccer throw-ins sometimes
He's putting up 17 and 9 as a second option (to LeBron fucking James) on 61 TS%
"As complete as Lebron James did? I don’t remember Lebron ever having 10 scoring titles, and be selected to nine All NBA Defensive First teams, and lead the league in steals three times.  But that’s just me. "
"In my highly-respected expert basketball opinion, Lebron James' free throw routine needs some tweaking. The routine (dribble dribble, spin the ball in the left hand, *then* shoot) unsquares him from the rim. "
"Alright listenhereulittle shit, straight up.... do you think james harden is better at the game of basketball than lebron?"
"Other than the first Curry year Lebron probably should have been MVP every year.  Did a quick check and including this year if he doesn't win this would be the fifth time he'd lead in BR VORP and not win MVP. Not sure how that stat is calculated but it's been dead on the last 5 years for picking the leader. Culprits for stealing an MVP from James include Kobe, Dirk, Nash, and Rose. And Harden this year if Harden wins. At this point I just think MVP is Lsbron this year. 9 more games of Lebron vs Harden is just too much of a difference with how good Lebron has been. Put differently, Harden was not 9 games better than Lebron this year. Plus, take Lebron off this Cavs team and they win like 15 games the whole year, considering how much time Love missed, and with basically nobody else on the roster who can dribble."

"From his rookie year to age 31, Larry Bird led his team in assists per game 3 years out of 9 years.  From his rookie year to age 31, LeBron James led his team in assists per game 12 out of 13 years (8 of his 9 years on the Cavs, 4 of his 4 years on Miami).  Call him the small forward, the power forward, or the pink polka-dotted giraffe, LeBron James has been the main ball-handler on his team his whole career.  Larry Bird was small forward from his first minute played as a Sycamore to his last minute played as a Celtic.  Larry did what a small forward does better than LeBron.  That doesn't mean Larry is the better player, but it does make him the better small forward."
"sorry man but Lebron is clutch asf for sure. Clutch shots don't always just mean the last buzzer beater. Sometimes the most clutch shots in the game are the ones that keep you from falling behind even more. For example, a huge steal and dunk in the 2nd quarter could be the most clutch play of the game. If the opposing team is in the middle of a scoring-run the dunk could stifle their moral and stop their run, essentially saving you the game.   Some statistics showing that Lebron is just as clutch and that you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.   https://twitter.com/WindhorstESPN/status/597577262033014784  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/lebron-james-michael-jordan-clutch-undisputed-skip-bayless-shannon-sharpe-100716  Also capitalizing words doesn't make you sound more convincing.

"I've been in jail for 17 years, is Lebron James the best player in the NBA?"
"&gt; give me the guy who scored 5 more points on the same efficiency every time  There's no reason to believe LeBron couldn't score 5 more easily on the same efficiency if he was less of a passing threat like Jordan was  &gt; MJ might be the greatest guard defender the game has ever seen.  It's easy to say that about a guy who played in the same system his entire career next to the best perimeter defender in the game. LeBron has had to deal with much more variety throughout his career and has shown an incredible ability to adapt as recently as the 2015 finals when he turned that beaten down team into an elite defensive group.  &gt; Bruh what? How TF did you say that scoring was even despite MJ averaging 3 more on the same effiency but say that LeBron has the edge over MJ in rebounding when LeBron is averaging 1 more a game while being 3 inches taller? Your bias is showing  Jordan doesn't get bonus points for being shorter. Your bias is showing. Also, LeBron average nearly 3 more a game in the playoffs and just has the ability to be a more dangerous rebounder when the situation calls for it due to his physical advantages. Look at his finals numbers to confirm this.  &gt; Ok we're done here, you are so biased it's not even funny. LeBron is constantly passive aggressive, petty, and taking shots at his teammates and coaching staff. That's not a leader. A leader doesn't bail on a 60+ win team because he loses to the Magic. And then goes to ring chase again.  A leader does lead by example and bring his team back from a 3-1 deficit against an historically great team.   A leader does consistently elevate average role players and make them key contributors. (Mo Williams, Damon Jones, Daniel Gibson, Drew Gooden, Chris Anderson, Mario Chalmers, Mike Miller, James Jones, Matthew Dellavedova, etc)   A leader does not punch his teammates in the face.  Still, I admit they're different styles and we can throw this one out if you want.  The final score is still 2 - 1 in favor of LBJ."
"Larry Bird from his rookie year to age 31 (his last healthy year): 25 points and 10 rebounds on 50-38-88 shooting splits.   LeBron from his rookie year to 31: 27 points and 7 rebounds on 50-34-74 shooting splits.   LeBron had 2 more points on identical shooting from the field, 4% worse from three, and 14% worse from the line.  He also had 3 fewer rebounds.  As I said, a small forward has to score, defend, and rebound the ball.  Larry Bird was a better **small forward** than LeBron James, but LeBron was the better player.  Just because LeBron nominally played at the small forward position, but was his team's point guard his whole career does not mean he gets to go down as the better small forward than a guy who played at small forward in an era where guys played their positions to the letter."

"They did adjust eventually and start doubling James and scrambling back. That's how they won in the end, force it from LeBron and they let Osman be the guy. That third quarter was bizarre though, can't imagine why they didn't even have Simmons try to fight through the screens."
"First of all, a 40 win team is still a lottery team in the East. The 8th seed right now has 42 wins and the season isn't even over.    Second of all, you think Lebron fucking James is only worth like 10 wins? Stop.    And finally, acting like Kevin Love is the difference between being in the lottery and being a playoff team is laughable considering where he was before Cleveland. "
"Of course that's what makes it highly subjective.   I do find it funny that LeBron fans argue that he was robbed by Derrick Rose for the 2011 MVP, when it D-Rose led a clearly less talented supporting cast to more wins than the Heat. Now that LeBron has the less-talented supporting case in relation to James Harden, it becomes ""well look at their respective teammates.""   I think you have to be consistent and reward team success in MVP voting."
LeBron James is still the greatest player of all time minus his freethrows and the Sixers are the 3rd seed in the east.
"I mean, he kept getting left alone with fucking LeBron James. He wasn't great but Roco is really the only guy I trust on LeBron."
"Sixers had to switch cause the cavs run shooters everywhere and LeBron was unguardable on 1v1 vs fucking Marco Bellinelli, while the 76ers have their elite rim protector sitting on the bench with a suit.  He's the best player in this generation. But cmon man, Bellinelli cannot guard CP3s son, let alone LeBron James.  Covington did a really good job on James in the first half, before the Cavs tried to PnR with guards to get switches.  He was 4-12 with 5 turnovers when guarded 1v1 by Covington/ Ben.  He was GOD-GOD with a few turnovers when guarded by Bellinelli."
You're getting downvoted but you're absolutely right. We all see it. Its the LeBron James coalition

"His team also went down by 30 under him. You gotta take the bad with the good.  In the end of the day, wins are what matters. He lost the game, therefore this isn't a showing of how he should be MVP over James Harden, a man who wins his games way more than Lebron with better stat lines."

"James with 37, scoring the last 11 points for Cleveland.  76ers during the second half have 33 points. LeBron has 28 in the 2nd half."
"It’s like at halftime he sat there and went, “wait a minute, I’m Lebron James”"

I enjoy watching LeBron James play basketball.
But I wouldn’t call Rondo the smartest guy in the nba when you have guys like Chris Paul and Lebron James out there. 
"Ya, but it works when you have Lebron James isolating because when breaks down the defense, he makes phenomenal playmaking decisions when teams send help. Lillard will shoot no matter what"
"1. Genuinely bad teams will never get better, even getting good players, until they change their culture \(see Barry Sanders\).  2. If your front office is bad, the team will be bad. \(see Lebron James, 1st stint w/ Cavs\).  3. No, because nobody likes watching bad basketball. The whole point of the NBA is to see great basketball. Let's reward teams that at least try to play great basketball even with crappy players. Let's reward those teams. A team that strives to play great even with crappy players will get better when you add a great player. Crappy franchises will not get better with better players. Let's reward good basketball only."
"Ya, but Portland doesnt have a Lebron James he can play off of "
"Fucking Jrue ""Lebron James"" Holiday "
"Gotta disagree here. First off, Magic’s assists totals are inflated by the pace of the 80s. Adjust LeBrons stats to a similar pace and you’ll see what I mean. Nothing against Magic here but they played in an extremely quick era, even Stockton’s numbers are inflated from that time period.   An easy example of why something as arbitrary as “double digit assists” shouldn’t be counted is Westbrook. He’s got at least 2 or 3 seasons at 10apg(and I think another above 9). Do you think WB is better than Lebron at passing? I don’t and I love the guy. Beyond that we have to look at who their passing to. Magic Johnson came into the league with Kareem on his team and then they added James Worthy and Dennis Scott lol. Westbrook was passing to Harden/KD. Who was LBJ passing to 03-10? Still above 7 assists per despite half his career playing with subpar offensive players. I think there’s a lot more to consider on the ‘who’s a better passer argument’ than simply stats otherwise Stockton is the goat at it and no one comes close(which I don’t necessarily agree with but wouldn’t have a problem with).  Moving on, since we started on statistics by your choice tell me why you think Kidd is above LeBron? Same Kevin Johnson and Tim Hardaway? Imo I’d have Mark Jackson above all of them but Kidd and somehow you’ve got both of them over LeBron lol. I don’t agree with IT either but don’t know enough about it to counter to be honest(I think LeBron has much better career stats but Zeke had a short career but I don’t ever remember him being an “all time” passer conversations which to me suggests he’s not as great as you think but I’m on mobile atm so I can’t really check). Big O I never saw play but his stats are the most inflated of anyone’s. When they adjusted to pace with BigO, WB averaged like 5 extra assists a game or some nonsense. Not that the guy wasn’t an atg, but he’s not comparable in this scenario.  Thoughts? Dissenting opinions?  Edit: didn’t comment on Rondo. For all the hate WB gets there is no known greater stat padder than Rondo and assists per game imo. He’s always held the ball extremely long amounts of time, he seeks assists on what should be fast break lay ups for himself, and hell just watch some of his time on the Kings where he lead the league in assists that didn’t translate at all to wins. Again the guy is clearly a talented passer but he’s not LeBron."
"You guys aren’t getting it.  Take the Detroit Lions, for instance.  They sucked. They drafted an amazing, world class talent in Barry Sanders. They still sucked. They never changed the culture because they were rewarded for sucking.  The Cleveland Cavaliers.  The sucked. They were rewarded with sucking with Lebron James. They still didn’t win because they didn’t change the culture. They finally did when Lebron returned.  You have to change the culture. Franchises must be forced to do this.  Also, you guys would rather luck and chance play a big part of the sport with the lottery. Why not let them settle it all on the court? That’s the whole point, right... Basketball?!?!"

"This comment thread is absolutely insufferable; the potential that Ben has is extremely high, but already calling him a ""better passer"" than Lebron is stupid af, especially when the claim is ""Well, Lebron dribbles it at the top of the key for 8 sec and then whips a pass.""  Wtf, first that's not true. Second, Lebron James is hands down one of the best scorers in the league. Of course, the ball's should remain in his hands since it's almost an automatic bucket..."

"&gt;Not as a rookie.     LOL it shows y'all kids just started watching basketball, and know no fucking history. Pathetic   &gt;  You think LeBron is a God now? Imagine him 10x more visibly athletic and playing non stop defense and offense, without any break. That's Young Bron  &gt;  Dude averaged a 32 point triple double in his first ever playoff game. He averaged like 35-8-8 on 55% shooting in his first ever playoff series.  &gt;  And guess what? Ben Simmons is 21. LeBron entered the league at age 18 and was doing all that shit..   &gt;  Bron at age 22, just a year older than Ben is now, carried a trash ass Cavs team filled with Varejao and Mo Williams, to the fucking NBA finals LMAO    &gt;   That's LeBron James. Educate yourself first, and then talk, ya bum. Fuck outa here"
This is blasphemy. What we aren't going to do is call Simmons a better passer than LeBron fuckin' James after one playoff game.
"I agree with that, but even if it was a crapshoot, there's still no reason to NOT try to get as high of a pick as you can. In the NFL if you can sneak into the playoffs you have at least a small chance to compete for a title. In the NBA, competition is an illusion for anyone who isn't a super team or has LeBron James.   There's just no incentive for most teams to make the effort to compete when they literally have a 0% chance to win a title. "

LeBron James
1. Michael Jordan 2. Serge Ibaka . . . . . . . 3. Lebron James 
"I think he'll eventually start at PG, and Ben Simmons will move to SF and be that point forward type a la LeBron James, Antetokounmpo, Turkoglu, etc."
"There’s only 5 guys on the court at a time. Having the “best” guy on the court is incredibly valuable.  Cleveland won a championship against the best regular season team of all time just because Lebron James is really fucking good. The nba is the most unique in that regard. If you don’t have a top 10 player in the league your chances of winning it all are virtually 0.  Because of how crazy top heavy the league is tanking is the preferred way to build talent. You can’t compete against the James harden, Lebron James, Steph Curry’s of the league. So if you don’t have that type of player you really just have to hope that you draft the next best all star.   This leads to a bunch of teams competing for the #1 pick because that’s the best chance of getting an all generational talent, and having one of those caliber players is really the only way to actually win a ring"
Ben Simmon's upcoming career... i'm finally going to learn what it felt like to root against Lebron James. 
Hes lebron James not some rookie
Lebron James shaking my soda 
"Keep it real, he only won Finals MVP because he was checking LeBron. His numbers weren't indicative of a Finals MVP. Duncan had arguably better numbers, and Parker scored more than Kawhi. Kawhi won by basically ""holding"" LeBron to 30/8/4/2 on 57% shooting.    This exact thing happened again in 2015 when Igoudala won FMVP.  Interestingly, Durant won FMVP for checking James as well (better numbers though)... so the point it, you have a pretty good chance at winning FMVP if you win and you're guarding LeBron. "
"I mean, we’re comparing LeBron James to Rajon Rondo here. If it were Kobe or Jordan or Curry - actual primary options who get doubled all the time are the focus of every defensive game plan, then I’d see your point.   But no, Rondo was literally being given open jump shots and got a ton of low resistance layups because the defense was more concerned with the help around him. Meanwhile James is being smothered by both his initial defender and Kevin Garnett.  The Cavs were not close to the best defense in the league back then, and that they won so many games is a testament to James."
"I did watch the games. No, Rondo did not command the full attention of the defense and you seem to acknowledge this with mention of KG/Allen/Pierce  &gt; (if they didn't double, it had more to do with the fact that a team with Ray/PP/KG and any competent center is basically un-doubleable).  Correct. Rondo was given the freedom to shoot jumpers from wherever he wanted and 1on1 scoring opportunities at the rim. I can’t equate that performance with what LeBron had to face. That Boston team is arguably the best defense of the era.  I invite you to show me some film of Rondo successfully defending James in the series. I recall scattered possessions in the years they’ve played one another, but in that series Rondo wasn’t much of a deterrent against James."

How many WNBA players would it take to defeat a team of a prime Dikembe Mutombo and Lebron James.
"This is why Lebron spends 7 figures a year on his body.   This is why even when he coasts, he never fucks around too long before returning to form.  Because 'Playoff P' is something you can summon sometimes but if you're not about it all day, all night, all year then 'Playoff P' is only gonna show up 3 nights out of 7 instead of 4 , because he didn't respect his competition until it was too late on some Aesop's fables shit (to be fair, those 3 nights are fucking bonkers, and the reason we all think of PG as a superstar and inconsistent, unfulfilled potential at the same time).   Yeah, you can turn it on against top talent, but when you run into guys who are just as talented but who are willing to put more work into preparation you're always gonna be 'Playoff P' instead of Lebron '7 Straight Finals' 'King' James.  Donovan Mitchell is young but he's already performed more consistently over the course of a season than PG ever has, AND he's leading a team to the playoffs in the West while performing better in his first year than PG did in his first through fourth year in terms of individual AND team success.  tl;dr Playoff P bout to eat that Playoff D, [pleezbaleevit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCZ4DSgpRtE)"
"?  Not sure what I’ve said here is unfair. Rondo absolutely did not face the defensive pressure that James did. He did a great job of taking advantage of the openings Cleveland ceded to him in order to defend other options, but rarely did he have to break through multiple defenders to score like LeBron on most possessions, because Boston knew he didn’t have help."
"#GetOffRussDick  You're witnessing greatness. You can't stat pad for the entire season. Westbrook is just a gifted player, he can do multiple things on the court that a average pg just can't do.  When it's all said and done we might look at Westbrook as the most athletic freak athlete in NBA history and that includes Lebron.  Westbrook is averaging more rebounds/assist than Lebron James, let that sink in..."
"Hahaha that’s your comeback? Shit son I was born and bread in Cleveland. You are taught about being irrelevant in sports from the time you are born. Are fucking river caught on fire for days. I lived through The Drive, The Fumble, The Shot, Jose fucking Mesa, Lebron James leaving, Tristan Thompson’s mass infidelity, Tamar Rice, living next to Pennsylvania, Ricky Kirk and David Blatt.   I laugh at being irrelevant. It’s like water of my back. Go back to remembering watching Trailer Park Boys, drinking shitty beer and remembering that if you get through the first round you will still have a Lebron Dad Dicking coming. "

"I'm pretty sure a star wouldn't do that, rare exceptions. Like, you have to completely focused to become a LeBron James/Steph Curry/James Harden, I doubt someone so focused would be unprofessional enough to get high and go to a game"
"Get the fuck outta here. Did you actually take time to look at stats before writing this garbage? You have no idea about what you're talking about. Curry shoots an impressive 66.9% from 0-3 feet this year--third best of his career. For comparison, LeBron shoots 73.3%--for his career... And that's on a much much higher volume. The ability to shoot better from more places doesn't matter if you can shoot from one place really really really good.  &gt;has one of the best handles in the league (if not, the best handles)  Lmao! Handles don't mean shit. You don't need to have a killer crossover if you're fucking LeBron James. You don't get points for having a cute offense.  &gt; doesn’t have the turnover problem than Lebron has,   That's why Bron's ast/to ratio is better? Is that why Curry averages a higher TO% for his career? If Curry had LeBron's usage he would average way more turnovers"
"Lebron James put his foot under him when shooting a jump shot injuring him, and essentially ending his career."
Hey the Lebron James ball game guy is calling the game I think he’s great
More like against LeBron James. LeBron probably still gets nightmares from 2014.
"Oh really, you mean like Sam Jones( 12 championships) He was known as a clutch scorer.  an elite scorer in Michael Jordan( 6 championships) Kobe Bryant... a shooter a scorer..with 5 championships. Most nba champions are scorers.. so its not just a few. lebron james.. steph curry.. Good try though.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Jones_(basketball)"
My absolute favorite thing about LeBron James is how he openly mocks the rest of the league for trying in the meaningless regular season and implies he barely tries and still wipes the floor with everyone.
"Well not just cavs fans, any team that has Lebron James has a chance to win and its tier 1, he has been there to many times, has won it all, proved a lot of people wrong and pulled one of the biggest comebacks in NBA history. He may not have the best chances, but never count out that man"
"ah yes i forgot that lebron james is a ""little more recognizable"" than swaggy"
"I hope you remember that we have James Johnson who’s the guy who managed to somewhat contain LeBron. A defensive minded young guy in Winslow who is just as capable of guarding Simmons.   We have a bunch of good role players who are capable of taking over games. Ellington, Johnson etc. We don’t need to rely on Wade. You also have to remember that without Embiid your rim protection is somewhat limited, I’m NOT saying it’s weak. Just without Embiid you have a huge advantage taken away. While we have Whiteside, who’s a very capable rim protector.     We have a great matchup, this series is going to be very entertaining. "
"Lol, calling the Spurs boring without our two way superstar? The fuck? Take Lebron out of Cleveland, you got a boring ass team. Take Giannis out of Milwaukee, you got a boring ass team. Take James Harden out of Houston, you got yourself a pretty boring ass team, even with just Chris Paul. Take Anthony Davis out of NO, you have a pretty boring ass team.   "

What about the team that has LeBron James? Aren't they favorites?   Sorry for the dumb question
"Absolutely, LeBron is amazing. But the Pacers are much better than a team he’s typically played in the first round, and after him and Kevin Love, there’s a sharp drop off.   If James tweaks his ankle, they’re probably done. But probably if Love has to miss a couple games, too. If Tristan Thompson plays heavy minutes, he’s a net negative to their chances.   The Cavs this year need a lot to go *right* in order to make the Finals, and the last three years they needed a lot to go *wrong* to miss them.    That’s what I’m saying. And the Pacers have (quietly) been a really good team all year. "
"That was, along James' 12-13 season, the funnest season I've ever seen from a player. Three aftee three, it just never stopped. I have a hard time deciding which was more fun to watch. Steph was like a cheat code but LeBron felt like he ""figured"" out basketball and showcased a perfect harmony between his BBIQ and his insane athleticism on both ends of the floor. "

"It's just interesting that their first names would make up two of their players, and their last names would make up the other two. Their first names make up Chris Paul and LeBron James, while their last names combine for Paul George and James Harden.  ...or are you being sarcastic because that comment is *really* hard to sense sarcasm."
Im not even a LeBron stan but how could you even compare Simmons and Bron?  Thats such an insult to James.  Simmons has a lot more to prove and isn't even as developed as Bron was at his age.

I am not some fun of Lebron( far away from that), but comparing Gianiss to Lebron hm, he will never be close to Lebron.

"This is something Wade has talked about in the past.  Lebron and Wade both had preliminarily agreed to sign with the Bulls, and a trade for Deng was in place.  However, both wanted to play with Bosh as well, and Miami was able to clear enough space to sign all three, and they went that direction instead.  They told the Bulls beforehand, who immediately then went for plan B, before Boozer became the number 1 FA on the market in the aftermath of the decision.  Wade and James wanted to play together in Chicago, they just wanted to play with Bosh more."
"Back when Harden was a 22 year old bench player. How does that matter?  People just love shouting “Lebron James” thinking it solves all issues but let me ask you this:  1. How do the Cavs defend the switches from Houston. How do you defend Harden as Kevin Love or Tristan Thompson. Houston has been abusing this strategy to great success.  2. How do you defend the number one offense in the league with the 29th defense in the league?  3. Who guards Chris Paul and James Harden? And for that matter, who guards Capela? Cavs have no inside presence and no way of stopping those guys from driving inside.  4. How does Cleveland produce enough offense to keep up? Houston has the 6th best defense in the league, with great wing defenders and great inside presence.  5. How does Cleveland match Houston’s deep bench? You cant really be expecting JR Smith and Cedi Osman to compete right?  6. Who takes over offensive duties outside Lebron? Previously they had Kyrie who could go for 30 a night and take on the responsibility. Now they dont have that. Lebron cant win a series by himself when he doesnt have a single other player who can create his own shot as evidenced in 2007, 2014 and 2015.  But yes please tell me how typing “Lebron James” solves all issues. "
"They had to beat LeBron James in a head-to-head matchup for the 3 seed. And LeBron had 44? pts in that game. Meanwhile, a lot of the Jazz success can be attributed to the incredible strength of their defense with Gobert. Obviously, Mitchell has been great and a rare rookie to be productive in an NBA offense. However, Ben Simmons has had a more profound impact on the Sixers' offense than Mitchell, has been a great defender all year and has done it since the beginning of the season. Mitchell unfortunately for him had to play catch-up, and Simmons finished so strong that it's hard to say that he's surpassed him."

For example, the TOR-CLE game on 3/21, a game where Lebron had 35 points 17 assists, and 0 turnovers. the starting lineup was Green, Love, James, Hill, Calderon. In this lineup in the first quarter, Calderon was the clear point guard. You can see him calling most of the plays and bringing the ball up. Then in the second quarter (with around 6 minutes left), the lineup is Hill - Clarkson- James - Green - Love/Holland. It looks like it started out with both Hill and James running point (they would change pretty much every possession), with Lebron taking over near the end of the half.   Beginning the 2nd half, same starting lineup. Calderon is running point. However, in transition, either a) a big like KLove usually give the ball to James, or if a guard/Jeff Green gets it, they'll run the rbeak. When it's Hill and James (non-transition plays), they continue to split duty.   Now 9:00 left in the 4th when Lebron comes back in. Neither Calderon or Hill are in and James is running point. When Hill comes in  Hill takes over Point Guard duties until the last minute of the game (it's a 1 point game) where Lebron takes over point and finishes the game.   So yeah, it's important to note that this is the first game without Ty Lue (when he had his health issues), so Drew was the coach. In conclusion, if Calderon is in, Calderon's running point. If Hill is in, it's a 50/50 tossup between James and Hill, and if it's transition, it's whoever gets the ball (if they're a guard) or James.   So I really don't know what to call him besides a point forward lol.  When he's in, he plays point guard around 50% of the time with the Cavs starting unit, and if Calderon is in, he's running it mostly during transition.   For Steph, I agree he has the skill to be an effective 2, but watching the game film, he's clearly the PG for this team. He brings the ball up, calls and initiates the play. Every once in a while, Draymond will do it.   Assists aren't really great at determining who's the PG and who's not.  Yes, it somewhat measures who's a ""good"" passer and point guards need to be good passers, but many times during plays multiple people will be getting the ball and the opportunity to assist, especially for set plays. Often times, you'll find teams will run a play to get the ball in the hands of a good passer who's not a PG and will run a few actions, hoping a man gets open and that the person with the ball sees them get open.

"WOW! LeBron James, it just hit me in the head!! He's a great player, ain't he?"

Only to be eclipsed by the first time in reddit history there is not a LeBron James playoff thread...  Of course that won’t be for another 12 years. 
"Your first point is correct, but I still don't see Lebron James missing an All NBA team for it. Maybe not first team, but he'd still be second most likely. "
Mate people give Lebron fucking James excuses when his all star team is playing like trash. Pretty sure Giannis gets a pass to. 
"Why, because he's simply LeBron James Jr?? He's going to be an instagod because he's LeBrons son?"
LeBron James
How am I misunderstanding the data? LeBron James with just under 4.5 points *per game*?
I feel like people who said that are either:  1) Incredibly biased and really disliked Kobe and/or LA fans. I remember a lot of super hardcore MJ fans being like this saying James was better even in 06 and stuff and even Wade (bruceblitz was a YT channel like that...only to shift to shit talking Lebron after he started winning). If your a homer then I guess it isn't too crazy but on this sub lots of non cavs/heat fans sometimes echo that statement.   2) Never watched ball during that time. No one would take you seriously if you said Kobe was never once the best player in the league.

It’s Lebron James!
LeBron James got Ira Newble to the finals man.
"Lebron James Harden has to be a 1 seed. Lebron will elite handles and slightly improved jumpshot.. God level. Basically a brolic, JJ Watt sized KD. Michael Jordan Bell would probably be second. A 6’11” Michael Jordan with a some rim protection and a motor on the boards? Jesus christ. Those 2 have to be 1 &amp; 2. Carmelo Anthony Davis is probably the 3 seed. AD with an improved scoring arsenal and mid range game. Or Melo with elite defense and length. Either way you look at it, basically a perfect PF built in a lab. "
"LeBron James after his ""back spasm treatments"".  Kobe after he went to Germany."
"It seems like you can say almost the EXACT same thing about Ben Simmons nowadays. Replace “LeBron James” with “Ben Simmons” and replace the old players with modern counterparts, and everything else is still pretty much spot on."
"But honestly if LeBron James tested positive for HGH, do you think it would be a good idea for the NBA to suspend him? They're a lot smarter than that"
I want to go on record saying LeBron James totally deserves to win MVP. It's just James Harden deserves to win MVP more. Both have been unreal this season but LeBron has been going on and off coasting while Harden has been on a mission.
&gt; ~~Lebron James~~ Lonzo Ball  FTFY
"""Well, Lebron was never going to LA, but I think he will be the best NBA player someday, not just a top player.  Of course, you can't really count a guy like Shaq or how good Yao Ming might be, but James will be the best perimeter player.  The only thing he really needs to work on, IMO, is his jumpshot.  He only shoots 40% and I saw some bad-looking shots out there. He's got the quickness, athleticism, and he's an incredible passer.  I see him being a 6'7"" guy who you really can use as a point guard, which will make him even more lethal.  Imagine if you could really use Kobe and T-Mac consistently at the point.  A team will have to decide if that would wear James down so much, but he could be like a Kobe with Magic's passing ability.""  This guy had some foresight."

"He's currently one of the most famous musicians in the world though. That's all there is to it. LeBron will probably have a longer lasting legacy, but right now drake is more famous. Justin Bieber is more well known than LeBron is too. Drake also has collaborations with top South American, Caribbean, African, and various European artists. So he's playing everywhere.   My club argument was more of an argument about him playing worldwide. You'll notice I also mentioned radio to bolster my argument. I don't really go in clubs anymore. I don't even really listen to the radio or pop music. I don't go to house parties. I'm in my late twenties and find most of my music from friends with similar taste and from forums online and shit. But popular music is popular music worldwide for the most part. You can argue all you want that people hear drake songs but don't know its drake, but that's a weak argument.  And really, I'm not saying he's exponentially more famous than LeBron James. I'm just saying he's very likely more globally famous, because that's just how that works. It is difficult to quantify, but I'm sure there are some marketing agencies that do it."
"[Friedell] LeBron James on if he takes the matchup with Lance Stephenson personally: “Who?” James replied. “Lance Stephenson,” a reporter said again. “I don’t know who the f*** that is,” James responded."
"Strength is definitely part of athleticism. Lebron James isn't regarded as the Goat athlete just because he can jump high but because he has a combination of size, strength,agility, and explosiveness. My point is that even if Frank doesn't gain a 40 inch vertical (even though Squats and deadlifts will most certainly give him a good amount of inches) he can gain strength and size with combined with his length will make him a plus athlete.

"I think that it's worth looking into, although the Most Improved award is probably the least flagrant since it's so subjective. At the very least, it's good for some lolz.  In the end, I think probably the guys left OFF the ballots are more damaging than the ones ON the ballots. If Tommy Heinsohn thinks Terry Rozier is the MVP then I don't think that's really going to affect the voting results in any way, but if a writer from Cleveland decides to put LeBron first in MVP voting and James Harden **fifth** then we have an issue."
"&gt;1st. LeBron James- 99 first team, 1 second team vote (Sherrod Blakely- CSN New England), 0 third team, left off 0 ballots &gt; &gt;1st. Russell Westbrook- 99 first, 1 second team vote (Flavio Tranquillo- Sky Italia), 0 third team, left off 0 ballots &gt; &gt;2nd. Stephen Curry- Voting breakdown: 1 first team vote (Flavio Tranquillo- Sky Italia)-93-6, left off 9 ballots  I don't think it's ridiculous to put Curry on the 1st team over Russell (and I thought Russ was the MVP). Curry's just one of the three-best players in the world. If that's how you pick All-NBA, then that's fine with me.  Alternatively, having Durant and Kawhi on the first team over LeBron isn't that ridiculous if you view team success as more important than being the best player in the world. I disagree, but it's ok if you're consistent.  I'm also ok with someone saying Anthony Davis isn't a center since he splits his time pretty evenly.  The issue is that the criteria are left up to the media person. If the NBA defined these terms, you might end up with better results."
"Year  |  ROY  |  Notable Players | Conclusion -------|-------|-------------------|-------------- 2000  |  Mike Miller  |  Kenyon Martin, Jamal Crawford, Michael Redd | Conclusion: No, not even worth arguing 2001  |  Pau Gasol  |  Joe Johnson, Tony Parker, Gilbert Arenas  |  Yes, but this one is very close, and this is just my personal opinion. Gasol is just over parker for me. He has had such a long peak and still today a formidable starter 2002 | Amar’e Stoudemire | Yao Ming, Carlos Boozer | No, this is another close one. But I believe Yao Ming edges this one out. Even though Yaos career was short, but in the time he played he dominated the game 2003 | Lebron James | Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh | Do i really have to say it? 2004 | Emeka Okafor | Dwight Howard, Loul Deng, Andre Iguodala | No, Not even close 2005 | Chris Paul | Andrew Bynum, Deron Williams, Andrew Bogut | Yes, Deron williams would have been the only one close, but his career seemingly fell off a cliff. 2006 | Brandon Roy | LaMarcus Aldridge, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Paul Millsap | No, however if injuries didn’t derail his career he may have been. But there is just to much talent in this class to say he undoubtedly would have been the best 2007 |  Kevin Durant | Al Horford, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley |  Yes, one of the best scorers of all time. Move along 2008 | Derrick Rose | Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, DeAndre Jordan | No, another story of what could have been but injuries took that away from us. Rose is my favorite player, but to say that Westbrook has not had a better career so far would be false. 2009 | Tyreke Evens | Blake Griffin, James Harden, Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Jrue Holiday | No, but looking back was that an unbelievably stacked class of guards. And Tyreke Evens had the best rookie year. Makes you think. 2010 | Blake Griffin | John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Paul George | No, but This one is hard to judge because Blake Griffin was not actually drafted in this class, but all 3 of these guys are better then Blake Griffin 2011 | Kyrie Irving | Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard | No, aside from all the Kawhi drama this year, he is a Top 10 player in the league, and a defensive monster. No question on this one. 2012 | Damian Lillard | Anthony Davis, Bradly Beal, Draymond Green | No, Anthony Davis is a beast on both ends of the floor and in conversations for DPOY and MVP 2013 | Michael Carter Williams | Rudy Gobert, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Viktor Oladipo | Yeah No, just refer back to these three names 2014 | Andrew Wiggins | Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Aaron Gordon | No, Embiid is on another level above everyone else"
"Don't be bitter. It would be so much easier for him to score and put up offensive numbers in a faster paced, more open offense with Lebron James passing to him and taking much of the defensive attention.  He'd also be hitting his prime while Lebron began to decline, allowing him to look more like an equal than any of Lebron's former costars.    Not to mention the fact that he'd constantly be playing on national tv in the biggest spotlight, make it deep into the finals every year and have a great shot at winning a championship every season.

"This is grade inflation. If you call more than like 1 or 2 guys superstars, then you need a new superlative for the 1 or 2 guys who are actually bigger than the sport.  **Lebron James is a superstar.**  That's the list. Steph Curry and KD are the closest thing there is to an honorable mention.  Basketball fans know who those other guys are, and know that they are great. *Everybody* knows who Lebron James is, both by name and by face."
"I wonder what Skip is going to do when LeBron retires. ""Michael Jordan retired not once but twice - 100% more than LeBron James ever dreamed of retiring - and after one of his retirements he was shitty at baseball. LeBron has never been shitty at baseball. We all know who the all time greatest is and it isn't ""King"" James."""
It depends on what your team has. Ex... If you have a LeBron James or Ben Simmons you don't need playmaking as much. A sharp shooting guard might actually be more beneficial to your team. 
He utilized all of his hate for LeBron James and saved his kindness for everything else.  He's probably a very pleasant person to be around unless you bring up LeBron...

I kind of get what you're saying but Kawhi was Finals MVP and flat out outplayed Lebron in that Series. Lebron had his Lebron Numbers but if you watched the games you could tell that Kawhi was _easily_ superior and I'm a huge James Stan in general. I'm not saying Kawi is the best player in the world but he adds value to teams that Kyrie simply couldn't replicate. If you had similar rosters Kawhis impact would be bigger.
"So Rondos now been a part of 4 road playoff wins in a row as the lower seed... playoff Rondo in full effect.   My only explanation is that the NBA (and all levels of basketball really), has become so fast-break oriented, that sometimes half-court offensive becomes an afterthought. In the playoffs teams are forced into more half-court, which they may have split practice with between running breaks, and are subject to going cold if consistently forced into half-court setting.  Rondo excels at the half-court. He knows how to run real offense and keep pressure on the opposing team by scoring (they can't run breaks when you make buckets.) He just knows how to trick teams on D, which amplifies in the playoffs since people react harder. He'll make D's exert twice as much energy per possession as his O, which will eventually wear them out, and create a big run.   This is at the point where POR better hope to wake up tomorrow to breaking news of Rondo injuring his wrist again, because otherwise, they gone like LeBron 'Kawhi Leonard' James.  Edit - Also, there's the whole AD being a top 3 player in the league thing. He's one of those super elite dudes, where his worst game all season is probably still better than a lot of players best game. Shot falling or not, he always has a positive impact.   2nd edit - I should add that I didn't watch the game and am just going by box. But WTH is with Portland's free-throw numbers? Like damn, you playing 0-1 at home as the 3 seed and only get 10 free-throws... Your 2 stars get 4 total? Like, I'm sure they didn't drive a lot, Celts had a lot of similar games last year, but jeez, Refs don't seem to have played any favorites, which is rare given their situation. Especially since they were losing for a good chunk of the game. Again, just going by box score, but I can't imagine Portland's too happy with the refs (nor any losing team really), however, this sheet does standout, so they probably have some merit. "

Lebron James.  
That's a really specific criteria.  There are stories out there that point to him having a massive ego :  https://deadspin.com/5867328/lebron-james-wouldnt-let-walter-iooss-jr-who-was-photographing-him-for-nike-speak-directly-to-him  And that's not a bad thing. I don't think it's possible to play at the level LeBron has without a huge ego.
"&gt;Warriors would have won in 2015 anyways ..  Curry lost twice to MOZGOV AND TRISTAN THOMPSON, and couldn't even get FMVP.  lol.  &gt;Curry will win another championship this year  KD will win a championship, while Curry sits out of most of the playoffs because his glass body can't handle the game.  &gt;Steph Curry= LeBron James kryptonite  Tell that to the 2015 finals.

"Karl Malone was a freak of nature. Probably the closest thing to Lebron, physically, we’ve seen in the league. He just didn’t have anywhere near the ball skills James does. He was also known for how he took care of his body. It’s why, like Lebron, he almost never missed a game due to injury.   People mostly only remember old guy Malone now. But he was insanely athletic. Bulking up and getting stronger as he got older is part of how he kept scoring- he compensated for losing a step by being able to bully power forwards and centers off his spot and making that fadeaway.   Karl was actually *much* better at not missing games due to injury. In his entire career, he played fewer than 80 games *twice* (18 year career) This year is only the third time James has done it. Despite all that, he had to completely change his game to continue scoring at that level.   That’s not to say Lebron can’t do it. But 34-35 is near the point where every great started declining (except Karl... kinda. Kareem actually did start a slow decline at 34 too). Father Time is undefeated. The chances of him scoring 25ppg the next two years are not great. And it will only get consistently harder after that. "
They're probably referring to 2014  Lebron James 22.8/6.3/5.3  Paul George       24/5.3/4    
"Put him on the high post and run splits with lots of movement and cutting. Similar to how the Warriors use Draymond/D. West. He's a rhythm guy too and the more touches he gets, the better. Don't use him as a Center either, his rim protection sucks and he's much better as a 4 with a center that can play defense.  He's not as good posting up now because he has shed weight in order to run the fast pace offense that Lebron likes to run. Look back in his Minny days, he was more...fat. He's still good though, enough to keep defenses honest.  However, it'll never happen as long as he's playing with Lebron. The Cavs are going to run what Lebron wants and that's it. You can't say much either because it's Lebron James and it's worked so you just have to shrug. Kevin Love had to adjust like Bosh and here we are. "
"Lebron will be 38 in 5 years. Dirk also started in the nba 2 years older than Bron, and had fewer finals runs, and honestly just doesn’t play with the same insane athletic ferocity.   Now I know better than to assume James *can’t* do something, but Father Time is undefeated. I think he’s going to become more and more of a facilitator as the years go by. I think if he does it he will do it when he’s 40. "

Dude's career is almost over and he still hasn't played in the conference finals. Keep going. "
"Drake is more known, people are only saying Lebron James is more popular because this is /r/nba. [Here](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=Drake,Lebron) is a comparison using Google trends. [Remember] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGzmyn2eSBY) this video when Lebron rode the NYC Subway and a lot of the passengers didn't even recognize who Lebron was. Drake is more known in the sense that people know or heard of his music. God's Plan charted #1 for 12 weeks and the song to overtake it? His new single Nice For What. Not everyone is into sports. But music is everywhere. Turn on the radio? God's Plan is playing. Go to a club or a party? God's Plan is playing. Ask any college girl who Drake is. They'll know. Ask them who Lebron is? They might know."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting BS about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Haha so you admit that you’re a Cavs fan... gotcha. I’m not even a Warriors fan, I roll with the Celtics .. but yes I’m a Curry fan and did want the Warriors to win in 2016.. as soon as Draymond got suspended , I predicted that the Cavs would win the championship. How can you throw a lifeline to a player like Lebron and suspend a star player for a home close out game in the FINALS, that for something that Draymond didn’t even instigate. Pathetic move by the Nba and a huge momentum shift. Not to mention the lopsided refereeing in games 5 and 6.. the fix was in, the Crooked NbA did everything in its power to ensure a game 7.. but I admit that Game 7 was referees fair and Cavs won it fair and square BUT it should not have gone to game 7 in the first place. Game 5 should have been played on an even playing field.   Still , the rise of Curry is sole reason for Lebron James not dethroning Michael Jordan... you can bring up management and coaching all you want , but this is a players league, and Curry , the two time MVP , is the man who brought Golden State out of the gutter and into historical greatness.  A 6’3 skinny unathletic  guard from Davidson is in the way of Lebrons GOAT status. How sad... enjoy your asterisk championship.   And how is Curry living in KDs shadow when Curry's still selling more shoes and jerseys than KD and the GSW fans are still chanting MvP for Curry, not once for Kd. Last time I checked , the system still runs through the Splash bros not Kd. No okc version of Kd allowed in Golden State. And did Kareem live in Magic’s shadow or vice versa? Has either of their legacy been hurt just because they’ve played with one another? Hell no. They are still both considered top 5 players even though they played with one another. As long as Kd and Curry win 3-4 more championships together, they will both get their shine  and be remembered as an even greater duo than Magic and Kareem. But I’m hoping that the Celtics get Anthony Davis and Kawhi so the Celtics can win it instead hahah. As for you and all Cavs and lebron fans, enjoy your one asterisk championship. You will have to wait another 50 years , while Curry will be winning plenty more. So sad."
"LeBron isn't coming, but you seem like a nice guy and I want to help you out. James Jones is the VP in Phoenix too"
"What John Wall got on offense, he gave up on defense. Early in the game he kept playing full court on Lowry and would try and gamble for a steal in transition. Also in the half court he got lost in the pick and rolls and switches. Also there were a few Lowry and Derozan pick and rolls where he just gave up. He was Washington's best player tonight but you can't win anything without defence. I'd also like to see him run back on defence instead of complaining for a foul everyplay. The way Wall drives attracts contact but it doesn't mean its a foul. If everytime someone was touched on a drive and was called for a foul then it would be an undefendable play (The Lebron James).  Also, I wonder if players, not just Wall, know that the game doesn't stop when you're complaining to a ref. While you're telling the ref off, your team is trying to defend a 5v4 in transition where you could be costing your team another 2-3 points."
That’s such a stupid argument. The 2 stars that non-NBA fans really seem to know are Steph Curry and Lebron James.
"There's also tons of people who don't watch basketball and know who LeBron James is. By the same token, there's also tons of people who don't listen to pop music."
They still know who LeBron James is
Jaylen Brown has a Lebron James demeanor. He kinda looks a bit like him too
The AFC won only two superbowls in the 1980s and it was the same team. The NFC in the NFL and the Western Conference in the NBA are similar since the postseason in those conferences are bloodbaths now while the AFC and the Eastern Conference used to be the Tom Brady and LeBron James Playoff Invitational  
"It's worth noting that he's averaged **75** games per season and **26** PPG in his latest stint in Cleveland (let's call it post-peak LeBron), and based on 538's [CARMELO projection](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/carmelo/lebron-james/), he's most comparable to all-time legends with at least 5 productive years left in the tank. So that looks good for him.   However, most of those comparable players were power forwards or centers who were able to defer to younger guards or other stars as they got older. Also, few of them had already tallied close to 15 years and 53,000 minutes played. So if this is going to happen, LeBron's going to need teammates to share the burden, and perhaps an assist from small-ball by playing more as a 4.   **TLDR:** I for one can't wait to see him keep blowing our minds, along with the look on people's faces when they'll be pressed to concede that MJ (RINGS ERNEHH) or Kareem (POINTS ERNEHHH) might not be the GOAT."
Now this is an idea I could get behind. Until Lebron James comes barreling into my face. 
"Jaylen ""LeBron ""Michael ""Kobe ""Larry ""Magic Johnson"" Bird"" Bryant"" Jordan"" James"" Brown"
"Okay, I'm not getting into pace and space and teammate arguments. It's fruitless.   But I do have a real talk question. Do you really believe that LeBron wants to play more and better defense, but just can't? Like his team and the modern NBA have foiled his dream of being an elite defender? You really believe that?  Also, why would voter fatigue or greatness fatigue or whatever you call it only affect LeBron??? Kobe and Jordan and Duncan all get votes for everything based on reputation, but LeBron actually gets ignored because he's just so much greater than they were? What the fuck kinda sense does that make? This phenomenon only has ever affected LeBron James?"
"I'm convinced that Al Horford is better than Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, James Harden, and LeBron James combined. You can't change my mind. I'm dug in."
Oh man I just love you Spurs so much. Take one LeBron James as my gift.

"I think that by most metrics, LeBron James is a top 5 player of all time. However, the fact that he is 3-5 in NBA Finals is looked at negatively by some fans. Additionally, the fact that he had to leave Cleveland and join Wade/Bosh/Allen etc. in Miami in order to win his first championship is something that NBA purists hate. Loyalty is overvalued by most fans imo. "

"I agree -- you have a lot of young talent and the future looks bright. You should be optimistic (shit I still am even though the Spurs are about to get taken to the woodshed in four games and potentially lose their future franchise player). Portland is definitely one piece away, but that's a pretty big piece considering the landscape of today's NBA.   All I'm really trying to say is that LeBron James changed everything. His decision was the starting point of what's happening now in the NBA. Players will go where they want to go. They understand their power and dictate their careers. We saw it with LeBron, KD, PG (to an extent), Hayward, and now Kawhi (plz no -- still in denial). It's a new league. "

"&gt;I used to say inside the FBI, this is a great organization, but it’s not good enough. It can never be good enough. We have to find parts of our game to make better. Look at LeBron James. # &gt;He illustrates what the endless pursuit of excellence looks like.   If the Bible was rewritten today, LeBron would be Jesus."
"Every player in the playoffs has a chance to make a legacy.  There's more pressure on the stars who have never won a championship, but there's plenty of pressure on LeBron James, who is trying to catch Jordan, or Dwyane Wade, who wants to show he has something left.  There's also pressure on rookies like Simmons, Mitchell, and Tatum, who want to finish off great rookie years by showing they won't wilt in the playoffs.  One of the greatest parts of Magic Johnson's legacy, after all, was winning Finals MVP as a rookie.  There's even pressure on role players who want to be the next Robert Horry."
"No, absolutely not. Lebron is not just a 33 year old in his 16th season with an acl/mcl injury. Hes lebron motherfucking james. Hell, even if you completely removed his ability to drive, hes still worth more than a first rounder. He is an elite playmaker and floor general, who can shoot the spot up 3"
Nah /r/nba is more like  Born too early to witness 9/11  Born too late to explore the world.  Born just in time for LeBron James.

"I’m 41 years old. I watched Michael his entire NBA career. I’ve watched LeBron his entire NBA career. The first 10 years of LeBron’s career, I would have guessed he ended up top 5 all time. But the last few years, he has been simply remarkable.   Michael could not do what LeBron can do.   LeBron James is the best overall basketball player of all time in my humble opinion.   And for the record, Magic is my all time favorite. "

"&gt; If they somehow make it to the finals again, they'll get slammed. They're so much worse than last year. How is that fun for anyone to watch?  This is so significant, man. LeBron is a living legend and he deserves so much glory but FUCK do I not want the Cavs in the finals. There's just no way they win. Their team is objectively mediocre + LeBron James. That just isn't enough anymore."
"There was an 8 second shot clock differential. If I'm the Pacers I'd much rather be down three with the ball and eight seconds (worst case, best case game tied and the Pacers have the ball with eight seconds and a timeout) than tied and the Cavaliers having the ball with three seconds. I don't ever want the game to be in the hands of Lebron James, he's too good."
"The previous play that was called out of bounds off James was knocked out of bounds by Pacers. Should have been Cavs ball but they didn’t review.  I’ve tried to find a replay of the block / goaltend and can’t find one that actually shows a good angle of it to say one way or another anyway. Also, if it’s such an obvious goaltend, all the Pacers would have been shouting for the bucket to count.  Unfortunately, there will always be salt when LeBron is involved."
"It’s not really that confusing. His second playoff series ever, he’s going up directly against Lebron James, and he’s the first and second option of his team. The opposing team as a whole is focused on stopping him above all else and in the 1-on-1 matchup he’s wildly outmatched. It takes time to learn how to handle that situation. "
You forget that for his first couple years Michael Jordan didnt play with the greatest supporting cast of all time and carried them to the playoffs much in the same vein as Lebron James. Everyone needs help to win its a team game.
LEBRON JAMES...  WITH NO REGARD FOR THE HUMAN PERCEPTION OF TIME
"No loss has ever hurt more than this one. He’s probably going to cruise to the finals now and no one will ever remember how close we were. 5 years, 5 long years we’ve played Lebron better than anyone else in the east with nothing to show for it.  No one ever talks about the Pacers. No one ever takes us seriously. But you ask Lebron who has given him the hardest time this decade, I’m sure he’d say us.  Every time I start to come to grips with the fact that we’ll never beat him, the Pacers pull me right back in and give me a glimmer of hope. Combine that with some questionable officiating and your star player playing like hot garbage (yet still almost pulling it out every time), and you have major heartbreak.  This is why I laugh at people that suggest he might ever come here (edit: of fucking course he’s not coming, I know that) in free agency. I don’t want him here. We’ve done nothing but try and beat him for so long, it’s all our fans really know anymore.  This just isn’t fun. He’s too good. Fuck being in the east and fuck Lebron.  And I like mean that as a compliment.  I’m sick and fucking tired of losing to Lebron James."

No guard in the NBA is going to drive James on the last possession in a playoff game. That’s fine, find a better shot for your team."

"Like I said, this wasn’t a one off example. Google it. This is a common occurrence for a lot of women’s pro teams.  But I’m less interested in the specific final scores and more interested in the fact that 14 year old boys can compete on the same field in the first place.  For these games to come down to things like coaching, strategy or motivation like you mentioned, the skill level of the players *has* to be relatively even. The worst coached, least motivated NBA team would beat any high school team by 200 points. Those factors only matter between evenly matched teams  For you to imply that maybe these random high school teams consistently win because they have better coaching or strategy than the coach of the #1 women’s teams in the world is pretty stupid to say. And if the problem is motivation for the women, that doesn’t help your case either. If somebody needs to be motivated in order to win a game, that means their your opponent is at least relatively the same skill level. For example, LeBron James could goof around and beat any high schooler 21-0 because the talent difference is so huge it doesn’t matter if LeBron is motivated or not "
"Fit is overrated, he didn't say it was nothing. Melo isn't good and Russ is very hard to play with. The Cavs I'm not sure. They've got two stars, but a very flawed roster. What is there to talk about fit?  The Sixers with Lebron is an odd fit. Two guys who really need the ball, but one cannot even consider shooting. A center who can shoot in theory, but isn't good enough at it. Spacing could get cramped, but it's Lebron James and they would make it work to some degree.   I don't buy into the Simmons stagnating stuff. Opportunity is important, but getting better is about more than that. It's about working on stuff, his shooting, his post gane, etc. A lot of that happens outside the real games.   "

The Cavs have NEVER been this good and the ONE GOAT level talent that comes along and comes back to your franchise JUST TO FULFILL HIS PROMISE and you say you're not a fan of him?

"I didn't take it personally, I'm not Lebron James fyi"
"I've watched both their careers, all of LeBrons and Kobes since 98. Bryant mastered the game in more ways than LeBron imo. From his footwork to having literally a counter move for anything, he had a more diverse skill set as far as attacking a specific defensive scheme from all three levels. James was a great help defender but I'll take Kobe man to man, and played in a more complicated offensive system throughout his career. A lot people say winning and championships are team accomplishments, which is true but statistics also depend on the structure of the team around you. He played tougher competition and won more. I'll take Kobe at the end of games. The evidence is in the tape. James is going to shatter every numbers record but they don't tell the whole story. I think stats are great, and am in no means bashing analytics, but numbers deserve proper context. Like the type of offense LeBron consistently runs, or the spacing, and pace of the game recently, all play a part in numbers, or ""evidence"". It's almost like Manning(LeBron) vs Brady(Kobe) in football."

Lebron got him that contract. [Source](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/10/4/9448295/lebron-james-tristan-thompson-contract-cavaliers-holdout)  Kyrie is a casualty of the Lebron effect. LBJ can't help it but that's the way it goes. When you are that big of a media draw it's going to affect some individuals who are tired of being considered second fiddle.   Lebron controls that team. If you don't think so YOU are delusional. He's got the entire team wrapped around his finger. You really think that Koby made all the moves and then told LeBron and that LBJ had no clue?   Every team consults with their stars before they make a big move. Thinking that this team doesn't is ridiculous. Taking it a step further to think that LBJ helps make those decisions is a logical step considering what he did with both TT and Blatt. They don't make a move without asking LBJ.   Who controls what the players wear? Oh yeah that was just out of the goodness of LBJ... not that he wanted to try to make a statement about unity and team... nope.
"Jordan could pass and rebound too but for the team to be most successful they needed Jordan to put the team on his back offensively.   Game 1 Lebron scored 24 points, 7 buckets made. How can Lebron James make only 7 buckets in 44 minutes at home in the playoffs? Game 2 was exactly what they need from Lebron.  Cavs coaching is terrible and they aren't getting the most out of guys. That said Lebron needs to be scoring 40 a game with how his team is playing offensively."
Aka best player in the court so far this playoffs  Edit: well not named LeBron James
"The warriors also went 16-1 in the post season with KD in the team. you can't tell me KD didn't contribute to it.  As I said, Wade may be leaving his prime, but Wade James Bosh Allen at the time was still far more talent stacked to one team than any other team at the time. It was a conscious move to stack the deck heavily. There's no going around it. No matter how you phrase it, Lebron WANTED a superteam to crush all others.  KD and Lebron's decision came down to a matter of degree, not kind"
"His team doesn’t suck. They just lack any chemistry. If you have a team that once consisted of Isiah Thomas, Kevin Love, Dwayne Wade, Derrick Rose, Lebron James, Kyle Koehler, etc. and you are struggling at any point in the regular season or playoffs, it’s a coaching issue."
We've seen what LeBron James is capable of when he's tired and carrying a pathetic team. The man is extremely hard to beat; that can't be dismissed.
"I honestly doubt it 4 out of 7 at this point man. Just think about it logically, after giving no effort on the defensive end all season they've had a top 5 offensive rating. Now that it's playoff time they are giving full effort on D and all of a sudden what? You can't tell me the offensive lack is do to just ""missing open shots"" for 3 games straight. Indiana is not exactly a defensive prowess. Bojan Boganovic played tremendous D on Lebron fuckkng James last night. He's too tired to upkeep both ends of the floor with this poorly managed squad. Also I don't know how you could say definitely with such confidence, Indiana is nowhere near the talent set Toronto and 76ers have, there just outplaying them because they're the better cohesive TEAM and are showing better effort. Something that is even higher in quality with the raps and 76ers. "
When you see D-Wade balling and you're stuck with Jordan Clarkson[](http://cdn1-www.mandatory.com/assets/uploads/2015/03/sad-lebron-james-2-e1425339915613.jpg)

D Wade in LeBron James mode
They were all pulling a Lebron James.
James Johnson been to the Lebron school of defense. He'd rather stand there complaining than hustling back.
He just broke a playoff record previously held by Dwyane Wade and LeBron James.
"They hit 18 threes twice the entire season, and twice against the Heat in 3 games. Its as unlikely as DWade dropping 27 every game. Nobodys arguing they're scrubs, but the fact is that nobody coming out of the east is going to win more than one game in the finals   &gt;More so, this belief that the 76ers are just gunna get run down by anyone who comes out the West is just goofy.  And why the hell is that? Last year the Cavs lost ONE game in the entire playoffs until facing the Warriors, and they barely got a win. Thats with LeBron fucking James averaging a triple double. If you believe the sixers facing either the Cavs or the rockets wouldn't be steamrolled in a similar fashion youre delusional"
He is a homeless lebron james
LeBron James
"Look at the guy right next to James, Hood, who runs down the court.  Great effort by Hood, however he doesn't do anything to affect the shot.  LeBron saw the Cavs were outnumbered and that the pacers were going to get a great shot no matter what on that fast break.  If by some miracle the Cavs got the possession back, he was in a great position to score."
"They did force LeBron to wear a clear mask: http://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/10535429/nba-asks-lebron-james-miami-heat-wear-clear-mask-protect-broken-nose  &gt;James appealed the decision and is still trying to get clearance to wear the black mask because he likes the lightness and fit of it, a source said. He also said he liked the style and how it matched the Heat's black throwback uniforms. It gave him no issues when he put up 31 points on 13-of-19 shooting in the Heat's 108-82 win against the Knicks."
Lmao he wanted Spo fired so Riley could coach. Exactly the opposite of what you’re saying. [sauce](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23088267/pat-riley-said-lebron-james-did-right-thing-left-miami-nba)
It's like people don't understand that running your best play over and over isn't as good as just having several things to do.  Of course Lebron James is your best scoring option.  Of course it gets predictable after a minute if you only run Lebron drive and kicks.
Yeah cause running K Love post ups is way better than playing through LeBron fucking James lol
"Kawhi Leonard (3&amp;D). Anthony Davis(rim protector). James Harden, Lebron James (playmaker)"
"A lot of the points you raise make a lot of sense. I'm not here to claim that kyrie didn't know how to play point properly last year, and I think your point about the results of his p&amp;r sets describes my point perfectly. Kyrie was used as a scorer. His ability to get points was his main contribution to the team, and LeBron ran the offense way more than he did. He may have improved his point guard skills slightly, but they were always there, just underutilized.  Kyrie set the pace for us way more than Smart ever did. When healthy, kyrie was the only guard on the floor most possessions and he brought the ball up and ran the deadly p&amp;r with Al and often found Al or open guys coming off other screens. When he shared the floor with smart, he moved to SG and focused on getting open for points. When he played with rozier, Terry was the SG, and kyrie ran the offense. Rozier  isn't really a point guard, he just plays there for us because of all the injuries.  When I use the term marginalized, I'm referring to the teams lack of  focus on using his playmaking ability, instead relying on James and making kyrie focus on scoring. Of course the ""system"" was designed around Lebrons ability rather than the ability of your average point guard. So I think you have a point about the part that the coaches played. However it's fair to point out that LeBron has played like that all his life and the only coach that really set up a system that allowed other players to shine was spo, who he reportedly clashed with leading up to his exit (and to an extent even the heat didn't run as many motion sets when LeBron was around) and to a smaller extent Blatt whose ignorance of NBA rules, and reported bad player (read: LeBron) relationships killed him (although Lue too has had his fair share of timeout blunders)   Ultimately I think we're saying the same thing, but I probably worded my previous comments poorly. Where we differ is at whether it's the fault of the coach or LeBrons domineering personality and influence."
LeBron and Kyrie’s masks were also carbon fibre though http://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/10535429/nba-asks-lebron-james-miami-heat-wear-clear-mask-protect-broken-nose   Hopefully the NBA just realized that black masks are sick 
"""LeBron James is STILL the greatest player in basketball and this is why...""  10 bucks homie"
Did you just use regular season numbers to show why a team with Lebron fucking James is the most likely to lose in the first round 
"You could also do :  Chris, Paul, LeBron, James"
"Am I? Lebron james being a locker room cancer is not a meme, it's a statement. Calling me skip Bayless when I am not, is a meme. Feel free to look at the definition before you come at me with your rubbish. I provided evidence and I'm waiting for it to be refuted, so far I've combatted his points and he moved to ad-hominem attacks, ceding the point imho."
"LeBron James trashing on his own teammates:  ""Guys just gotta play better... no matter who it is."""
"It might be boring, but dammit, that's a leader.  While watching this it dawned on me that LeBron James is an infinitely better leader than the President of the United States right now."
Our core hasn't even come close to reaching their potential this is their first season playing together!! You know NOTHING about the process which is to have the longest view in the room. You want to blow up our core and our chemistry for a 35 year old LeBron James who takes away from what Ben Simmons does best.   Stay in Cleveland. 
Bro the other team has LeBron James that is enough for me to say they do not have the best amongst others. Regular season doesn’t matter in the playoffs. You’re starting 0-0. Good luck to the pacers tho. I hope they take LJ down
"Hypothetical: say the Rockets get LeBron and Paul George next season.  You could say 4 of the starters names by saying 2 full names.  Paul, George, James, Harden. 🤔"
Lebron James scored....Oh Okay!?
"Yes, extremely overrated. His peak is Kevin Martin, no more   Edit: Seems you get downvoted here for talking negative on anyone other than LeBron James or James Harden, shame "
A few weeks ago I could have pictured Lebron James choosing to stay in Cleveland... not much anymore. 
"Spot on. Most of his media coverage has been LeBron centric and not very objective. The LBJ coalition has been very annoying, which sucks because as a Kobe fan, I actually like James but the constant moving of the goal post to fit his narrative has been ridiculous."
"I was almost with you until you said  ""...one of the greatest 2 players to ever play the game."" Top 5 is more reasonable but top 2 is pushing it. Also, it's less the fans and more so the media pushing pro narratives without any objectivity, that I'm against. The LeBron James coalition."
"&gt; Who from the starting line up would be replace? The bench is the only logical option  GTFO with that.  You make room for Lebron James, he starts over Draymond  or you at least move Dray to the 5.  You start the second best basketball player of all time over almost anyone."
"Exactly, JVG saying ""would that have been a call if it was the other way around with James at ball?"" was fucking stupid because we all know LeBron doesn't get those calls ever."
"It was hard to watch, Im a Cavs fan and a big time LeBron fan if the Cavs get knocked out in the first round I won't blame James one bit for leaving. Because that will be a clear indication that they are years away from being a legit contender for the title, much less be able to make it to the finals you know. I hope LeBron joins a team that doesn't make me grind my teeth every game lol."
"Wade was good that first year in Miami but was injured and not the same player after that. And KD to GSW was very different from Lebron to Miami. Look at their record in 2010 and compare it to the Warriors that KD joined. Not comparable at all. KD joined a 73 win team that won a title, was a millimeter from repeating (if not for the greatest finals performance ever from James), and had 3 of the leagues top 15 players. KDs legacy as a player is forever tarnished by his episode chitchats move."
"Your proposal would ensure longer periods of bad basketball for a lot of teams.  Memphis can and probably will try and offer max contracts to Paul George, LeBron James, try and convince kawhi to sign longer-term before they try and trade for him... And they will get none of them.  They didn't try to tank on paper they held onto gasol and Evans and didn't dump them, but if the lottery ball doesn't fall their way they could be picking 10th.  Another year of losing, then the ball maybe lands at 7.  Then 9.  Then 6.  They still can't sign free agents, the talent they have access to is limited.  If all it took was losing to win long term then teams like the Lakers should be in par with Philly now.  Their record wasn't much better over past 4 years and had roughly the same picks as the 76erz, they just made terrible decisions with free agents and had to literally trade away first round picks to dump salary.  Now they are hoping to get bailed out by signing free agents which is a luxary 90% of the league doesn't have."
LeBron “Gladly take every shot in the game except the last” James
"Yes, he has a high basketball I.Q. and uses it well on the defensive end but there are times when they let him play. Not just defensively, on offense as well. Like with most superstars, when LeBron is in a 50-50 situation when there's contact, whether he initiated it or not, he usually gets the benefit of the doubt. Block-Charge calls, times when he extends his forearm when driving and when he's playing physical defense with contact, they let him play. I would agree that Harden gets more favoritism when he drives, but overall James get favoritism as well."
"I mean what does he get for contesting that? Lebron James will dunk it either way, might as well not get embarrassed for no reason."
"This is insanity.   LeBron has no help *because of the contracts his camp pushed for*.  Under normal circumstances, the Tristan Thompson and JR Smith contracts do not play out the way they did. TT's contract was a TERRIBLE DECISION by management the day he signed it. JR Smith was acquiesced to on his contract demands because LeBron dangled the 'I'm Leaving Unless...' act.   On any team not being held hostage by LeBron JR and TT either take smaller deals on the Cav, or walk and get replaced with cheaper players that may or may not work out. The team might not be as good as it is now (or it might be better) BUT the contracts are a lot easier to swallow.   It's a fucking miracle that the Cavs were able to swing IT and Shump for what they did, but there are **NO TEAMS** interested in Tristan Thompson and JR Smith without that Nets pick. So a good chunk of their salary each year is sucked up, in addition to the bits that are taken by LeBron and Love (obviously those are positive assets).   Is the team around LeBron a bad one? Yes. Does management deserve some of the blame for that? Yes, but not as much as this sub seems to think. Is LeBron James just the blameless victim of horrible leadership at the Cavs? Absolutely not. "
"Fair, a lot of their foul trouble came from being in the post constantly. My point is not that LeBron should foul out like they did, but they make up for his lack of fouls on the offensive end by letting him be more physical than others on the defensive end. He's rarely in foul trouble. So yes, he deserves more calls but they give him leeway in other scenarios. We've seen wing players going against LeBron in more foul trouble even though James is more physical. Oladipo in game 2 for example, and Curry in game 6 in 2016 as another. He doesn't go to the line like Harden but they let him play so it balances itself out imo"
"Yea no player is above constructive criticism. There's a lot of downvotes with anything not praising LeBron. I'm a Grizzlies fan, but Kobe was my favorite player growing up so I've gotten my fair share of downvotes. I wear em as a badge of honor. I enjoy different perspectives and civil discussions! To use Kobe as an example, he had his faults as does any player, but I enjoyed him going against his nature and letting other players eat early, then attacking when the opportunity presented itself. Young Kobe, although reluctantly at times, had to learn under Phil how to pick his spots and simultaneously get Shaq involved. He would go off script and empty the chamber with shots galore if he felt the game slipping instead of sticking to the plan. As he matured, he saw if he wanted to fully utilize his skill set, he had to let others eat to keep his teammates in the rhythm, him fresh for potential late game heroics, and the defense honest. Like I said, even til the end of his career he struggled to find that perfect balance but seemed to find the right play when needed most.  I see your Spurs flair, and I've watched many of Spurs games with yall being in my division and being a constant threat in the West during the Kobe years. We can get into Kobe/TD on another day, but an undervalued part of Duncan's game was to seamlessly blend his game with other dominant players. Robinson early, Ginobili with the flowing locs back in 05, Parker as Finals MVP in 07, and through the Kawhi era. He was truly able to make his teammates better by blending his game to his teammates strengths. Something he did effortlessly, Kobe did reluctantly, and LeBron rarely does imo. Shaq left Kobe early even though that had more to do with money. Kyrie left LeBron while James was the mature vet. He can make it work if he goes to another team, but he'll have to sacrifice more than he has up to this point. LeBron ball is conducive to getting great stats and teammates open shots, but not building confidence and keeping the D honest."
"&gt;The reason why people dislike Kds move tbh is because it directly affected Lebron.   What the fuck are you talking about. It was bitch move and do not try to make it everything about James. Whole western conference was pissed off, because any rivalry is gone.  "
"Criticizing LeBron here comes with the downvotes but I don't mind. Internet points don't do jack, heh. I do appreciate you looking past the downvotes and engaging me civilly :)    It's exactly as you say, sure James is a fantastic player, nobody here doubts that. It's more that he has to be the one in the driver seat at all times, he won't accept a role that relegates him to a second or third option; he has to be first or nothing. It's why the team more or less solely revolves around him, and to some extent, suffers for it.   This why I'm very much interested in what the offseason holds, because if Lebron jumps ship, will he consider taking a bit of a backseat for a younger team?"
"No problem. You got downvoted but you were accurate in your assessment imo. I think LeBron is a great player but Bosh tried to tell everyone about the sacrifice it takes to play with LeBron and it's like no one listened. When James tried to play in a more diverse offensive system his 1st year in Miami, he looked lost at times and it came full circle against the Mavs. The following year, DWade took a step back and let him do his thing to make him more comfortable. It worked because Wade made the sacrifice, not LeBron adjusting, plus he proved himself when he won without James. Kyrie was still getting downplayed after he was amazing in the finals. Plus, LeBron made a statement about ""giving him the keys when he's ready"", as if he couldn't sacrifice some of his game to let Kyrie run the show more. That's why Irving left and is what Bosh was referring to. "
Lebron = King James  Bogie = [Slav King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIjKijhv1OU)
"You threw and intentionally lost professional NBA games in a multibillion dollar business for  consecutive years. It got to the point where the NBA commissioner himself had to come in and bring his own people into your front office after firing everyone there.  Let me tell you something about the Miami HEAT culture:  -Lebron James left his hometown team to join our organization. -We were on the list of teams Kyrie Irving wanted to be traded to. -Kevin Durant interviewed with us when he was a free agent. -We Won three championships this decade, not in the ABA Era. -We will never throw professional games intentionally for draft picks. Fans work to hard for that and the NBA product deserves to be treated better.  Batteries. Santa Claus. Philly."
"I agree with you to an extent. It works both ways with LeBron being physical. James is rarely in foul trouble even though he's just as physical on the defensive end. Shaq and Dwight got into foul trouble more often than LeBron does, so I can completely understand people's opinion on the refs favoring him. He might not get to the free throw line as much as he should, but they let him play in other facets "
The last time Lebron James went down 1-2 vs. Indiana Pacers in a series he had Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on his team

"Kevin Love yelled, ""Panic attack!"" Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, ""We got a fucking first round exit now."" And before Lebron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, ""Ya'll still suck like in the regular season."""
That has nothing to do with the Heat and everything to do with LeBron James.
"The Cavs' intensity both offensively and defensively should not wane in the second half, they should be exerting maximum effort all through the game. Its a playoff game ffs and I am bewildered by how lethargic and easy going they are. You are 2 games away from losing this series and an ignominy of a first round exit for LeBron. Next game is a must win for the Cavs and although they have held the Pacers to less that  100 in the past 2 games, they need to kickstart their offense now. You can always count on James to turn up when it matters the most but the others need to find their groove and hit their shots."
Do you have any proof at all that Lebron James strong-armed Cavs management into getting TT his contract?
It's amazing and very strange that LeBron might not make it to the finals... but one thing we must all remember: do not doubt LeBron James. 
"&gt;Except Lebron makes his teammates better,  this is the perception, but is it true? Who has Lebron James actually made better? There's so many damned players that have come and gone with lebron, and the vast majority were not better when playing with him. "
"Woj: LeBron James has decided to take his talents to Long Beach, sources say...  Probably..."
"*Nick Wright after Game 3**  ""LeBron is such a giver! He's purposely losing games to give the Pacers false hope before he destroys them. You can have your James Harden. LeBron IS MY MVP"" "
They don't need a closer. They have Lebron fucking James and his clutch shots kept the game close in the end.  They were up by 17 at one point. When they need is for their fucking role players to be consistent.
"They've gotten progressively worse these past few years imo. But they've never really been great. Its obvious that they referee with a bias. Take Lebron for example. They tend to hold their whistle if he were to get hacked at the rim compared to say, a James Harden. Same with Shaq back in the day.    And just watching these last few games this series, they seem to carry a narrative. Oh the Cavs lost on the road in the first game of the series? Let's keep the Pacers' best player on the bench damn near the entire game with some questionable calls. Or even today to show I'm not being bias. Pacers are making a valiant comeback? We're gonna pretend we didn't see that kick ball on a critical play in the game.   Just some things you pick up after looking at the game objectively. I'm not saying their job isn't hard. Human error is going to happen ofcourse. It's just that you're supposed to be trained so that these things happen as seldom as possible. Yet they happen pretty much every game. My only complaint in the initial comment above was that the constant moaning about something we as NBA fans should be used to in the gamethread was excessive and annoying. Hope that clears it up for you"
"He was easily better than James in 2015. Can't believe people are impressed by LeBron scoring on literal garbage efficiency (seriously, he made Westbrook look like Curry). Curry or KD would've scored those points on much better efficiency against that Warriors defense.  He was the second best after KD in 2017. LeBron's defense was trash and he was busy statpadding while getting blown out, which is actually his signature move.  He was actually garbage against the Blazers and not even good against the Thunder (thank god Westbrook sucks absolute ass at defense lol)"
I didn't think the pacers would win a series not that it was over.  But the Fact that the Cavs were a 4 with how much king james was playing instead of their usual two seed with lebron sitting out made me think they were more vulnerable this year
The Cleveland Cavaliers are 0-1 since LeBron James bought his teammates matching suits. 
Boohoo I’m lebron James. 
"As someone who is generally not a fan of the player Lebron James, I feel its because whatever team hes on, the offense just becomes the Lebron offense. Then when Lebron gets tired, it stops working because thats all the team knows and no one else can do what Lebron does. I think its coaching but also the pitfalls of just having such a singular player centric offense, when that player has such a unique skillset. Everything is just Lebron all the time."
"Oh God, this finally came here. Mike Felger, a bucks fans and Boston radio host on 98.5, has been asking for weeks whether green-teamers would rather have a star or Brad Stevens in a 1:1 trade. It ramped up to Brad Stevens for LeBron James 1:1 recently."
June 6th: Kevin Durant joins the Warriors  June 7th: Lebron James announces retirement.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
So you agree with the premise that the Lakers won't pursue LeBron James this year (at all) in favor of a potentially injured Kawhi in 2019?
"Why would the Sixers, or any team with an exceptional young nucleus of talent, want to even consider bringing in LeBron James to ruin it all?? Seriously?? LeBron has to be the Alpha-dog and would ruin everything."
&gt;[Lebron has never played with a big man who took the pressure off of him let alone Shaquille O’Neal (who won all 3 final mvps btw).](http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Shaquille+O+Neal+LeBron+James+Cleveland+Cavaliers+dWl2GC8Fk8ql.jpg)  
Lebron James will sign with the Memphis Grizzlies because he once heard the Marc Cohn song “Walking in Memphis” and believes taking 4-5 steps is acceptable in Memphis as opposed to the 3 steps he takes everywhere else.   
"Just straight up multiplying TS% and your initial outcome above may work. Here's what the numbers come out to.     | PPG * sqrt(GP) ---|--- Michael Jordan | 986 Kareem Abdul Jabar | 972 Karl Malone | 960 Lebron James | 920 Kobe Bryant | 917 Shaquille O'Neal | 823 Dirk Nowitzki | 813 Kevin Durant | 752   | PPG * sqrt(GP) * TS% ---|--- Kareem Abdul Jabar | 575 Michael Jordan | 560 Karl Malone | 553 Lebron James | 539 Kobe Bryant | 503 Shaquille O'Neal | 482 Dirk Nowitzki | 470 Kevin Durant | 459   The only change between the two after TS% is added to the equation is Kareem moving ahead of MJ, which I think makes sense in this list of scorers. If Lebron does average 27 while playing 75 games next season and his TS% remains unchanged his score here would be 556, which would move him just above Malone.  In case anyone checks my math I rounded down to the nearest integer."
"*My preferred stats show 3 role players are the best scorers in the league. Therefore my stats are the intelligent one* FOH  Ppg is the best scoring stat. Even if you just blatantly ignore all the role players that are the top of this list Lebron freaking James and Giannis Antetokounmpo are apparently worse scorers than Steph Curry and Kyrie Irving.   If you're a biased Steph or Kyrie fan then this stat is perfect for you which is obviously the case. Hell Michael Jordan according to per 36 stats was the [203rd leading scorer in 1998](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1998_per_minute.html). Hmm, maybe he didn't deserve the scoring title that year after all. I am so smart!"
Underrated Stat: LeBron James is #1 in assists alltime for a non-point guard with 8208.
"According to [this](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/17/17364284/lebron-james-free-agency-2018-mercenary) Ringer article, we can sign LeBron and sign J.J as long as it's under $10m/yr.   &gt; If the Sixers went all in with a monster trade package headlined by Markelle Fultz, Dario Saric, Robert Covington, the no. 10 pick, draft-and-stashes, and Jerryd Bayless’s salary, they could theoretically have a Big Three with Embiid, Simmons, and Leonard, and still retain max cap space to sign James if J.J.

"The other thing that is driving me crazy is the labeling of everybody who ever played in the NBA a Choke because they had some bad playoff moments. Its getting to the point where there is no such thing as a good playoff nba player.. The NBA is made up of a bunch of talented players trying like mad to win and thats amped up more in the playoffs. Its going to be impossible for someone to always perform well in the playoffs because there are other extremely talented players on the other side of the ball fighting them tooth and nail. You are going to have games and series where you don't play well, no matter who you are. Its so absurd I think everybody has been ruled out as clutch player, so everybody is now a choke. I guess its just luck whenever somebody wins  the whole thing then?  Curry is just the latest guy incorrectly and unfairly getting dumped on for being a choke. I saw several people claim he has never performed well in the playoffs (have you even watched the last 4 years?). This nonsense also been really unfairly been applied to a bunch of other players like Chris Paul (have you seen his playoff number, they are insane) &amp; Lebron James (yah 2011 was bad but how many transcendent performances and clutch shots does he need to give you to make up for that????).  James Harden's has been overblown and I can throw D'Antoni in there as well."
"some people in this sub legitimately believe that LeBron James is a cyborg, that's irrelevant"
"&gt;Lowry is garbage and so is derozan. No tantrum. Just facts.   You're letting everyone know how ignorant you are (as if arguing for Kobe as GOAT wasn't already doing that, lol). If you think the two best players of a team that has went 56-26, 51-31, and 59-23 in the last three seasons (making the Conference Finals, semifinals, and semifinals respectively) are garbage, you are such an idiot it's not even funny. The level of stupid you have to be to believe that is concerning.   &gt;You still can’t name the 5-6 players better because there aren’t.   Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal. Arguably Larry Bird and Tim Duncan. Easy.   &gt; Kobe was something like a 9 time all nba defensive player  Jordan was a 9x NBA All-Defensive First Team member as well. I'm not even gonna bring up the teams Kobe made off of reputation alone. Jordan also won a Defensive Player of the Year award (Kobe never won even one) while being the greatest scorer the league has ever seen.   &gt; Has the most assists for a shooting guard for all time   Jordan averaged more APG (5.3 vs. 4.7). He's only ~600 assists behind Kobe despite playing ~250 less games.   If you take away Jordan's two Wizards years and Kobe's first three seasons and last three seasons, Jordan *still* edges him out in APG (5.4 vs. 5.3).  &gt; Was the most ruthless scorer of all time   ""Ruthless scoring"" means nothing. Jordan was a much, much better scorer than Kobe and there's no debate to be had. It's pure ignorance to think otherwise.   Kobe averaged 30 or more PPG three times. Jordan did it eight times. Kobe averaged 35 or more PPG once. Jordan has done it twice. Kobe led the league in scoring twice. Jordan did so *ten times*.  Kobe never had a season of 60% or greater TS%. Jordan did it four times, which is insanity when you consider that he barely made or took threes. Jordan has six seasons with a TS% greater than Kobe's highest career TS%.   Jordan averaged 33.4 PPG on 56.8% TS over his playoff career. Kobe averaged 25.6 PPG on 54.1% TS.  The existence of Michael Jordan alone automatically eliminates Kobe from GOAT contention. He was a much better scorer (better efficiency on higher volume), has a more impressive defensive resume, was at worst an equal playmaker, and led better team to more championships. There is literally no argument at all for Kobe over Michael Jordan.   &gt; He had so much skill and talent that puts him above any other player of all time.  It absolutely doesn't. There are plenty of other equally or greater skilled players and even players who you can argue were less ""skilled"" but better due to their skills + athleticism or physical gifts (LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal)  &gt;  Do some research and see how deep the West was during the Kobe era and you will see how valuable Kobe’s 5 championships were.   Jordan has more championships and was the undisputed best player for all of them    Kobe averaged 15.6 PPG on 41.1% TS during the 2000 Finals. I don't doubt that he played great defense, but those numbers are atrocious.    &gt; And if you think Shaq carried Kobe then you didn’t watch any laker games from 2000-2003  I didn't say Shaq carried Kobe. Kobe was a crucial part of those runs as well. I said that Shaq was the better player throughout the three-peat.   Please tell me you're trolling  "

"I don't think Trae will be as good as Steph, but I study shooting mechanics extensively and Trae's release is actually a tiny hair quicker than Steph's.  Release speed is determined mostly by two factors. 1) The amount of pause at the set point 2) The release point.  1) Steph is a one motion shooter like Trae Young (a contrast is a two motion shooter like Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, etc. who pauses the ball temporarily at the set point and then propels the ball forward and up). They both have virtually no pause at the set point.   2) Trae actually has a lower release point than Steph who brings the ball up farther as he releases and takes a fraction of a second longer. This does mean Trae's shot is slightly more blockable, but he also gets it off earlier so the two somewhat cancel each other out. A good contrast of release points is Chris Paul and Eric Gordon. Chris Paul has a high release point and you'll notice his actual shot takes a lot longer, but Eric Gordon has a very low release point. They are both able to get their shots off against close and tall defenders, but in different ways, it's height of release versus speed of release."
"OP is an ass.  What the answer for what Lebron would sign with Memphis is the following.  **MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES**  Lebron James remembers the draft lottery when the Memphis Grizzlies was in the final two to get the #1 draft pick and if the Grizzlies had been the lottery winner, he would have played on a more complete team than he went to in Cleveland; he would have had a young Pau Gasol, Mike Miller, Shane Battier, and Jason Williams as his support, with a basketball genius in Hubie Brown as his coach. With the #1 pick, the Grizzlies would have drafted Kendrick Perkins and David West to support Lebron James and Pau Gasol. The Memphis Grizzlies would have won a championship within three seasons.  Knowing the heartbreak the underdog market missed out on the dream, LBJ wants to uplift Memphis like he did his home region. Memphis provides a more mature and team oriented version of Kyrie Irving in Mike Conley, and Marc Gasol is still one of the league’s best centers. With the #4 pick, the Grizz can bring in a young padawan for Lebron.  Memphis is a city of KINGS. The Pharoahs. Elvis. The legacy of ML King. Jerry “The King” Lawler. King James."

"He made like 50% of his decent three-point looks against the Pelicans. So shit. Now so far against Rockets he's made like 10%.   Also against the Pelicans he really didn't look like he was dying from exhaustion for the most of the game, I checked the replays.  He still has almost 60% true shooting these playoffs, one of the highest numbers of all high-volume players that played, right between LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Ah, Steph, the utter shit he plays all the time."
Lebron James Jr is a few years away
&gt; When Morris was finally put on him Lebron started to slowly take less shots and passing the ball away.  I think James' injury had more to do with that then anything else.

Especially coming from somebody with Lebronto flair. They are angry and bitter at this point. They are still likely 2 disappointing seasons away from starting a tanking process.

Maybe Lebronto will be relevant again in the mid to late 2020’s.  Just in time for Lebron James Jr.

Blatt went from his best player being some European dude to his best player being lebron james.
"Simmons playing off ball might as well be Tristan Thompson on offense, you can get away with it, but it isn't ideal, and if you can get an All-Star caliber player who can run the offense when LeBron wants a break and also play off-ball, that's much more ideal than a guy who has a lot of potential to be a great player, but can't shoot outside of 5 feet from the basket. If they have LeBron James you are in win-now mode, if they aren't willing to trade Ben Simmons for a player who gives them a better chance to win over the next three to five years, even it isn't a 1:1 value trade, then they shouldn't bother trying to sign LeBron at all.

"Eh. He was healthy enough to ball out when he wasn't getting gassed by constantly being attacked on both ends of the court all day.

"I mean I don’t really care about Steph I want him to play poorly, but I can understand why he is. Lets not pretend like he didn’t have 16 7 7 yesterday though. That’s still good.   It’s not a ridiculous statement it’s a fact. [Here’s a link to prove it. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/section-nba/news/cavs-defense-stats-rankings-nba-finals-history-lebron-james/ltlm189pz5dm17lmki6pzjjeb) Cavs rank 23rd in defensive efficiency, only one team has ever made it to the playoffs being in the 20’s, which is the 2015 Cavs, and they were 20th. So yes, this is the worst defensive team that has ever made the playoffs.   How were the 2007 cavs not terrible? Going down the list of points scored here’s their squad after lebron. Drew gooden, Daniel Gibson, Sasha pavlovic, Zydrunis Illgauskus, Anderson Varejao, Damon Jones, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes. That team was a rebuilding team and they happened to be carried by the finals. Which one of those players isn’t completely terrible? Larry Hughes was the second best player on the team and he averaged 10ppg through the playoffs. Z and Gooden were the only two players that could even attempt to compete, the rest was a bunch of players past their prime that wouldn’t be anywhere near a roster that wasn’t rebuilding. Let’s compare that to the spurs who had Tim Duncan, Genobli, Robert Horry, Tony Parker, After lebron the next best player on the Cavs wouldn’t make the top 10 comparing both squads. That’s kind of tough to beat.   Did you watch the NBA back then? The Heat weren’t even the favorites to win against the spurs. If you saw how good that team played together you’d understand. Arguably the best coach of all time and the best PF of all time. Yeah the 2016 team almost lost to the thunder but they didn’t, and that team had the most wins in NBA history before losing to lebron. That team had to add another star because of lebron James. An already historic team. Almost sweeped the thunder in the finals. The only finals that lebron absolutely shouldn’t have lost is against the mavs, who also weren’t some terrible team. Let’s not pretend like they didn’t have 4 former all stars and a 6th men of the year who is one of the top 3 point shooters in league history. And wade and bosh who were both up and down all season. 2 of those loses to spurs teams that were better than his, mavs loss that should have been won, and two loses to the warriors, one where he was absolutely out gunned last year and the other without Love and Irving or they probably would have won that year too. All in all that’s pretty fair, and why do we discredit lebron for making the finals the longest stretch in league history, but give props to player like Jordan who are 6-0 but had plenty of seasons where they lost earlier in the playoffs. You’re the one that brought up MJ out of absolutely nowhere.   Edit: here’s the most important stat if you don’t read anything else read this. When lebron left the Cavs they went from a finals squad to the worst team in the league and the #1 pick. When MJ left the first time they only lost one more game the next season without him. "

"You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at LeBron James and you look at Anthony Davis and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you play one on one with another player, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But LeBron is a genetic freak and he's not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, to win the MVP. Then you add James Harden to the mix, the chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at the NBA Awards Show, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but LeBron, LeBron has got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because James Harden KNOWS he can't beat him and he's not even gonna try! So if you take Anthony Davis's 33 1/3 chance, minus LeBron's 25% chance and Anthony Davis got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at the NBA Awards show. But then you take LeBron's 75% chance of winning, if they was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 percents, LeBron got 141 2/3 chance of winning at the NBA Awards. See Harden and Davis, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at the NBA Awards."
"Maybe you shouldn't talk then when your ""not even sure"" about stuff then or use the internet to look it up..  Chris Paul finished in second place with 894 points behind Kobe with 1100. Lebron James finished 4th with  438 points."
how people think lebron james is so good that he can beat any team just by himself
For sure. But let's not act like Lebron's defense or the Cavs defense for that matter is not the main reason they suck.   You can have a bad shooting night and still win if your defense is solid. Especially when your offense will rarely stagnate given you have Lebron James on your roster.
"Yeah, I'm not so sure about any of this...  I've seen what this team can do when everyone is healthy, but I've also seen how deadly Durant can be on his own, and obviously how absurdly dangerous Steph is at, say, even 80%. I've seen Klay casually drop 40 and Draymond become a black hole in the paint. Even with Steph at 50% this team is still my favorite to win the Finals.  Just like I hate how everyone is talking about the Cavs being finished. It's fucking Lebron James' world and the rest of the East is just living in it. We won two at home and we're celebrating a new dynasty already. I don't like anyone sleeping on Cleveland, I don't like anyone sleeping on Steph, and I definitely don't like anyone thinking the Warriors are finished because they're ""only"" up 1-1 after two games in Houston.   If Steph sucks in game 3 and the Warriors lose in Oracle, then we can talk. Until then, this still just looks like the 5-game series everyone was predicting two days ago."
"In a world where LeBron James is never born,  the Pacer fans and Raptor fans live in blissful harmony.  A fierce rivalry, splitting Eastern Conference Championships over a decade,  united by a shout in unison: FUCK THE CELTICS!!!"
"&gt;	LeBron James has fallen on hard times in this postseason. The Cavaliers are a dented car heading home from Boston, running on empty with tape holding together a cracked windshield and dragging the tailpipe along the pavement. And it’s the King behind the wheel.  *Groan*  This is why The Ringer will never be Grantland "
"He was usually top 10 and for around a decade was always at least debatably top 10.  I'd say Chris Paul, James Harden, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Giannis, at a *minimum* are all ""superstars."" Some years it's more. Some less. But it's pretty rare for only 5 guys to deserve that title."
LeBron “Odinson” James 
&gt; Except this is Lebron James not Dwight fucking Howard  It's actually about Clint Capela 
Except this is Lebron James not Dwight fucking Howard. Dwight had already noticeably regressed before he joined the Rockets. Lebron just had one of his 5 seasons offensively.

"No of course not. If he had a concussion it would have been easily diagnosed. He passed the tests and returned to the game a short time after. Unless LeBron, the Cavs doctors, the franchise, and the NBA are orchestrating a conspiracy theory to allow LeBron James to play concussed, he pretty clearly wasn't concussed lol."
"&gt; but you're perfectly happy rooting millionaires who play basketball.   I don’t remember lebron James asking poor people to donate money to him so that they can one day be rich thanks to Gods favor (which he assures you’ll have if you give him money)  Not sure what could possibly make you defend one of the least pious people I’ve ever heard of, but I guess if he wasn’t good at pulling the wool over peoples eyes he wouldn’t be wealthy to begin with...."
"I live in Portugal. The Cavs are somewhat popular due to LeBron James. However, the two most popular teams are the Bulls and the Lakers, followed closely by the Celtics."
Lebron James has literally normalized the 40+/10+/10+ game and its insane how ungrateful some people are and I say this as a LBJ hater.
"In Game 1, Curry had 4 points in the 4th quarter. Kyrie Irving had 8 points in the 4th quarter. Lebron James had 11 points in the 4th.  And no, it was Andre Iguodala who took over the 4th quarters later in the series and that got won him FMVP."
Lol what happened to the Raptors defense? The Warriors could lose the next 2 and I'd still have more faith in them to come back and sweep the finals than I would in DeMar not being intimidated by LeBron James for a second. 
LeBron James
Boston does it too but they are more sharp with it. They only double when Lebron gets to certain spots in the paint and when they do the weakside defender covers the passing lane by guarding two players at once by playing the gap between them waiting to intercept the pass from James on either side. This is what the Warriors do as well and they force Lebron into a lot of turnovers that way. I think that's why Lebron posted up less in game 2 and shot more 3s. He needs do damage in a different way and force double teams on different spots on the floor.
"https://www.si.com/vault/2002/02/18/318739/ahead-of-his-class-ohio-high-school-junior-lebron-james-is-so-good-that-hes-already-being-mentioned-as-the-heir-to-air-jordan  He had that nickname already at 17, before his senior year of high school started. I think it’s pretty hard to blame him for something like that."
"lol ok. You're just being irrational then. You're saying LeBron won't want to join what would be one of the best starting lineups of all\-time \(I struggle to think of another starting lineup with 3 guys who are top 5 all\-time at their positions, not to mention the #2 GOAT and the reigning MVP\), because the bench is not strong enough?  Hmm, has LeBron ever joined a team that had so much invested in the starting 5 that they had to fill up the bench with ring\-chasers? \(Yes, Miami\)  How did that turn out? \(4 Finals appearance and 2 rings in 4 seasons\)  Would the Rockets starting lineup be significantly better than the Heatles? \(Yes\)  Would the Rockets bench still actually be alright, given that it is 7th, 8th, and 9th men from the Rockets bench of this Playoffs \+ ring chasers? \(Yes\)  Has LeBron frequently spoken of his desire to play with CP3 before his career is over? \(Yes\)  And the biggest LOL of all \- LA would have more to offer to compete for championships??? What???? Sorry CP3 \(top 30 player all\-time\) and James Harden \(top 5 SG of all\-time and this year's MVP\), Lonzo\+Randle\+Ingram are better than you. "
"In the regular season Durant was better defensively but he missed a lot of games so I don't know about all-nba. In the playoffs both have been up and down defenders but Lebron has been better.  Only 6 players have more blocks than James in the playoffs so far and they're all defensive specialists [(Capela, Gobert, Davis, Horford, Draymond, and Valanciunas)](https://stats.nba.com/leaders/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;StatCategory=BLK&amp;PerMode=Totals). Only 5 players have more steals [(Harden, Paul, Draymond, Smart, and Davis)](https://stats.nba.com/leaders/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;StatCategory=STL&amp;PerMode=Totals).   He's [18th in deflections](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=DEFLECTIONS&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals), 8th in [loose balls recovered](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=LOOSE_BALLS_RECOVERED&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals), tied for [3rd in charges drawn](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=CHARGES_DRAWN&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals), 18th in [contested 2 point shots](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=CONTESTED_SHOTS_2PT&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals), and 7th in [contested 3 point shots](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?sort=CONTESTED_SHOTS_3PT&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals). Durant doesn't appear on these lists."
"If you're a casual NBA fan you will 100% turn on the Finals if it's LeBron, Steph, and KD. If it's somehow James Harden vs....Al Horford and some dude name Scary Terry the NBA is going to lose a shit ton of viewers.   Obviously I want the latter but star power gets eyeballs. "
"You can’t compare the two series though. This series looks tight. Both are great teams.  The Celtics have been spanking the Cavs until tip off. The Cavs don’t even look like they’re in the Celtics’ league the majority of the game.   Yes, the Cavs have LeBron James, but this is the worst roster of the past 8 years that LeBron has had to carry.   You’re right though. Reddit thrives on hot takes."
"The supporting cast is eventually what's going to help Cleveland and Houston make it to the Finals. As great as LeBron is, I don't think the Cavaliers will make it past the Celtics with the Hill &amp; Smith playing like crap.   We've all seen it. Both James' dropped 40 and still lost. "
"For real I just don't understand what OP was thinking all the Cavs have to do is get the ball out of the hands of Lebron James and let high IQ players like JR Smith makes those plays. The Warriors have made a multi\-year dynasty of 2 championships by using free flow offense and elevating the play of people like Kevin Durant to a level that could be MVP level one day. What have the Cavs done with their ISO basketball? They only have 1 championship and are nowhere close to a dynasty. Now sure for the Warriors first finals win Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were injured and they still managed to take it to 6 games but that was luck definitely not giving your best player like Lebron James the ball more and letting him make more of an impact on the game. As you could tell by the next year when the Cavs just got lucky and won with their ugly ISO ball. Because the very next year the Warriors managed to win again and they only had to add an MVP player in their prime. Get out of here with your nonsense OP. If the Warriors trust players like Durant, Thompson, Green, Curry, and Iggy to make plays for them then the Cavs should trust players like Tristan Thompson, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson, and Kevin Love to make plays too"
"Same in the Cavs series tbh. You would think out of the last 14-15 years people would learn to stop counting out LeBron fucking James. Not saying he will prevail again but even until Celts are 3-0 up 20 with :59 left in the 4th, game 4 — still not counting them out "
"The fact of the matter is that an offense which predicates moving the ball and consistent off-ball motion is the ideal that all teams should strive for when they are building a team. It's much more difficult to defend a balanced offensive attack than one based on isolation sets and one or two guys jacking up 20+ shots each. Now, obviously, having LeBron fucking James on your team is an exception to this. He dominates the ball and singularly controls the offense because he is arguably the greatest basketball player ever. And further, his domineering style emphasizes spreading the ball around and getting his teammates involved, rather than jacking up 30+ shots as Westbrook so often does. So, for the 29 teams that don't have a once-in-a-lifetime type of all around talent like LeBron, your only real hope of winning a title in this modern era is to spread out the floor and move the ball around. It's simply too easy to defend teams that rely on one or two guys playing iso-ball."
"Players don't magically go from averaging 15, 16 to zilch for no reason. Remember jae Crowder? He was good, came to cleveland, was crap, left, and is now a serviceable player. Rodney Hood was originally a very productive player on a playoff team who could get his own looks. George Hill is a veteran point guard who has played on many teams. Jordan Clarkson you might have a case because he's been on the Lakers but it's absolutely ridiculous to just say: these players are trash.  Also, JR Smith used to be 6th man of the year.  It is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous, and completely insulting to just say that these players are trash. Here's the truth of the matter: the moment they came onto Cavs LeBron decided they would never be allowed to make their own plays and they would just be spot up shooters, wasting their talent, taking away from their opportunities, and putting them out of rhythm. LeBron decides who gets the ball and when and only he can hold the ball on all these possessions. Just as he wont let any coach coach him he wont let lesser players hold the ball. This is a theme that happens exclusively with LeBron James, nowhere else in the league do young hopeful productive players go to kill their careers.  The rare opportunities they do get the ball? They fumble it because they have no rhythm. It's a never-ending circle. Lebrons team is the only continual playoff team that lacks chemistry, this isnt a thing on other teams. Oh Kevin Love is decent, eh? The man used to average 26/15. Even when kyrie left did LeBron let Love do more? Nope, still just a spot up shooter. The result? LeBron pads his stats and walks away Scot free while playing no defense any casual fans and the media point fingers at his supporting cast who effectively had their roles and rhythm and production taken away from them.  Why do you think Kyrie left? He averaged the most points ever when he was on the Cavs. He got all his isolation plays and shots and whatnot, but he knows. He knows with LeBron at the helm that they would never run an actual offensive system, that his supporting cast will perform like rubbish, that he might make it to the finals every year to lose to an actual team, all while LeBron plays no defense, pads his stats, and plays the blame game. LeBron James does not utilize his role players well, at all, and it is the exact reason why, even if he beats the Celtics, will get squashed in the Finals anyways."
LeBron James is the Cavs primary ball handler. Kevin Durant's job is mainly to score.
Lebron James put up 40 and the Cavs got crushed.   Kevin Durant put up 40 and the Warriors got crushed.  Rockets vs Celtics confirmed 
You know Lebron James will show up the question is whether his supporting cast will 
Two home wins by a young team missing their two best players to injuries doesn’t mean they’ll win a series against LeBron James 🤷🏻‍♂️
"Prior to that shot, Coach David Blatt called timeout with none remaining. A while back Windhorst (while on Lowe's podcast) said that the referee saw Blatt call the timeout and just simply waived him off. Had the ref done his job correctly and given Blatt a technical foul, this shot would have never have happened, and the Cavs would have been down 3-1 in the series. And as we all know, it is statistically impossible to come back when down 3-1 in the playoffs.   Edit: This 3 year old reddit comment says [Zach Lowe tweeted that Scott Foster saw Blatt call for a timeout, but waved him off while nodding his head ""no"". ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/35jan1/mcmenamin_david_blatt_on_the_timeout_he_tried_to/cr5a41t/)  Edit 2: It looks like Lebron overruled Blatt for the game winning shot. “To be honest, the play that was drawn up, I scratched it,"" James said. ""I just told coach, ‘Give me the ball. We’re either going to go to overtime or I’m going to win it for us.' It was that simple."""
"How tf do you get a rebound like that, turn around, and out of *all* possible people to pass to, choose the guy on the other side of the court surrounded by 3 opponents?   I guess only when “the guy” is LeBron James but still. "

"But what are your actual reasons why? You hate LeBron the basketball player because of how he's played and what he's done during his career or you hate the man, the person that is LeBron James?"
"I was just in the game thread and apparently people actually think the Celtics have a chance to beat Lebron and the Cavs. I think that’s hilarious. Idk if this is agains the rules but does anyone want bet? Gold bet? Lebron gets way too much disrespect on this sub, Kyrie is the biggest snake the game has ever seen. The kid had the perfect career laid out for him. I hope he realizes how badly he fucked up his career instead by refusing to work with pretty much certainly the best teammate in NBA history... poor kid, coulda been one of the greats. Oh well. Lebrons going to the finals with or without you. Anyway what do you think? The Celtics are gonna *flip the switch* at home? Brad Stevens gonna *wave* his magic wand and make T. Rozier III able to bang with Lebron in the post? Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown the rookie GOATS gonna start hitting wide open shots and stop biting on fakes?  Anyway,  To the people who bring up the Celtics magic home presence? The Cavs haven’t shown they can beat you at home? How many playoff series has Lebron beat the Celtics in again...? You guys are delusional man, you really are. It’s like a cult haha. What about this trash Celtics team makes you think they can beat the Cavs? Al Horford? Soft. Terry rozier? Jeremy Lin part 2. Jason Tatum? Rookie. Kyrie Irving? Out. Lebron james? GOAT.  Edit: to everyone who agrees let’s get this post to the top. guarantee Celtics fans are gonna think they’re above this and that I’m just some troll but you know what? This is bullshit. This Celtics team is damn near the most overrated team of all time "
"though it's been said, many times, many ways, LeBron James is just fucking incredible"
"Everyone doubts Lebron James. Everyone thought the series was over after they went down 2-0. The Cavs have Lebron, they will always have a shot with him. I think with JR and Hill finding their groove, the games at Boston will be different. "

They don't even think he is the best SF....  And don't say KD, that's not sincere. Lebron and KD have always had similar scoring numbers, while LeBron does everything else at a higher level. "

"With or without home court, going into this series, the Rockets were not expected to get any farther than a six game loss by everyone except people paid to take hot-like-fire takes. There isn’t pressure on the defending champs in their own backyard, they haven’t lost since game 7 of the finals. They are so much better now than then, as crazy as it is to say that, they would blow either of the teams in that finals out 4 out of 5 games.   A 2-2 series, or any game amount besides 4 wins in 7 games and hindsight could ever have the Rockets as the favorite in any definition of the world. D’antoni isn’t feeling that that, he’s trying hard to deflect from an increasingly alarming disaster happening to every team looking to contend. The Warriors are that good and anyone who’s been watching them evolve since those 3 successive lightning strikes can see from the eye test alone how far away from feeling pressure they have been since they added KD. They’re so confident they will ultimately win a series they can go out and work a team any night they want to.   You need at least one Lebron James or Kevin Durant to contend against the Warriors core and they went out and killed one bird with two stones a few years ago.   "

"There isnt any physical evidence against Iggy beside what his body looks like. Therefore I'm not going to consider allegations against him. There is in fact physical evidence against Lebron James doping. The Miami clinic that Alex Rodriguez got busted for being associated with was searched thouroughly and a vial that had the initials ""LJ"" was subsequently found. Someone who was named in court as ""Mr. Paul"" would also come into the Miami clinic every month to collect this LJ vial. As in Rich Paul, Lebron's agent. That is solid evidence in my opinion, not just saying ""everyone dopes therefore so does Iguodala"" "
If we get to single digits Cavs will need Lebron James or other non\-Korver role players to step up a little.
If LeBron James beats the Warriors and wins the championship with this garbage team he’s better than Jordan.

I love Lebron James. I would give almost anything for him to come play for my Knicks. But I really do think some people are allowing recency bias to cloud their judgment when it comes to Jordan comparisons.  And this isn't just a Lebron vs Jordan problem it is an Internet (modern media landscape) problem. We have this need to declare the latest thing the greatest thing ever because we want to elevate whatever we're currently experiencing above everything else historically. We want to be a part of history in the making. And this urge seems to have become magnified in the past 10 years.    I think some of it comes from a weird sense of insecurity that makes us feel that if this great thing we follow isn't the best ever that it is some how less legitimate of an experience than what came before.         
"Kevin Durant and some other people are better overall players than Lebron James. More talented or better superstars? No. However for me while I can't say for certain James certainly appears quite on coachable and unable to just play his role. Which I why I guess Blatt situation never worked out.  Like I said can't obviously be 100&amp;#37; certain about it from the outside. But if I'm correct on that, then I stand by that. Also it's not just James, I have similar understanding about Westbrook and many others."
Fun fact:  Lebron James intentionally take a pay cut at 26 his prime just to win a chip with another 2 HoFers Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade
"Your question is interesting IF you consider the context of a sign-and-trade or opt-in-and-trade for lebron.  When you look at Cleveland's cap situation, such a trade is nigh impossible without involving a third team to take a salary dump.  And taking a salary dump of awful contracts would mean that third team would need significant assets (draft picks) to do it, which the hypothetical team trading for lebron does not have.  Or as the Rockets FO would put it, ""we have no intention to pursue Lebron James."""
Exactly. Then when he wins its all him. I understand that the Cavs players don't step up sometimes when it's needed but don't change the narrative. If it's a team game when Lebron James loses. It's one when he wins too.
"well if this version of the celtics somehow knocks off the team that quickly dismantled him and Lebron James and is on pace to make quick work of James Harden and Chris Paul, then i'll be worried lmao"

I think this season will give LeBron James a good shot next year if he keeps it up. Everyone who deserves one has gotten one and the up and comers have many years ahead. That kind of psychology can swing votes. 
"James Harden has the ball more in his hands than Lebron does this playoffs just FYI. Harden's usage rating so far is 36.4 to Lebron's 35.9. You don't see it affecting the other Rocket players from doing their jobs.   The fact of the matter is the Cavs' role players are simply inconsistent, as has shown all regular season and playoffs. It's not a diss. It's simply a fact. "
Guys unpopular opinon but DAE appreciate Lebron James???   Praise geraldo
"The warriors now really don’t have any excuses for what’s happening. The things that are happening this series are things that they should be able to overcome due to sheer talent and star power.  Houston is hounding curry off ball and denying him catch and shoots pretty well-it’s getting him out of rhythm and disrupting the fuck out of his game. They’re straight up STOPPING him. But we’ve seen this before in 2016. Cavs did this to a T.   They’re also stopping the low post entry to draymond exceptionally well and that makes it difficult to run those corner sets for Klay and curry; which is why Durant is iso’ing so much.  But that’s just it, who the fuck here is gonna say Miami have what golden state has? Houston is disrupting three of their all stars and golden state still has a fourth guy who just happens to be a league mvp and impeccable iso scorer? Ariza is making it about as difficult as it can get, and curry is doing a solid job in KD individually.   But Miami did not have this luxury. When we got exposed in 2011 for our lack of shooting; we couldn’t have someone like lebron or bosh or wade bail us out because of lebron was our  primary ball handler in the corner and deshawn Stevenson and Shawn Marion were switching on and off him on ball like they were and allowing Miami the quick looks at three, the proper move would be for James to find an open man before the switch finished and have them either pump fake and drive or take the three.  Who was gonna take that shot? Wade with his sub 30% or bosh with his 29%? Joel Anthony? Or was it mike bibby or Mario chalmers who weren’t hitting a lot of their shots post game 2.  Yes, we could have isolated bron, and we did, but he wasn’t the greatest jumpsholter and having Tyson chandler coming forward on the weak side on a baseline drive was almost a guaranteed miss.  KD essentially negates all that because he can do what lebron couldn’t at that point in time. "
I don't know if I'll ever witness something so dominant as LeBron James in an elimination game in the NBA ever again. Just an absolute gem of a performance and he's done this so many times. 
"Anthony Davis cannot guard Lebron James sorry he wouldn't even be his matchup, Lebron had 37/8/8 on 14/23 shooting against Paul George last game, he had 40 pts and a game winner vs Jimmy Butler, I think KD is a legitimate defender but thats more because the warriors team defense is so scary good, see previous statement for klay thompson, PJ Tucker just stop it he may do a decent job but thats because the rockets are collectively good as a team, Melo just stop it Melo is one of the worst defensive players currently in the NBA so please stop, Trevor Ariza is also very good but they switch everything so lebron would constantly be guarded by chris paul or harden, Joe Ingles come on now man seriously your making yourself look bad."
What makes you think KD is the better scorer? LeBron and him average pretty much the same amount PPG wise and KD is right in the middle of his prime.  I get that KD could keep up his scoring like LeBron has over the next 5 years but in all likelihood he will slow down sooner than James and end up with a lower PPG. His TS% has a chance to stay slightly higher but that should also take a hit as he ages. 
*Cavs threw us off the loop*  They didnt play Lebron James so we annihilated them to our surprise
"It was unfair for that guy to take what you said out of context, but I watched James Harden get carried to a victory against arguable the best team left. I have never seen Lebron get carried and he playing against the Celtics-2 stars. "
Carmelo? Carmelo Anthony? You think Carmelo Anthony can guard Lebron James?  
wow lebron james jr put on quite a few pounds
"I’ve been to the last 3 nba finals.  I’ve seen 5 games and three of those the warriors lost because James went ballistic (2015: game 2 / 2016 games 5&amp;7).   My brothers always talk about getting to watch Jordan play. I only got to watch him on tv which was great, but I was younger and didn’t appreciate it as much. But I’m glad I got to see lebron in person and watch these games now. Despite the salt this is really fucking cool. "
"Honestly, a limping LeBron James is still probably more productive on the floor than 50% of the NBA"
"If you take Harden off the Rockets and LeBron off the Cavs, which team is gonna suffer more? And if we are “literally” talking about based on criteria, Value Over Replacement Player, LeBron is at 8.9 and Harden is at 8.3 for the regular season. If we’re talking best season, yeah sure Harden can have that, but LeBron James is the Most Valuable Player in the league, but people have grown used to his dominance and it’s no fun having the same MVP over and over and over again. New faces= New fans and more interesting story lines. "
"This James Lebron guy really is good, i see him on r/all all the time basketing the ball into the other sides circle ring thing. Mark my words you'll be seeing more of him."
"I think keeping it in basketball terms really drives your point home. Someone half as good as lebron is someone who is going to like average 14 /3.5/4 in the playoffs for their career in the nba. 50% of lebron james is like a Kevin love with a few less rebounds. The cavs would kill for someone 50% as good as lebron james.  So that's a very solid player in the nba, which is composed of the top .1% or better of basketball players. i think 50% of lebron james is probably still 6 sigma above the mean for basketball players. So you would be the excellence everyone strives to be"
"Who, Harden? It’s not about the counting stats, it’s about efficient shooting and playing a smart all around game, with amazing defense and limiting turnovers and other mistakes. That’s what separates those chasing triple-doubles from the GOAT LeBron James."
"""Dad, is it true what they say about Lebron James? No one came in second more than him?"""
LEBRON JAMES | WELCOME TO BESIKTAS | 1080P | DESPACITO
LeBron James is gonna destroy half of this sub
Nobody else has played as much NBA basketball over the last 8 years than Lebron James I’d bet. 
"no, he got down voted for dismissing LEBRON JAMES, yea not Tayshawn Prince or Erik Dampier, but LEBRON JAMES' legitimate case as the best basketball player ever like it was a 1 game overreaction. Like LeBron hasn't been doing this since 2007.  "
Sports especially basketball has helped me get through literal hell this year. That 7 game world series. A great NCAA tournament. And now Lebron James with his greatest postseason ever. It really helps. 
Remember when he came into the league and couldn’t hit the jumper? Remember when the general consensus was that Lebron always choked and was mentally weak? Remember when he couldn’t score on JJ Barea in the post in 2011?   I don’t think a player has ever evolved to the same extent as Lebron James. We are truly blessed as fans of the nba right now 
"When the series started, I told my kids how important it was that he was both a great player and person.  How he tries to help even if people don't always like him.  They started cheering for him and I had to explain that when LeBron James plays againat the Celtics, it's actually the Satan in a LeBron costume, so we must hate him with all of our hearts.  "
"I'm a very angry Celtics fan. Let me get this off my chest. I strongly disagree with you. And not because I'm salty my team just got the beatdown like the Raptors.   It's true, I hate watching LeBron. I hated watching LeBron in G6 in 2012 just like I hated watching LeBron today. But he's undeniably good. A basketball marvel. Probably the GOAT (until Tatum hits puberty at least). But here's why I disagree with you. I would be more proud if my son became off-court LeBron than if he became on-court LeBron (also I wouldn't have to disown him for becoming LeSon).   Let me put it to you this way. Name another Bill Simmons book of basketball pyramid, GOAT candidate that is a better basketball player and a better citizen, parent, sending 1,000 children to college, won't shut up and dribble, role model. Maybe Bill Russell is his only competition.   TLDR: It's not a privilege to watch LeBron James play basketball, that's just entertainment. If there's any privilege in watching LeBron it's watching him represent the best of basketball and the highest values of the NBA (if there are any beyond spicy memes). With everything the country is going through we need more of that.   I feel dirty like I just swan across the Charles writing that. I hope the Celtics crush the Cavs in game 7. I hope LeBron's fourth basketball prime is finally over but I'm glad I got to witness the era. "
"Is there an NBA player that could even possibly EVEN TOUCH LeBron James? Let alone defeat him. And I’m not talking about high school dual-athlete LeBron James.

Hell, I’m not even talking about ‘06 LeBron James with Mr. Potato Head as coach (equipped with all-star Mo Williams who was only an all-star because LeBron is so good at making his team mates look better than they are), averaging 31.4 PPG and should have won MVP over Steve Nash.

"Fuck LeBron James, I enjoy hating him and will continue to do so as long as he's in the league (unless he joins my team because this is just a fun foil kind of thing and I respect him a lot as a human being). "
Whos the next LeBron James? Because he's clearly surpassed Michael. 
It's the [second time this series](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/15/17359146/lebron-james-injury-neck-strain-game-2-cavs-celtics-nba-playoffs) a Cavs star has left a game with a head injury
1. Michael Jordan  2. Lebron James  3. Kareem   
LeBron James either has a triple-double or a 40-point game in each of his last 7 elimination games  you will get something!
"Don't care about the ""precedent"". LeBron should have won that Finals MVP. Most points, rebounds, assists of any player in the series, playing 46 minutes per game.  Roster of Mozgov, Smith, Thompson, Dellavedova, Shumpert, James Jones, Mike Miller, Kendrick Perkins, Joe Harris.   Fuck out of here him not winning that. Disgraceful."
Game 6. LeBron James. Name a more iconic duo. 
"Looks at username...sees ""kobe bryant""..understands why user feels the way he does. I know so many who thought kobe was going to be #2 behind jordan,and let's face it folks. By the time James retires people will remember Kobe,but they'll be talking about Lebron to their kids.  Nearly every bron hater is a Kobe fan. Wonder why?  :)"
Basketball is a game with one orange ball with 10 men chasing for it and in the end LeBron James wins
"Michael Jordan is 6'6'', weighs 195 lbs, and plays shooting guard.  LeBron James is 6'8'', weighs 250 lbs, and plays small forward.   There is the massive upper hand and that's why the difference between there rebounding totals is 1,743 rebounds favoring LeBron, with him having a good 3-4 years to expand that."
"I understand where you're coming from, but I will never lose faith in LeBron James. If he is there, anything is possible."
LeBron James either has a triple-double or a 40-point game in each of his last 7 elimination games  Boston are you ready?
"Lebron James career has a good lot of weak teams around him too (2008,2009,2010) and to a lesser extent of teammates injured/ letting him down (2014,2015)  No player is perfect, Jordan never won until celts and pistons got old and his team improved,magic played in a relatively weak west with amazing teammates, bird hd his own great teams for his career and still accomplished less than James, wilt only won twice  Any one has a nitpick to make about them if you want to go that way"
"LeBron ""Alexander Ovechkin"" James "
Cavs flair.. doubting LeBron James.. let me guess.. last year you had GSW flair up but changed it this year now that you realize GSW is overrated after the Rockets exposed them. 
They are doing a great job. Hate to say it but they could've swept us if they had both Kyrie and Hayward. Only reason I am not sure about getting swept to a healthy Celtics is LeBron James. 
"LeBron ""Son Goku"" James."
"At the game of basketball, you either die or face LeBron James. "
HAHAHAH Punk ass LEbron James?!?!?!?!? What happened to Lonzo BALL??? im sleep bruh yall recency bias is insane.
The is no fucking way in Helheim LeBron James did not ingest the Heart-Shaped Flower when he was a teen.
"It reminded me of Game 7 a couple years ago when James got fouled on the late game dunk attempt and landed funny and was on the ground for a while.  Something that would have had most players out for the rest of the game, and many more, but after a minute or two it's LeBron back to normal."
Lebron James is good at the game of basketball.
"I just disagree. I wouldn't rank that Spurs team as particularly special above a championship team. Which is still pretty special. Truthfully LeBron James is a top 5 player of all time, it's true. His longevity is great, but an awful lot is owed to the fact that he's been in the east. I just believe that to my core. Do you really believe he would have reached 8 straight finals in the west?  I don't think LeBron reaches Jordan level. I have biases, but I also just believe it's objectively true given what they did in their respective eras. I would be interested to see what Lebrons career would have been like on some place like portland. I have a hunch it wouldnt have been as successful, but I guess I don't know it either."
The bar gets lower every day for some LeBron James fans. If the Celtics win game 7 we'll hear about how incredible it was that 'Bron pushed the 2018 Celtics with their all-time great defense to 7 games.
Now this is kind of ridiculous. Lebron James.
Nothing. She watched in awe as LeBron goddamn James was walking away after shouldering that massive load.
Lebron James playoff run AT 33 YEARS OLD is as good as any playoff run in history... 7 out of the 17 games have been 40 bombs and he’s still getting his obligatory 10 boards and 9 assists a game 
Free The Celtics. It's a reference to the Cavaliers dominance of the east and LeBron James should have been fined.

face it... Celtics are trash and shouldn't have even made it this far. They're totally unprepared to handle LeBron James as most teams in the East are. No Celtic fan should have gotten their hopes up that they could win this series. Any talk that they had a chance was just plain foolish.

So my advice to all the Lebron haters out there, do not let your blind hatred stop you from appreciating one of the best players of all-time play the game we all love. Its just not worth it, you will be kicking yourselves when he retires.  We can get into arguments if him or MJ is better but ultimately that is irrelevant. Just enjoy and appreciate one of the best to ever do it."

"Things to note if you're a Celtics fan:  - Al Horford continues to have major shrinkage in big games. Expect more in Game 7.  - The Celtics need to put in a real effort on the glass, and they will have no chance in Game 7 if they don't.  - Greg Monroe is nearly unplayable in this series, he is absolutely not ready for prime time and a liability in almost every way.  - Celtics need to stop throwing the ball to Al Horford in the post when the Cavs are just going to double him. He's terrible at passing out of double teams in the post and it kills every possession when it happens.  - The C's must force LeBron James to his right. If you give LeBron his left when he's feeling it he will just stepback from that wing and embarrass them. It's happened time and time again and will continue to happen until they figure this out.  Some or none of this may be true, this is all really my opinion and I am just a dirty white boy. Go C's"

"Look, if you have a Gaussian with $\mu = 0.5, \sigma = 0.5$, the probability of obtaining an outcome of 0.2 or less from your random variable is 0.27  On the other hand, if you have a Gaussian with $\mu = 0.5, \sigma = 0.1$, that probability is 0.0013.   This is the very essence of the concept of high variance vs low variance  Kevin Durant, for all his faults and a tendency to choke, has always been a very low-variance scorer. He will get you 20+ points and rarely shoot below 30%.   LeBron James is the same way.   Same was true for MJ and Kobe back in the days (Kobe was probably the most variable player of them all).   Why is that? Because they have a reliable weapon. KD will shoot mid-range jumpers over everyone, MJ and Kobe had the turnaround jumper in the post, LeBron bullies his way to layups and dunks. Going further back, Kareem had an unstoppable skyhook, etc.  When you construct a team around 3s, FTs, and layups, you do not have that reliable weapon you can always go back to. The 3 is the most inconsistent shot in the game, FTs depend a lot on whether the refs will fall for your attempts to get them, or will call your BS and swallow their whistles, and layups are not that easy to get when defenses get really tight. And that inherently makes you a high-variance team, and especially so in the playoffs when defenses are ar their tightest and refs interpret the rules much more leniently. So the probability of obtaining those abysmal outcomes from time to time increases drastically, and particularly so in the playoffs.   Thus it is no surprise they end up happening.   Which is why the ""it's only one game"" argument is not really valid. "
"Yeah, I agree. It's one of those things that works well in the regular season by doesn't translate to great success in the postseason. It's frustrating because Harden is a great player but he'll need to adjust for the playoffs. This is one of the reason why LeBron James is a beast in the playoffs. He uses his body and just barrels into people when he needs to in addition to his shooting ability. LBJ is impossible to stop. "
It was good basketball - I’m shocked and absolutely amazed that Houston managed to push GS to 7 games. Hats off to them and CP3 especially for getting them this far. Next year come back reloaded and ready.  The warriors just showed us why they may very well be the most dominant team we’ve ever witnessed. 4 all stars two of which are superstars and of those two superstars one of them is the single greatest 3pt shooter in the history of the NBA. Incredible to witness.  On the other side we got to see the rise of Jayson Tatum. That kid is so special and he showed us so much this post season. Boston should be fucking happy as hell to have drafted that kid. He is a Celtic sure - but label me a fan of his because I love his game. On the other end of that Lebron has once again proven himself to be the most dominant force of his generation. To carry that garbage ass team to the finals? Leastern conference it may be but I’ve never seen a single player own a team the way Lebron did to the raptors.  Funny thing is I was hoping we’d see a Celtics rockets finals but unfortunately it’s round 4 of the GSW vs Lebron James and the cabbage patch kids. At this point I’m almost inclined to hope that Lebron does in fact pull a fucking a miracle and beat these warriors - because that would be greatness we get to witness.
Hate it. Barring injury. We all know the outcome. It's going to be Michael Jordan VS Lebron James the whole fucking summer in hot takes. Skip Bayless trolling. Stephen A hating. Sigh.
Because 1\) NBA loves Lebron James and the idea of winning one for the land. 2\) Extended series means better ratings.
LeBron James and being a good teammate. Also looking for a challenge (takes the easy ways out) which goes hand and hand with his loyalty. 
Until you realize Iggy is a former Finals MVP and the guy who can guard Lebron James probably better than any other player in the NBA.  #GTFOH
"Korver, Green and Hood (yeah I said it! Rodney Hood) are the keys to this series. My reasoning:  **Korver** - He needs to be able to come in and punish GS for any defensive mistakes, while simultaneously showing the same effort defensively that he did against Boston  **Green** - I think he has to be the one that draws the assignment of defending KD. You can't let LeBron expend the massive amount of energy it takes to guard KD on the defensive end. He has to be able to force KD into making tough shots and passes.  **Hood** - He needs to have some meaningful minutes this series. He's supposed to be one of the other guys on this team that can create his own shot and allow Lebron some time to breathe on offense. If he can come in and actually do that, and provide some positive +/- against the GS bench, they just might have a chance this series.  With that being said, I think it basically comes down to the fact that Cleveland not only has to play perfectly to be Golden State, in reality they have to outperform everything they've done so far which isn't really a fair ask to anyone not named LeBron James."

"There are two differences that make what KD did ""worse"": the Warriors were an *established* top tier team already, and they had beaten his team the year before.  That being said, the *intent* of what LeBron did was *exactly* the same. Citing the Heat's record before LeBron joined is a bit disingenuous, don't you think? His intent in joining the Heat was to team up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. If they could've done that on that Lakers, or the Knicks, they might've done that. I'm sure Pat Riley was a factor, but you get what I'm saying -- the team itself wasn't the end objective, the Wade-James-Bosh core was.  LeBron didn't join the Heat to challenge himself, or whatever /r/nba seems to think KD should've done instead. He was sick of losing every year, and he wanted to win. The circumstances are not the same, but it's a difference of degree, not kind. KD just did the same thing LeBron did, but in a less sympathetic way."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"I can't tell you exactly because there are many loopholes to bypass the salary cap but , basically like half of the rockets roster is only signed until this summer. If they would sign all of them except CP they have like 30 mil to offer James. James can also opt-in his player option with cleveland which is 35 milion and then demand a trade. **Long story short Rockets CAN sign LeBron**"

And in fact, I am upset we missed it because Malone couldn't figure out his lineups with Milsap, and the fact we paid 30M for a 33 year old.  This isn't even about the team, its about James Harden. Chris Paul led that team in the playoffs. Harden shot 40% and did the same predictible step back jumper.

"Boston Trades: Gordon Hayward   Cleveland Trades: Lebron James (either he opts in or a sign and trade)  Kyrie/Rozier   Brown / Smart  Tatum/?  James/Morris  Horford/ ?  They would need to get a back up big (Baynes? Monroe? Noel?) And they would have a shot at the chip. Boston may be good enough as is, but adding Lebron will improve those odds.  Cleveland might do it just to remain a playoff contender while they're stuck in cap hell, knowing Lebron is gone.  I don't think Boston can make it work capwise without including Irving/Hayward/Horford and i don't think you can package players together in a Marcus Smart sign and trade for Lebron.      "
"At some point Lebron made the decision that he was just going to finish every single shot regardless of contact. Coincidentally, that's when he became unstoppable. It's not ""I'm going to bait you into fouling me,"" it's ""you're going to foul me, and I'm going to score."" Harden never quite figured out the second part. He still relies completely on the refs being on his side. And because of how much he flops the refs look at him skeptically, especially in a long series where they probably just study *his* gametape to not get fooled by *his* tricks.  The result is as the playoffs went on he just didn't get as many bullshit calls. Which kills him because he'll waste an entire possession just to try to get a call. See Rockets Exhibit #6 above. It's a foul, sure. But it's not basketball. It's not a real shot attempt, he just tried to waste the possession getting fouled. The ref should have the right to not call that. Harden just makes it awkward for everybody. And somehow the *refs* get blamed for not giving Harden every call that he wants. Why can't they say ""fuck you James, not today."""
LeBron James?
"I mean the guys he's complaining don't get credit are Lue who has Lebron James and is literally winning because of Lebron James, Jason Kidd who had a noticeably awful defensive scheme, and Dwayne Casey who took years to finally wake up and say ""hey let me make a modern offense"" then gets destroyed by a Cavs team that almost got eliminated first round.

"The picks? Gordon?  Just curious, cause the picks are as much to get rid of Anderson than anything else. And the upside is taking Eric Gordon off your bench and adding LeBron James.  The vet min market would also be incredibly lucrative. "
"To paraphrase a Deadspin article written about LeBron James, this is how I felt watching Curry last night:  ""Oh, you're trying desperately to save your season?  That's cool.  I'm just gonna potato cannon this thing towards the basket. Or maybe just take 9 straight heat checks.  I dunno.  It just seems like it looks cool, maybe""  I like Steph a lot, and he seems like a decent dude.  But damn if he isn't a killer.  I swear he goes for those shots specifically just to fuck with the other team, and the crazy thing is he knows he can hit half of them."
"Daryl Morey is the last person to be afraid of the complicated.  If they trade for LeBron, there's only 3 teams involved. Really 2, since Gordon being re-routed to Indy is basically a separate deal. It does hinge on LeBron agreeing, which is the circumstance of this entire post, and by all means less farcical than ever.   There are no dominoes outside of that, only roadblocks if Chris Paul or Trevor Ariza agreeing to godfather deals to screw things up, which seems pretty unlikely. Capela signing a sheet quickly is the most possible, but can also be delayed for 3-4 days.  I also don't see how this is gutting their team. The picks going out are pretty identical to what Miami sent to Cleve after they got LeBron for the first time. And even if they don't do this deal, they face the *exact* same question with re-signing CP, so why wouldn't you A. maximize how good your team is if you keep him and B. give him all the reason in the world to take a friendlier/shorter deal? The deal comes down to Gordon and picks for LeBron James.  I just don't think any GM in the league could have a chance to get LeBron and all but guarantee a trip to the finals, and poo poo it over some complicated order of operations or what late first rounders they lose."

I’m saying for all the “end of a competitive league” nonsense, the warriors and heat have had 2 very similar first 2 years, with the major difference being the Heat lost the finals in year 1, which was largely due to LeBron James himself.

"LeBron James is playing phenomenal this year. GSW doesn't look like the same team, they don't look motivated. I'm going off the pattern that LBJ lost the first finals against GSW, then came back the next year and balled out to come back from 3-1 and then lost the next year 4-1 solely because KD was hungry! LBJ won't lose twice in a row in the finals. He's playing with a certain level of determination that's a tad bit intimidating. "

"Nothing of what I said is subjective. Laura Ingraham has a sordid history of racist (and homophobic and nationalistic) dogwhistling. It is well documented.

We won't even talk about the way she talked about the Parkland survivors because they have a different political opinion than her. She's a racist homophobic jingoist garbage can who makes the big bucks making elderly conservative white people who watch Fox News feel comfortable in their racism, homophobia, and nationalism. The words that came out of her mouth about LeBron James are entirely different than that the ones that came out of SAS'. Different context about different LeBron statements with different subtext and different intent. If you can't see that you really do need to stop it and get help.   Also, you literally just said that someone who has a different opinion than you is ""going into mental gymnastics"" just for having that opinion, where do you possibly get off talking about someone else's biases and incapability of having a conversation?"
"I'll revisit that statement if and when you get LeBron. Obviously that would change things considerably, but with his stated unwillingness to take a pay cut, it looks like it will be difficult to pay Harden, Paul, and James their market value."
"Not because ""THEY DONT LIKE IT"", but because ""THEY CANT RESPECT IT"".    Are you, as competitive and hard working person, seriously going to respect Kevin Durant,going to GSW just to win a title fast and easy ?    No you will not, you will not give him any credit because thats a pussy move.    In a same way, you will not give any credit to team that comes together to win a title fast and easy and then later disbands.    I can not put ""superteam"" on any scale because to consider a team great, you have to acknowledge their greatness, hard work and dedication to stay together and say ""we will win this, we will improve to win as a unit""  and as such, show respect.   **Looking at Dallas Mavericks 2010-11, I take my cap off to that team.**      **Sure, looking at it from angle ""who can beat Bulls team"", yea most of these todays teams might have some shot at beating Bulls and being considered ""super team"" in that way.**    But listen to this...   Even tho James Harden is MVP, I do not respect him at all for his playstyle.   No one is going to remember him with ""that guy worked hard, played hard, never cheated the game"" in a heart to heart conversation.   Everyone is going to say ""he always looked to draw foul, he played sneaky, flopped"".   Same way with these teams that form in a ""superteam"" way.    You know what Kobe once said in a ""PRE SEASON"" game  when asked ""Kobe its pre season, why are you playing""   Kobe said ""People pay their hard earned money to come watch us play, Imma play""    And then on other end you got Lebron who sits out games in mid season and flops.    Not a role model to follow and respect, same with these ""superteams"".  "
"Then I don't see consistency in your argument.  You're judging James Harden off basically 1 series against GSW (if you're saying he hasn't (proved his worth"") and seemingly lofting LeBron off 1 series against an injury riddled Boston team.  LeBron played phenomenal, but it's easier to perform when you're being guarded by Marcus Morris than Kevin Durant."
I believe that it does. James Harden was nowhere as efficient as the regular season. Lebron hit another gear and has been  amazing.
Haha Jesus Christ I wouldn't even be mad if I lived in a world where Grayson Allen had more rings than LeBron James 
"The scoreboard said otherwise.  And be more of a sore loser. It's a really good look.  You just can't admit your team lost because of the warriors defense was great in the 3rd and your team missed 27 in a row from the 3. Did the refs make you miss all those 3s? Lol.

This conversation was based around LeBron thinking about Phoenix as a realistic place to play, not whether or not Devin Booker is a good basketball player. Obviously Book projects to be a future all star. Do his future projections help 34 year old LeBron James next season more than other landing spots? No."
Watch it be Lebron James Jr. 
"&gt;everyone else is just salty they formed a team like this  I think the word ""formed"" is the key here. The Warriors were a phenomenal team and KD wanted in on the action. I get why he did it, but that is the difference in everyone's mind between what LeBron did and what KD did.   KD joined the warriors; LeBron built the Heat/Cavs.   KD could easily have more rings than James when this is all said and done, but that difference will be what sets them apart from a purely ""respect"" position (which let's be honest is important to these guys). "
"The word choke has lost all meaning.  It used to used when guys would screw up a routine play due to pressure (Nick Anderson missing 4 straight free throws to close out a game or a wide open receiver dropping a ball in the fourth quarter of a tight game).  Now it's thrown at every star whose team loses and who doesn't perform up to LeBron James standards.  If Harden tires out in the second half of games while running the offense solo against a very tough defense designed to stop him while also being targeted when he's on defense, it's choking because LeBron wouldn't have done it.  "
"It’s funny you mention him holding his hand up like he’d make it.   Many players have a really good idea of whether a shot is good or not, when it leaves their hand.   I don’t believe Lebron James has whatever that is. He often looks surprised when the ball falls. It’s fairly easily seen in last second shots. Every time he makes a buzzer beater or close to,  to win a game, he looks more surprised than anyone that it fell.   Same on misses though his reaction isn’t as clear. On 3’s he’ll stand there squirming as if his body can apply English to the ball. "

MVP is a regular season award why is that so hard to understand? An added mvp for playoffs would be shit because obviously you’re aiming for the finals and finals mvp. Also Lebron barely played defense all season so no he shouldn’t be. Doesn’t mean he isn’t the best player but it’s the least I’ve ever seen him play defense by a mile. James harden had a great season and second for mvp is Anthony Davis. 
"Wut???  James Harden is the MVP and LeBron is the best player, duh. MVP =/= Best player, and it shouldn't."
"What?! Did you even watch the Playoffs over the last 4 years?  In 2015 we had to go up against the DRose led Bulls who almost beat us if not for a miracle buzzer beater and the refs ignoring Blatt using a TO we didn't have. That Bulls team was legit. Also in 2015 we played a 60 win Atlanta Hawks team. They were the epitome of team basketball and just because we swept them doesn't mean they weren't a good team.    In 2016 we had to get through a 56 win Toronto Raptors team who had a ton of momentum behind them and actually had tied the series up 2-2. It was the way we finished out this series that ultimately gave the Raps their fear of LBJ and the Cavs, but for a brief minute it really looked like this team could've gotten through us.    In 2017 the Paul George led Pacers were NOT a bad team by any means. Yes we swept them, but the margin of victory was so RIDICULOUSLY small. In the first two games the cavs won by a combined total of 3 points. The fourth game of the series was also tight the entire game. Following the Pacers series we played lights out the rest of the way but I do think this was the easiest path of victory for the Cavs to the Finals out of all of their runs.    Finally, this year we just barely squeaked by a very physical Pacers team, took down the nearly 60 win Raptors team who had the deepest bench in the entire NBA, and then had to play against the #1 defensive team in the NBA.    The narrative that the East is weak is such bullshit or thinking LBJ didn't have to battle each year. The ONLY reason why people say the east is weak is BECAUSE of Lebron James. Superstars know the West is the tougher conference but keep moving west because nobody wants to play LBJ earlier in the playoffs than they have to. "
"&gt; ing h  I think Lebron should stay in the East because its good for his career. The East is garbage so it makes him stand out more. If he goes to a team in the West, he'll be another guy good at basketball not King James like he is in the East. The West teams are so much better and there are so many good players to compete that he would just blend in"
"Reminds me of Derozan last year, “ We would have won if we had Lebron James”"
"If the Spurs had Kawhi, they wouldn’t have been a 7 seed and the Warriors wouldn’t have played them in the first round. The Pelicans seemed to play better without Boogie and they swept the third seed so that argument isn’t really that good either. Chris Paul is 33 years old playing crazy minutes and does not have the physical attributes of someone like LeBron James. While his injury sucks, it’s not really “luck”, especially when you consider his injury history. And it’s not really their fault that the East sucks in comparison to the West. So I get that the Warriors had some good fortune but you can’t really call their ring “not impressive”. There have been plenty of other championship teams that have had less competition."
"Give me a job as a reporter    ""CAN YOU TELL ME IF YOUR TEAM WOULD HAVE HAD MORE OF A CHANCE OF WINNING THIS SERIES IF CHRIS PAUL HAD HAVE PLAYED?""   ""CAN YOU TELL ME IF YOUR TEAM WOULD HAVE HAD MORE OF A CHANCE OF WINNING THIS SERIES IF YOU MADE YOUR SHOTS?""   ""HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU DREAMED ABOUT MAKING IT TO THE FINALS AND HOW DOES IT FEEL TO NOT HAVE MADE IT?""   ""IF YOU COULD HAVE MADE YOUR SHOTS WOULD YOU HAD HAVE?""    ""WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO THE WARRIORS MOVING FORWARD? BTW THEY JUST BEAT YOU GUYS?""   ""ANY THOUGHTS ON LEBRON JAMES? I KNOW HES NOT ON YOUR TEAM BUT HES GOING TO PLAY AGAINST THE TEAM YOU JUST LOST TO""   ""WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU ARE GOING TO DO NOW THAT YOU LOST AND ARE OUT OF THE PLAYOFFS?""   ""IS KD A SNAKE?"""
"Only in this sub can we have a Game 7 where the underdog almost wins without one of their best players who is simultaneously one of the best PGs in the league, and still have people complaining that the sport is ruined. Houston seized to complain and bitch and said they’d try and beat them, and shit with CP3, might’ve. Hell, I know boogie can be toxic but NOLA could’ve been much more competitive with him and made that a better series.  The real issue is that the finals have been and will continue to be bad until some of the eastern conference front offices take their heads out of their asses. The only reason the East has won recently is because of LeBron James and the Cavs having a good enough roster that year. I think Boston, however will change this. "
There's also Lebron James Jr. and LBJ III in the same team
Your team is going to come out of the lebron James era with 1 chip. 
"I actually think it will be a good series between GSW and CAVS  Lebron james factor - refs not gona be so biased to GSW as James got the most fan by number - zaza / other clumsy centres cant intentionally injure lbj under such scrutiny  - lbj is the ultimate mismatch. in this aspect he surpassed mj / kobe, as he can play any position on court, lets face it, who doesn't play lbj in random position in 2k  but as dominant as lbj, it comes down to whether the supporting cast of CAVS - literally everyone besides james can get it done, whether the trade mid-season would pay off.   look forward to a good series."
"Usually if you are trying to compliment/highlight a player you say their name first followed by the team. LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers take on Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors. Saying it the opposite way sounds like the player is just a tag along, which is what I’m assuming he was trying to do here."
Bryan Colangelo will never land Lebron James. It’s a fact. 
My favorite team is Lebron James
"Have you seen plays where JR isos? It either leads to a contested miss or a turnover. I agree with more touches leads to more engagement and perhaps rhythm, but in the Cavs' case, you have Lebron James. Any possession is a good possession when you have him on your team."
"The truth is, Steph did play well in those 2015 finals. Yes, Iggy was critical in defending Lebron James and coming back from that 2-1 deficit to take it in 6, but it's ridiculous that Steph didn't get the FMVP. The man was the engine of GSW on offense and dropped 26 points per game on good efficiency."
Dwane Casey repeatedly having CJ Miles guard LeBron James  [LeBron even had something to say about it](https://streamable.com/qw447)
But wouldn’t lebron James 2011 finals be up there too? Just asking 
"This take is perfect. You say ""LeBron James is good enough to steal the NBA Finals"", and if the Cavs lose, you just say, ""ya, well, he was good enough but his team didn't pull through"".  But if he does win... then oh boy, you get to point to your sbnation post and tell everyone that you saw it coming. "
"'04 Memphis would have had Lebron, Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, Mike Miller, Jason Williams \(White Chocolate\), James Posey, Stromile Swift \(who I know kind of sucked but boy could he dunk\), and Hubie Brown as the coach."
"Because LeBron holds the ball majority of the shot clock like James Harden, then passes the ball with 6 seconds left and expects the 3 point shooters on the team to be able to make a shot. They aren’t in rhythm. "
"I mean that's not wrong but that's like saying ""Well LeBron James over Kyle Korver isnt always true because if I need a 3 pointer I'm taking Korver""  Sure it's true but it doesn't mean Irving over Nash isn't ridiculous."
Some guy I worked with is convinced James Worthy is better than Lebron James... I had to leave the room before I did something stupid
LeBron James is better than Michael Jordan
"‘He’s probably the No. 1 smartest basketball player and person I’ve been around,’ said Heat forward LeBron James. ‘He knows everything.’ ([2012](https://www.slamonline.com/uncategorized/lebron-james-shane-battier-the-smartest-player-and-person-in-basketball/))"
"They lost one game, away, in OT, on the back of a top 5 all time single player performance from Lebron James for the finals. It was like the 2nd highest individual gamescore all time in a Finals game. "
"Other than tristan and mozgov he was literally the best shooter on the floor for them % wise. Nobody was making anything, it would be worse to let other perimter guys take those shots.   it's complete nonsense to say that Lebron shot them out of those finals, there was no one else to shoot. Shumpert shot the best 3% and he shot a FG% of 25%. JR and Delly shot 3's under 30%, and shot 32% and 28% FG overall. James Jones shot barely 30% from 3, and shot 32% from the floor."

"If LeBron James, the season after declaring that he'd win ""not one, not two"" and so on, and joining Wade and Bosh in their primes, lost to an Oklahoma City Thunder team whose 3 main players were all under 23, his legacy would've taken an absolute nosedive. You're basically grading Durant, Harden, and Westbrook by the players they've become compared to the players they were then.   Him losing to a team led by Dirk that went on an absolute tear by eliminating the Roy/Aldridge Blazers, the two-time defending NBA champions (and up to that point, 3-time defending Western Conference champions) Lakers with Kobe and Gasol, and the aforementioned Thunder, is far better for his legacy than if he lost to the 2011 Thunder."
"Look I answered your question:  &gt; Is Jordan not on the list because he got destroyed in the first round multiple times  As you can see Jordan is #5, if you look above him at #4, Larry Bird destroyed Michael Jordan in the playoffs.  In fact the United Center should but a leprechaun statue in the front because as a franchise, the Chicago Bulls never beat the Boston Celtics in the playoffs.  Now since you cannot answer my question, I will answer it for you.  LeBron James got swept a 2nd time because Tim Duncan is a greater basketball player than LeBron James.  Which coincides with my original comment, I would pick Tim Duncan over LeBron James"
I remember when Tyreke Evans was considered the free trial version of Lebron James
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green."
"It’s only a meme to insecure fans Lmao all star appearances? I’m not talking about life time achievement awards. You included Ray Allen’s 10 ASG appearances when he joined Miami in the last two years of his career.  All nba is a far better measure of team mates. The only all nba team mate LeBron had in his second stint in Cleveland was Kyrie Irving and he was on the 3rd team. The time before that was in 2012-2013 where wade was all nba, but again he was 3rd team twice, and 2nd team once.   Jordan on the other hand, had Scottie who made 2nd team in 92 and 97, 3rd team in 93 and 98, and made 1st team in 94, 95, 96.  All of this and I didn’t even look at the all nba defensive teammates Jordan and LeBron had lol  When did shaq make the all star team when he was with LeBron? Lmao this is exactly why it’s dumb AF to look at all star appearances. Y’all try to push a narrative that shaq and Ray Allen were all star players with LeBron.   1) Jordan was a better scorer. Sure I can agree with that, but LeBron will reach Jordan’s all time points on less shots because LeBron is a more efficient scorer. And in the post season, LeBron has already shattered Jordan’s point total in less shots.   Scoring much easier? Lol okay man. It’s not like the 3 ball didn’t exist when Jordan played.   2) Jordan played in a far superior era - lol I disagree. Defense might have been better, but the teams were not better. Jordan didn’t go up against team back then stacks up to the warriors of the last 3 years. Back then, east teams were making the playoffs with horrible records. It was an expansion league. Jordan made the playoffs with 30 and 38 win teams lmao   3) LeBron is the far better playmaker than Jordan. Comparing their usage to their assists is not even close really. This coupled with LeBron being a more efficient player than Jordan puts LeBron ahead. LeBron is arguably the greatest passer we’ve ever seen.   4) when Jordan leaves, they go from 57 wins to 55 wins and are a blown call away from ECF. LeBron leaves and Cleveland goes on the longest losing streak of all time and have the worst record in the league. LeBron leaves Miami, and after 4 straight finals, they go to missing the playoffs completely.   &gt;	LeBron James allows his opponents to increase their scoring averages in the Finals (see Tony Parker in 2007, Jason Terry in 2011, Kevin Durant in 2012, and Andre Iguodoloa in 2015)  That’s one of the dumbest things I’ve read on here. Lebrons work load is far greater than Jordan’s on offense. And LeBron doesn’t have all nba defense players like Pippen and then a defensive player of the year defender in Rodman to back him up.   5) “LeBron would have had a much harder time playing in Jordan’s era” this is also incorrect. LeBron would be just as, if not, more dominant in Jordan’s era. All that and he’s a better long range shooter and a far superior passer than Jordan makes him even more dangerous in that era.   6) “LeBron has his moments, but he just doesn’t have the mojo in most big games”. This just reeks of you not having a clue what you are talking about. He has the most game winners in playoff history. He also has the best elimination game numbers in nba history. He also has the best game 7 numbers in nba history. He also has arguably the best clutch numbers in the playoffs as well  7) “Michael Jordan shows up in the 4th quarter while LeBron James disappears.”   HAHAHA. okay now it is absolutely clear that you haven’t watched basketball since 2011. Where was Jordan when he was getting swept in the first round multiple times? Common man, you need to come to 2018 and re-evaluate your stuff. "
Can I reuse players? If so:  Steph Curry  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Anthony Davis
&gt; I believe playing alongside LeBron made both Bosh  I REALLY disagree with that. Bosh was on his way to being a top player and was basically there before joining James. He had everything in his game already and he would have looked like a much better player if he had never left Toronto because he wouldnt have been third fiddle to James and Wade. He worked on his defensive game but I strongly believe that was not because James made him better.
"&gt;Bosh changed one thing about his game and that was just shooting more 3s. Just about every other stat went down, but he also got injured a couple of times. Still, Pat Riley and Spo had a system that even Lebron couldn't fuck up since Pat is about loyalty.  What does that even mean? Just about every stat went down? Obviously a guy who is suddenly the 3rd option on offense is gonna have the ball less and score less ppg. That's not anything surprising. And Bosh did have to make the biggest sacrifice out of all of them to remodel his game so it definitely took him a while to adjust. Basically once he played small ball 5 he made huge leaps. Offensively Bosh made his biggest strides from 2012 to 2014. Shooting 50% from midrange for a whole season!! That's Dirk levels which was an insane jump from his usual 42 to 45%. And obviously that 3 point shot. I'm not sure if he had added that to his game without the ""LeBron system"". He also became one of the elite PnR defenders of the league in his Miami years, and I'm not sure how much of that is because of LeBron's absurd defensive ability back then. I remember plenty of Zach Lowe Grantland articles about their insane blitzing defense and LeBron was definitely in a ""covering up mistakes"" role. Regarding this tangent:  [I always like to bring up this article from the beginnings of player tracking in the NBA.](http://grantland.com/features/the-toronto-raptors-sportvu-cameras-nba-analytical-revolution/) The Raptors created a system to generate ""player ghosts"" to show the optimal movements on the court as opposed to what the players actually did.   *""Ultra-aggressive help defense is really hard work. Replay that clip and watch how far DeRozan’s ghost has to move as the Knicks swing the ball. That’s brutal, and it’s not a coincidence that the only team that consistently mirrors the help defense of its ghosts is Miami, Rucker says. The Heat have three of the best wing defenders in the league in Shane Battier, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade, and the latter two are among the NBA’s most gifted pure athletes.* **James can mimic DeRozan’s hyperactive ghost in a way no other player can, Rucker says. “LeBron basically messes up the system and the ghosts,” Rucker says. “He does things that are just unsustainable for most players.”***""*  It's a fantastic read overall. And I stick to my point that Bosh became a far better basketball player in Miami than he was before.   &gt;The thing is, Wade was and still is not that fucking old and throughout the seasons with Lebron he showed he was still a superstar in the league. There were many many times when you could tell he was still the captain of the team.  Are you strictly talking about 2011? Because after that it was definitely ""LeBron's team"". Not even really a debate. Wade started breaking down more heavily by the 2012 playoffs and especially after the Heat win streak in 2013. In 2014 he was moving like a 37 year old at times.   &gt;Richard Jefferson, Shane Battier, and Mike Miller already had established themselves as good players in the league. Lebron didn't make them better as much as he just provided a spot light for them. Mike Miller was always a 3 point specialist and for a while at Memphis he was the guy. RJ was successful everywhere he went (except San Antonio) and Shane was an extremely established defensive veteran. Lebron deserves absolutely no credit for these guys.  This is probably my biggest disagreement with your post. Both Battier and Jefferson were on their last legs in the league , being traded and basically with their dying breaths on the court. They absolutely had career revivals and played major roles in their teams championship runs. Mike Miller began playing with LeBron coming off of major injuries. That he became a vital role player on a back to back champion is a small miracle imo, definitely couldn't have done so if he had to play like he used to.   Other guys who fits exactly into this mold are Channing Frye, Chris Andersen. Both of them got their career revitalized playing with LeBron.   &gt;Delladova was a great player in his own right too. Not until he got more minutes did he start doing extremely well. *In his first season after his trade his numbers were just about identical to his numbers in Cleveland. He was also pretty defensive minded.*  Well that's just not true. His advanced stats are all **significantly** worse through the board.   &gt;Norris Cole was another rookie who actually did better after he left Miami for 2 seasons, right now it looks like his stats have dropped significantly at OKC, though.   How? I mean how do you come to that conclusion? He got traded, moved to the next team and then played like 110 games over 3 years and was out of the league after that. LeBron made Norris Cole look like an NBA caliber player. (more or less, he already looked terrible back then)  "
"All players whine to an extent. Some players whine more. Like someone mentioned, follow any one player closely, and the whining, complaining, contorted faces will come with nearly every perceived injustice with nearly every single player. Additionally, as other people have mentioned, Lebron gets hacked more than most players I’ve seen but keeps going because he’s so strong, this leading to the perception that he wasn’t actually fouled. I mean, look at the foul Morris made on him driving to the lane at the end of the Boston series. Morris is not a small person. Who in the league can make the move that James made? I would argue maybe one or two? I don’t think anyone on the Warriors finishes that and-1. So combine that with being scrutinized, and, probably to an extent, the mental fatigue of carrying his team quite often, and you can begin to get a clearer sense of why he does it.   I don’t like it. I was always taught to shut up and play. But I’m also, or at least try to be, and empathetic person. "
"some times it's a bit much - esp when he doesn't get back on defense to complain to refs. but that said, other than maybe Shaq, i've never seen a player in the NBA get hit/slapped/bumped/pushed so many damn times with the refs not blowing a whistle. it's what happens when you're as strong and dominant and Lebron, but it's not fair to Lebron. Unfortunately, it does get really frustrating for him and it boils over but he has to keep up the pressure on the refs.  also - this is lebron james complaining to refs, not fucking chris paul or blake griffin. dude has earned the right to complain with calls he doesn't agree with, especially the way he's playing this year."
so basically Lebron james is taking shots away from his teammates?  
Umm no he wasn’t lmao.  Dirk was Finals MVP in 2011. But I’d imagine you’re talking 2012 when Lebron James won finals MVP...   Better luck next time.
"Such an uninformed comment. Bosh sacrificed a few shots per game because he got LeBron James and Dwyane Wade on his team, learned how to be a great defender, started stretching the floor, and won 2 championships  Bosh made the All NBA 2nd team once, in 2007, so he played 3 more seasons in Toronto after that before leaving. So implying LeBron caused him to stop being an All NBA player is nonsense  Kevin Love has declined. He is just worse now, due to injuries and possibly other factors. He's still good, he just peaked in Minnesota when he was the #1 option. Again, he had 2 better scorers in front of him"
imagine spending your life hating lebron james so much that you take time to write shit like this
"The Jordan has more help meme lol.  Who besides Pippen and maybe Rodman are all NBA teammates? I can name about 4 or so for LeBron.  [Weird](http://i.magaimg.net/img/3g1n.png)  Wade had 12 ASG appearances.  Bosh had 11 ASG appearances.  Ray Allen had 10 ASG appearances.  In comparison Pippen made 7, Grant made 1.  I didn't even include Shaq, Antawn Jamison, Mo Williams, Larry Hughes, Varajao, Ilgauskas, Love or Kyrie lol.  Jordan played with literal who's until he made Pippen into what he was.  &gt;lebron is still playing in the league  And **still** losing Finals series lol.  **(1) Jordan was a better scorer than LeBron James**  Scoring Titles – Jordan – 10, LeBron -1  Jordan has averaged over 40 points per game in an NBA record five playoff series (and nearly pulled it off against Cleveland in 1989). LeBron has zero. In fact, LeBron has four series where he shot less than 40% for the series (Jordan has 1).  Jordan also accomplished this before rule changes came along to make scoring much easier, yet still fared well at age 38 in that era  **2) Jordan played in a far superior era**  The 1980’s and 1990’s were a much tougher era. Defense was better and teams were better. The 1990’s had the most teams that won 50 or 60 games in NBA history for a decade.  Despite that, Jordan’s Bulls defeated seven 60+ win teams (a record for a dynasty team in a decade) and 20 teams that had between 50-59 wins.  27 of the 37 playoff opponents Jordan faced had over 50 wins, while 18 of LeBron’s opponents (out of 37) had under 50 wins. Jordan was guarded by DPOY players in the playoffs several times – Sidney Moncrief, Alvin Robertson, Dennis Rodman and Gary Payton. (Rodman four times).    **3) Michael Jordan is a far superior defender than LeBron James**  All-Defense First Team – Jordan nine times, James 5 times  Steals Titles – Jordan three time winner, James zero times  Jordan won the 1988 DPOY during a time where it was much more difficult to win that award due to the amount of great defenders. Jordan played great defense in all six of his NBA Finals appearances.  LeBron James allows his opponents to increase their scoring averages in the Finals (see Tony Parker in 2007, Jason Terry in 2011, Kevin Durant in 2012, and Andre Iguodoloa in 2015)  This really isn’t close. Jordan locked down his opponents, James can't.  **4) LeBron James is a turnover machine while Jordan took care of the ball**  LeBron James turns the ball over way too many times at critical junctures in games. He has two playoff games with 10 turnovers and has 177 turnovers in the Finals compared to 99 for Michael Jordan.  LeBron James led both teams in turnovers in 2017 (22), 2016 (31), 2014 (19), and 2011 (24). He was his team’s turnover leader every time except in 2012.  **5) You can count on Michael Jordan to close games**  Here’s [a list](http://www.nba.com/jordan/game_winners.html) of game-winners from Michael Jordan. He repeatedly came up huge to close out a game, even in the playoffs and Finals.  ""The Shot” and “The Shot II” both against Cleveland to knock them out of the postseason, the game-winner over Dennis Rodman in Game 3 of the 1989 East Finals, the tying shot to force overtime over Vlade Divac in Game 3 of the 1991 Finals, his heroics in the 1997 Finals and the series winner in Game 6 of the 1998 Finals.  LeBron has his moments, but he just doesn’t have the mojo in most big games. He is 0-5 in the Finals to tie or win the game and according to ESPN, he is 5 for 47 to tie or win the game in the final five seconds of the game.  **6) LeBron would have had a much harder time playing in Jordan’s era**  He is physically gifted but plays lousy competition in the East and essentially receives a free pass to the Finals each year as his hand-picked teams are loaded with talent.  In the 80’s or 90’s, teams like the Knicks and Pistons would have beaten him down and he does not handle physical play very well.  **7) Michael Jordan never got outscored by a player on the bench in the Finals**  Jordan showed up for all six of his Finals appearances. LeBron got outscored by Jason Terry (who played way less minutes per game).  Don’t forget about the way Kawhi Leonard outplayed LeBron in 3 straight games in 2014 Finals. Check out the numbers in Games 3, 4, and 5. You’d never see that from Jordan.  **8) LeBron James has never had to defeat three teams with 50 wins or two teams with 60 wins in any playoff run**  Jordan’s teams accomplished this in 5 of his 6 playoff runs.  **9) Michael Jordan never claimed to be the best player in the world before an elimination game and then shot terrible to lose the game.**  LeBron James told everyone he’s the best player in the world and then shot 13-32 in Game 6 against the Warriors. Lol.  **10) LeBron James is a Flopper**  [Flopping](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4fSlLdXNzPw#) is why many fans who grew up watching the NBA in the 1970’s, 1980’s and 1990’s have limited respect for today’s game and LeBron James is one of the best actors ever, which annoys people.**  **11) Michael Jordan shows up in the 4th quarter while LeBron James disappears.**  Jordan kept his teams in the game, especially when it got tough and scored most of his points in the 2nd half and 4th quarter. LeBron goes 2-12 in the 4th of the 2011 Finals for 6 points.  In 2014 he was completely outplayed when it really mattered, but to his credit, he did score alot of points after his team was getting blown out by more than 15.  (In Games 3,4,and 5, he scored 51 of his 81 points when down 15 or more lol)  Edit:  I almost forgot the most argument ending stat of all time.  #**JORDAN WAS NEVER PHOTOGRAPHED CARRYING A PURSE IN AN ALFALFA FROM THE LIL RASCALS LOOKIN ASS SUIT WITH SHORTS**"
"There is a difference where you as a team help to break down the defensive and after a few extra passes get the open look, and there is Lebron James where he can create an open look from nothing just by driving to the lane because he demands the extra attention from the defending teams.  For an example, if you're the Nets who is going to create that extra space, help to break down the defensive if you don't have a player like Lebron James? Great ball movement, good sets, and the right pass will do that, but it requires perfect execution, or you can have Lebron James and then you only need decent ball movement, some sets, and the right pass just from Lebron James to achieve that. Look at any good offensive team in the league and every team has that kinda player (Rockets - James Harden and CP3; Warriors - Durant, Curry, Klay when he gets hot; Blazers - Lillard; Pelicans - Davis....)."
I think Lebron is just as good as James
I have better headphones than LeBron James 😊😚
"I didn’t, but then LeBron James happened. "
russ isn’t lebron james
"I don't think I have it backwards at all. LeBron James has monopolized the ball his entire career, even when he's had great teammates, because that is the only way he can be his best self. When he has to sacrifice the ball to allow others to play to up to their potential, it hurts his stats, and he tends to fade away from the game. This was made evident in Miami's 2011 finals loss to the Mavericks, where LBJ was a shell of himself due to having to share the spotlight with D-Wade, who put up a FMVP quality performance. After that season, to correct the issue, D-Wade publicly and willingly took a step back, calling it LBJ's team. Only then was LeBron able to be his best self.   Now, imagine that were the Warriors. And Steph or KD could only play to up to their potential by one having to step back, allowing the other to monopolize the ball/lead the team in an effort to avoid upsetting ego's? Their willingness to sacrifice their individual star and share the spotlight absent of ego's is why their on the cusp of creating the next NBA dynasty. For me, that is more important than stuffing a stat sheet.  "
"Here's my top 10:  1. Kobe   2. Kareem  3. Magic  4. Larry  5. Michael Jeffrey Jordan  6. Bill  7. Wilt  8. Shaq  9. Tim Duncan  10. LeBron James  If I recall, the 2nd time he got swept, Tim Duncan embarrassed him twice on Miami's home court.  My question to you is, why did he get swept a 2nd time"
"Anyone who understands the basics of basketball recognizes that players that play the way LeBron do seldom win anything. If collecting stats were the ultimate determiner of greatness, then Wilt would the GOAT. But, he isn't, because the objective of basketball isn't to see who's best at filling a stat shit, but who's best at winning. LeBron James isn't that, and never has been. "
"&gt; It's not the same pressure though.  I disagree, as I think your first playoff series is always going to be ridiculously stressful, this isn't an argument I'm going to bother getting into.  As I've said, it's probably a part of it, but I don't think it's *just* the pressure being higher.    Just to be clear, are you saying that you think it's just the pressure, and that there are no other contributing factors?    &gt;It's clear that Hood is not cut from the same cloth physically or mentally.  I mean... being as physically / mentally strong as Lebron freaking James is kind of a ridiculously high standard to set.    &gt;Plus the Cavs are expected to contend for the title. The Jazz haven't had that pressure for a long time and won't for the foreseeable future.   Was that little shot at the team I support really necessary?  "

"Lebron James is a Top 2 all time player but they’re now playing against much, much tougher conditions than the regular season - better teams, higher intensity/effort, etc"
"Oh yeah, 28/7/5 on 56&amp;#37; TS in the playoffs James Harden \- got to stay away from that guy, LeBron needs to stick with Jeff Green, Jordan Clarkson, and George Hill instead."
"Richard Jefferson had a great interview segment on Undisputed where he said playing with LeBron is ""Not for everyone"" and I thought that was incredibly astute. Playing with LeBron undoubtedly gives you opportunities to excel in moments, but that doesn't mean it's always easy for anyone.  LeBron has had a lot of teammates in his career so I think isolating only the new players this season to try to answer this question is just willfully disregarding the rest of his career. Isolating those four new guys is cherry picking a small and volatile sample size (post-trade deadline regular season + playoff run)  If you want to break it down, you should stat with other all-star caliber players: Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love. Playing with LeBron as a star player is obviously not an easy thing. You have to take a back seat whether you like it or not, and it seems only his best friend Dwyane Wade was able to cope with that from a mental standpoint, the other three guys all struggled. On the court, I believe playing alongside LeBron made both Bosh and Irving much better players than before playing with him. Part of that growth is the necessity that they must expand their own games to continue to have a large impact on the game. Wade did not become a better player, but his career was on a down-turn that the other three guys weren't on, so it remains to be seen whether it was more age and attrition rather than playing alongside LeBron.  But while the data on other impact players is a mixed bag, his track record with role players is pretty sterling. If you go all the way back to 2006, the first time LeBron entered the MVP conversation, and you can already see names like Damon Jones and Anderson Varejao, who made their careers early out of playing alongside LeBron. Larry Hughes was never the same guy in Washington that he was in Cleveland, but it is worth acknowledging that his contract with Cleveland was his huge payday in a time when guys played awesome in contract years and then were never the same after securing that 5-6 year deals (Side note: This is why contract lengths were shortened in 2011 CBA).  As you get to the 2009 Cavs you start to see more names like Mo Williams, Delonte West and Daniel Gibson, and an entire team of more-or-less scrubs who won 66 games. That's more than Houston won this year! Mo Williams in particular received an all-star selection in 2009, his 3-point percentage going up 5 percentage points from his previous season in Milwaukee.    If there was one player from this later Cavs era that perhaps was worse alongside LeBron was Antawn Jamison, who was traded to Cleveland at the trade deadline in 2010, but statistically it just looks like he lost 3.5 shots a game from when he was in Washington, but his FG% went up 3.5 percentage points as well.   Miami is riddled with guys who have greater legacies because of LeBron: Mike Miller, Shane Battier, James Jones, Mario Chalmers, Norris Cole, Birdman. I couldn't find a single role player that I thought was made to be less than themselves during that entire four-year stint in Miami. Happy to hear from someone else that might know better.  The 2nd stint in Cleveland has been very similar to Miami if you ask me: Matthew Dellavadova, JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Iman Shumpert, Channing Frye, Richard Jefferson.  There's definitely a theme to a lot of these guys that excel around LeBron: They're older veteran players who have made their money already for the most part. They don't have alternative goals anymore outside of winning games and playing good team basketball (around LeBron). This is not to say the other guys don't want to win or play good team basketball, but many of them are young enough to still have personal career goals.   Edit: A lot of people discrediting what Bosh added to his game defensively while in Miami. He went from being referred to as ""The Ru Paul of big men"" by Shaq, to being one of the pioneers of bigs both switching and trapping high on the pick and roll. He defined a smothering heat defense that only worked because of his commitment to their principles. It allowed that defense to be as great as it was in forcing turnovers and creating pressure.  "
"We live a timeline where Hawks fans can make fun of an MVP that lost in 7 to a team with 4 all stars. You and everyone that upvoted you, are going to get what they deserve. Summer of LeBron James Harden."
For sure. We're going to be hearing about Lebron James for a long long time. 
"He makes his TEAM better, but not all of his teammates. The problem is that Lebron is the system, and in any like system, you need certain parts of it properly to work.   We know what kinda players do excel playing with Lebron, shooters (from Sasha Pavlovic, Daniel Gibson, Wally Szczerbiak, Damon Jones, Marshall to Mike Miller, James Jones, Eddie House, Mario Chalmers, Ray Allen back to JR Smith, Jefferson, Frye), because their only job is to defend as well as they can, and just hit the open shot when Lebron creates.   Also Lebron needs a secondary ball handler who can create for himself, and just make system less obvious with him (Mo Williams was decent in his prime with Lebron, but he was nowhere the same level as Wade in Miami, or Kyrie back in Clevland, and also people forget the failure of Larry Hughes).  Any limited defenders, rebounders who's limited offensive capabilities would get exposed on lesser teams. Players like Eric Snow, Varejao, Joe Smith, Ben Wallace to Haslem, Joel Anthony, Shane Battier, Chris Andersen back to Tristan Thompson, Shumpert.  We see the same trend we have seen in the past 20 years. Most championship or contender teams (Hakeem and Drexler, MJ and Pippen, Shaq and Kobe, Wade and Shaq, Duncan and Robinson, Kobe and Gasol) you can get away by only having 2 major offensive threats if you put enough defenders, shooters and hustle players around them. "
"&gt;On the other hand, stars get relegated with James on their team. Chris Bosh and Kevin Love are prime examples, where they were both basically turned into glorified 3pt shooters. The wide skillset of these players didn't factor into what LeBron('s coaches) had in mind for the game plan and so they're not given the freedom that allowed them to become stars in the first place.   Anyone who claims this simply didn't watch a second of Chris Bosh in Miami. Sure he got less touches than when he was the first option but that should be **obvious**. Bosh was used extensively around the high post for midrange jumpers and was always sought out to exploit mismatches in the low post with his fade-aways. He even got plenty of opportunities to use his drive game because bigs could never really keep up with him. Then he went on to extend his range and even became a 3 point shooter. Bosh absolutely thrived in the Miami system, improving his TS% pretty much every year and he made huge jumps on the defensive end.   As for Love, the dude still gets plenty of post touches (he's just not as good as he used too in converting them) and one of the Cavs' most dangerous sets revolves around his skillset.   The Heat should have probably won one more championship than they did but we all know how 2011 ended, by 14 though most of their role players including Wade were simply broken down.   If the Cavs hadn't run into arguably the greatest team of all time in 3/4 finals they likely would have been more successful as well. Too bad their ""raw talent"" wanted to be the man on his own team. Otherwise I'm not too sure what you're talking about with the huge amount of talent. "
"Yes, you're really grasping at straws here. The idea Philly makes this trade 100/100 times if they win a title with him might be true, but only from the standpoint that you may not want to risk anything knowing you had won a title. If they could undo the trade right now they would do that. If they could see their future , as you suggested, with Tatum or Fultz, they would probably undo the trade.   I see no reason why Tatum would mean no Lebron. Everyone wants Lebron, it's a question of whether he wants to play for you. Speculating they may not pursue James is really trying your hardest to invent fantasy scenarios in which this works for both sides. That's a crazy idea which isn't based in reality.   Tatum could fall off a cliff, but this shouldn't be how you judge trades. Nor should Fultz becoming a role player lead you to believe the trade is a win-win. They would still be better off with the better player and the pick if Fultz doesn't become better than Tatum. "
"They'd def keep CP3. If they had to let Capela go in order to get James, they'd do it imo. You still have Nene who is a serviceable backup C. And there are decent bigs available in FA this year. You could find a good fit for sure. If they get LeBron they are on par with Golden State. Possibly better."
"I think he makes the average player better, but star players worse.  LeBron('s coaches) seems to be great at figuring out specific roles for players on a team built entirely around LeBron. With average players, that can be really beneficial because they generally are either specialists already or they don't have a wide enough skillset to warrant larger roles and they can focus and excel in one area.  On the other hand, stars get relegated with James on their team. Chris Bosh and Kevin Love are prime examples, where they were both basically turned into glorified 3pt shooters. The wide skillset of these players didn't factor into what LeBron('s coaches) had in mind for the game plan and so they're not given the freedom that allowed them to become stars in the first place.   I think that this is actually detrimental to the team despite James' Finals streak. The Heat's 2/4 championships was underperformance in my opinion, and the Cavs had (and still have) a huge amount of raw talent that I feel they never fully took advantage of. "
"Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Lebron James, Scottie Pippen, Damian Lillard."
"People in Memphis will fight you if they know you said those things about Zach Randolph lol. He had a complete image change once he became the grandfather.   I’d say Dwight Howard is a good example of bad chemistry also, in 2009 he was in the finals with the magic, by 2011 he wanted out, by 2018 he’s on his 4th team in 5 years.  He’s been described as a ‘locker room fart’ by former teammates   For good chemistry Jon Salley for the pistons in the 80s was known as a great locker room guy.  Lebron James kept James Jones by his side all these years because he was a ‘locker room leader’  And now guys like Kendrick Perkins and David west have jobs mostly for locker room stuff "
"Put in younger Lebron James when he played exceptional defense, the warriors would have a problem being smothered by Kobe &amp; James."
"He is an unrestricted free agent so if youcan  re sign lebron and unliad some contracts it is a possibility. Guys like Ellington should seek out playing with Sslasher type players like Lebron, Jimmy Butler, Demar Derozan, James Harden etc. It makes them more valuable."

"Yep, I was not particularly fond of the NBA's Iso shot chucking era. That's why, even though I should have despised him on account of being drafted by my team's inter-division rival, I actually lauded LeBron James' arrival in 2003. He was the first emerging wing scoring superstar I'd seen in years who seemed to fully understand that being *The Man* didn't mean isolating for 20 seconds so he could shoot a contested mid-range fallaway every trip down the floor. [His first Nike commercial spoke to that aspect wonderfully.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeLaCjNRlyA)  I remember one of the biggest controversies of LeBron's career back then was the debate between whether he was wrong for passing out of a double team to find an open teammate for a potential game-winning shot (I think there were situations involving both Damon Jones and Donyell Marshall). I thought that was the sign of how wack parts of the game had become, where it was considered a flaw if a star player *didn't* shoot difficult shots over triple teams. Granted, I've oversimplifying the issue (some felt James was sometimes passing up clean looks) but broadly speaking, I commend James for, in part, changing our expectations of what's expected out of our modern superstars as a whole. "
"I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but...  I don't think you're as good at basketball as LeBron James is.  He's probably just a lil' better.  "
"Look, I love Steph. I loved him more than LeBron prior to this incredible run during this postseason. There is no star that is more relatable in sports than Steph Curry in my opinion. That being said, if we are being honest even in the 2015 finals he won WITHOUT Durant, he was not the Finals MVP.   In 2015, Curry averaged 26-5-6 shooting 44% from the field and 39% from three. This isn’t bad at all and I hate the narrative that Steph “didn’t show up” in the first finals. This is a good stat line. However, when you compare it to LeBron’s 36-13-9 on 38% from the field and (admittedly not good) 31% from three, it just doesn’t really stack up when you consider what LeBron had to play with.   I shouldn’t even need to bring up 2016 but I will to bolster the argument. That same “greatest of all-time” 73-9 team that Steph was the unanimous MVP of (rightfully so) gave up 30-11-9 to LeBron. He also shot 49% from the field and 37% from 3. Steph, on the other hand, averaged 23-5-4 on 40% shooting and 40% shooting from three. Would he have even won MVP if they won that series? I honestly think Draymond would have.   Now we get to 2017 and people do not even know whether Steph is the most valuable on his team anymore. I don’t know  how someone can be more valuable than LeBron James if people are questioning whether he is even more valuable than KD. Personally, I think Steph is more valuable than KD, but some people think it is a discussion. That being said, Curry averaged 27-8-9 on 44% shooting and 39% from 3. This is a tremendous stat line, but as we all know, he was one upped by KD who averaged 35-8-5 on 56% shooting and 47% from three. LeBron only averaged 34-12-10 on 56% shooting and 39% from three. Again, Curry was not Finals MVP.   This 2018 series has started out promising for him. He was phenomenal in game 1 but LeBron was still better and more valuable to his team. Outside of LeBron, the rest of the Cavs combined for 61 points while the Warriors, outside of Steph,  put up 95. LeBron would have a really solid case for MVP if they steal 2 games.   Also, if we are going to say that Cleveland management blew everything up anyways, then we have to give credit to Golden State’s management in building a great team around Curry. Remember, it wasn’t until they added Steve Kerr that they really took off.  LeBron made Cleveland what it is. I am not even talking about just basketball, but the city in general. That is next level.    TLDR: LeBron has pretty much outperformed Curry in every single finals and will likely do so again. The city of Cleveland is literally an afterthought without LeBron James. If you switch LeBron with Steph, the Cavs are a lottery team and the Warriors are relatively the same. "

Agreed.  Magic is like Ben Simmons in this era.  Larry is like a combination of LeBron James and Steph Curry.

"Can some LeBron James historian come in here and breakdown the lore of his life? Because somewhere along the way James did a misstep an accrued the wrath of an ancient and spiteful God. I don't know how, and I don't know when, but that is the only explanation. After realizing this, I decided to take a step back and uncover the bigger picture.  #Evidence  My strongest piece of evidence, and my first real lead, is a visual analysis of the three men in question:  [Sisyphus](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cd/57/be/cd57be641026af9993f0d88ee378b033--oil-canvas-l-art.jpg)  [Prometheus](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/-the-torture-of-prometheus-giovacchino-assereto.jpg)  [And lastly, King James](https://07.imgmini.eastday.com/mobile/20180601/20180601134536_5972f4edcf3c4b044ea5b13a1efac124_1.jpeg)   The first thing you might notice is the similar look in the faces of these men. The despair, the pain, the anguish. Here are a couple of composite images to reinforce this point.  [Composite 1:](https://i.imgur.com/IXP8ftz.png) Here you can see a closeup of each face together, note that you're looking at essentially the same person in all three.   [Composite 2:](https://i.imgur.com/fcPLqwZ.png) Here what you see is the root cause of each man's pain and suffering, isolated into one image. You have the boulder's intense weight crushing Sisyphus, forced to eternally carry it. You have the sharp talons and beak of the Eagle, stabbing at Prometheus and tearing out his flesh. For James you have a hybrid of the two, having to carry the large weight of Smith on his back while simultaneously being stabbed in *the same back* by him.  #The History  What I *couldn't* understand though, for the life of me, is why LeBron has been doomed to this merciless existence. In order to get a clearer understanding, let's breakdown the crimes of one Sisyphus, and one Prometheus.   [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus), similar to James in that he was a King, was punished by the Greek God's for his arrogance and trickery. Sisyphus first started off by betraying the trust of Zeus, as he revealed information that Zeus wanted to keep hidden. In response, Zeus ordered Sisyphus be chained down in the underworld. Instead, Sisyphus was able to trick Thanatos, death incarnate, and chained *him* down instead. The result? No one was able to die or get hurt for a period of time afterwards. As an aside, it's likely that LeBron himself somehow tapped into this ability. (A possible hint to his curse? We'll come to that later.) As punishment, Zeus commanded that Sisyphus be cursed to eternally roll a large boulder up a hill.   [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus) was a Greek Titan, so also very similar to James. His story is more well known, but before giving man fire, Prometheus was a Titan that fought *against* the Gods before eventually betraying his side and switching teams. The decision that Prometheus made ended up paying off for him, because the Greek God's ultimately won when the Titans couldn't quite make it all the way.  His main crime, however, was giving man the gift of fire. Fire belonged to the Gods, and Zeus didn't want man to have the heat. Because of his theft, Prometheus was ordered by Zeus (he was a busy guy it looks like), to be bound to a rock and have an eagle eat his liver out for eternity. So, after a brief stint of research and looking into the history, does the picture become clearer? I say it does.   #The Pieces Come Together  Looking into the lore of Sisyphus and Prometheus uncovers the truth. Sisyphus the King, Prometheus the Titan, are two sides of the coin that is LeBron James. Sisyphus' transgression was cheating death and unnaturally extending health by doing so. WHO in the league does this remind you of? It's LeBron James, the man whose ACL's you never even considered thinking of before until this sentence. For real, does LeBron *even have* ACL's to injure? For the amount of miles his body has on it, I've long suspected LeBron's ligaments were composed of carbon alloy of sorts. That is a different post for a different day though  As for Prometheus, his first important act was to leave the side of the Titans when he realized he couldn't win with those cats, and joined the Gods. The Greek Gods were a super team by this point that ended up winning pretty hard over the Titans. Some Titans likely considered Prometheus a traitor, perhaps even burned his jersey once he taught them what fire was. His second act was to steal fire from the Gods and give it to man. How does this relate to James? What gifts could he have given man? Well, one could argue he blessed mankind with his immeasurable talent and display of skill in the NBA, but he also gave us the fire known as his Miami Heat years. But how would this piss off a God, and even more puzzling, *which* God?  HOWEVER, if you were paying attention you'd realize the truth at this point. The stories of Sisyphus and Prometheus had one agent in common. Zeus. Ever spiteful, all powerful, Zeus dolled out the punishment in both cases. And I contend he did the same for James. Why would he do this though? Why does he care that LeBron is unnaturally increasing health and cheating death, why would Zeus care that LeBron is giving man the gift of basketball? Well quite frankly, it's obvious now that the dots are connecting. I'm here to reveal the truth about the man you all think is LeBron James, the man whose life story you all bought like fools, the man who ""doesn't know who his father is.""  #The Truth  LeBron Raymone James is none other than the son of Zeus himself. More specifically, LeBron isn't even human at all, he's the greek god [Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes). The biggest piece of [evidence](https://i.imgur.com/yVt0yTq.png) coming from /u/PENIS__FINGERS's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8nvx00/sisyphus_for_his_arrogance_was_punished_by_the/dzyr9cl/) was in front of our faces the entire time. Hermes, the fastest of the Gods, the patron God of athletes and sports, and the son Zeus never wanted to become a basketball player. This is why Zeus never attends any of his son's games. Zeus wanted LeBron to take up his mantle one day as the ruler of Olympus, but instead James opted to come down to earth and start hoopin around.   In return Zeus decided to punish him, and bound LeBron to the Cavs for large portions of his career. The end.    "
"Sometimes you even have to do math with numbers over 100. Fuck he has to follow time going backwards as well, that's a lot to keep track of. Now imagine doing all that math with LeBron James personally yelling at you, that's a pretty big distraction that not many people could handle."

Lebron james??  Oh the Cavs forward!
"With a team that was more different than the 2014 Heat. The 2015 Heat was more alike the 2014 Heat than the 2016 Heat was.   The fact of that matter is that many claimed that the Heat in 2014 minus LeBron would win the East. The 2015 Heat was pretty much 2014 Heat minus LeBron. They went 23 and 30 before Bosh went down.   Just like folks claimed the 2009 Cavs would be fine without James, then 2010 Cavs came along and lost 20+ games in a row.   History is just repeating itself.  "
"Lebron James still deserves Finals MVP, only reason the Cavs ever get close to winning.    Case and point, Curry and Durant just trading amazing games while their role players do their jobs amazingly. Meanwhile Thompson has had one off night, and Draymond is a donkey.    I know it won't happen, but still. It reality, James truly deserves it even if they get swept."

Yeah it feels like there's some revisionist history going on here.  When James went back to Cleveland most people credited his ability to lead on having the time and space to grow up in Miami.  When he came back to Cleveland you saw someone with a whole new level of ability to lead a team.  I still firmly believe that LeBron losing to Dallas on his new super team sparked this whole other level in him.
"I’m not even mad superteams exist but LeBron *did* start that stuff. All the teams you listed were assembled by the front office that way. Now players will organize this shit. It started with James for sure though, I don’t think that’s debatable. "
Saying LeBron James is a top 2 player of all time is a blatant disrespect to all the other GOATs who have 5 or 6 rings.
"Curry is not as great a defender as three of the best athletes to ever play in the league...that's not a fair comparison lol.   Curry is a completely different body type, there's no way he'll ever play the physical brand of defense that Kobe, MJ and LeBron could play. He's a smart positional defender with great instincts and good hands. He's very good at getting his man into the right spots, and he plays the game plan extremely well. Curry may not be the best iso defender when you're switching him onto James Harden or LeBron James every play, but he rarely gets lost and he almost never is responsible for breakdowns in the team defense.   He'll look worse on bad shooting nights because the nature of his game is that he takes objectively bad shots, they're just makeable for him. When they don't go in, they look bad. He still plays his ass off, runs the offense, and does his part on D. I'll take ""he's good but not as good as Kobe, MJ or LeBron"" for most players in NBA history on the defensive end."
"Yeah im in, if the cavs reverse sweep ill tattoo lebron james with his silly glasses on my calf"
It wasn't clear cut. But the only player clearly better than Wade in 2009 and 2010 was Lebron James.
Lebron James in a nutshell
"Ya, totally took credit for himself. Especially on stage accepting the trophy saying ""LeBron James &amp; the Cleveland Cavaliers. "
"""KD says I don't want a screen, let me play one on one with LeBron James""   Proceeds to accept a screen to get Hood switched onto him. Mark Jackson you big dummy."
"&gt;What’s wrong w that?  It's not just a sport. LeBron James is a human being. You want what's best for yourself as opposed to what's best for him (at least in his mind), despite how hard he's already worked for you.   &gt;If the Caps finish this off you cool w Ovechkin just bouncing or would you want to see him come back and go for another one?  Sure. If that's what he wants. Why keep someone around who doesn't want to be there? It's also an apples to oranges comparison. No one puts Ove's name in the same conversation as Gretzky, and it's unlikely he could do anything to change that. Ove's probably psyched to get 1 championship. LeBron is playing to be the greatest ever, and if that's what he wants I support him doing whatever it takes to achieve that dream. "
"They're good players if they're in the NBA. But they aren't going to win a title with that squad, LeBron or no LeBron.  The reality is, the Cavs would not even be in the playoffs without LeBron James on their team. "
Being a athlete doesn't make you a winner.   If you are going to lose anyway it's better to have a built in excuse.    - LeBron James
"gonna make a template to enable the memes. original:  &gt; As he rose up from his locker just now, LeBron James spotted the world's leading LeBron-ologist @WindhorstESPN studying his walk to see how well he was moving.

""Even if I was I wouldn't show you.""  mad-libbed:  &gt; As he rose up from his *[place/enclosed space]* just now, *[person]* spotted the world's leading *[first name/noun]*-ologist @*[twitter username]* studying his *[verb]* to see how well he was *[present participle verb]*.

"Yep. The ""Miami Heat would still win the championship without LeBron James "" argument again. "
Kemba can get buckets and carry the offense at times to let Lebron rest. He’s not Kyrie but he can score. Batum is a long ball handler. Can also initiate offense to get some burden off James.  This gets the Cavs a younger guy in Kemba in case Lebron goes too. Unless Gilbert really loves Trae.
Lebron Naismith James     
"These things are not equal. Go look at Lebron's teams and then go look at KD's teams and then after that go watch the series where KD never hit the shots that mattered the most that could have catapulted his team to championships.  KD had Russel Westbrook, James Harden, and Ibaka plus a reasonable supporting cast in one year. Then he had Russel Westbrook, Ibaka, Kanter and a great supporting cast. Please explain to me how these situations are equal because I really don't see it.  Lebron left because if he wanted to win at all he had literally no choice. KD left because he could never win on teams despite having very very realistic chances to win NBA titles."
I didn’t fail to comprehend it. I’m just so tired of hearing the same old rehashed excuses for Lebron James to be as lazy as he wants on defense so he can “carry the offensive load.” As if him playing better defense wouldn’t help ease his offensive load and improve their flow through the fast break and transition game.
"What a ridiculous take. Wade was 28, literally AT his prime and carried Lebron's ass in the 11' finals.   Miami kept like 4 guys from the year before, why did their record matter. They had a coach who dragged an entire roster of expiring contracts to win 47 games. There were 4 stars in their prime in the east. Miami took 3 of them (other being Amare). How on earth is that not a super team nor destroying competitiveness lol. Yet here you are, acting like poor Lebron went to join Michael Beasley and Jermaine O'neal lol.      &gt; The Heat were beatable for sure and had a lot of weaknesses, GSW does not seem beatable.   Lol its entirely their own fault that they seemed ""beatable"". Lebron and the Heat underperformed. Period. They seemed ""beatable"" against an aging Boston team, a 21 y/o D-Rose and a 22 y/o Paul George. There's no reason for Paul George and Roy Hibbert to be able to push Lebron James, D Wade and Bosh in their primes to 7 games. The fact is Miami underperformed despite having by far the best team in the east. Had they played properly they would've rolled right through the East like GSW.       Bottom line is, if GSW played worse to seem ""more beatable"", you wouldn't be saying all this. You're giving a pass to Lebron simply because he got pushed by the Pacers and choked against the Mavs, but then claim KD ruined basketball because he's actually balling out (as he should be)."
*Everyone knows that LeBron James is very good*   News to me!
"Don't kid yourself here. . . they were damned well trying to break the league. Lebron's comments about 1, 2. .. 8 championships shows you that. Lebron, Wade and Bosh didn't want to create a great team that would compete for titles, they wanted to create a dominant team. Three all stars, two perennial MVP candidates ALL of who were in their prime?   Just because it didn't quite work out where they won 8 straight titles doesn't mean that wasn't the intent. Bron started the engineering of super teams. He did it again when he saw that Bosh had faded a bit and that Wade wasn't the Wade he came to play with, so he took off to Cleveland to engineer another super team. Now that Durant joined the Warriors, Bron is going to do it a third time.   Durant is doing EXACTLY what James hoped to do. "

"When I review Game 3, it's obvious that the Cavs went back to what they did in 2016 and 2017, which is just physically abuse the shit out of Curry, and force the refs to make off-ball calls. Which literally NEVER happens, especially after we see JR straight up shove Steph to the ground in front of the refs. I have no idea why Steph gets no preferential treatment, while Lebron gets a call overturned by literally just complaining super hard. I get the Cavs are the underdogs, but Steph is your media darling, and the guy that brings so much attention to the sport, especially at the youth level. I coach youth basketball (ages 7-10), and I kid you not 80-90% of the kids are in love with Steph Curry, and the remaining is Lebron James. Why would you not protect your asset? This is counterintuitive to me.   "
So there were no major trades on the LeBron superteams?  https://www.sbnation.com/2010/7/10/1563131/lebron-james-sign-and-trade-miami-heat-cleveland-cavs-terms
"What a silly statement if you watched the game. Of course there's a risk, especially when Steph and Klay couldn't hit the broad side of a barn last night. You're only up 2-0 in Cleveland against the best basketball player in the world and you're taking highly contested shots from mostly ISO. There's a ton of risk in taking those shots. If you don't think that dagger of him pulling up from 30 feet was a risky shot, then I don't know what to tell you...people are just butt hurt still about KD joining the Warriors and trying to knock his performance last night down a few pegs. The fact is that KD had a very efficient 43 point game plus 13 rebounds and 7 assists in a road game against a LeBron James team. You lose that game and you're only up 2-1 and the momentum switches a bit going into game 4 in Cleveland. Instead he balled out and it's not because he has Klay and Steph on his team. It's because he's a damn good basketball player."
Michael Jordan &gt; LeBron James. Don't @ me.
"Wait what’s wrong with being a Cleveland fan? If you happen to be a fan of a team and that team becomes great what exactly is the crime here? Hell I’ve been a cavs fan since the John Williams era. I’ll be damned if I’m not allowed to revel in the glory of LeBron James, kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love!"
"A shit ton of people wish they could fly around the country watching basketball and writing / being on TV for ESPN.  Most of them are ex players, have decades of experience reporting for local news outlets, or are really really ridiculously good looking before they make it to the big time.  Brian Windhorst parlayed going to HS with LeBron into a pretty awesome career.  Props to him.  It's not a ""stalkerish obsession"", it's his goddamn job.  My favorite Windhorst anecdote:  &gt; Windhorst recalled he was an eager 21-year-old working on the agate desk and covering some high school sports for the Beacon-Journal in 1999. He heard his old high school, St. Vincent-St. Mary, suddenly had a group of talented freshman. That struck Windhorst as odd since St. Vincent-St. Mary hardly was known for strong basketball.  &gt; “They were 3-17 when I was a senior,” he said.  &gt; With his curiosity piqued, Windhorst was the lone reporter in a sparsely filled gym during that first sighting. James only scored 15 points, but “you could tell he was different than anyone else,” Windhorst said.  &gt; When Windhorst lobbied to cover more of James’ games, his boss initially resisted. “He thought I was trying to favor my old high school,” he said.

Bro if you really don't understand the difference between a team that placed 5th in the eastern and was eliminated in the first round adding a mid tier allstar and lebron james and the back to back finalists and champions with the back to back MVP and four allstars adding an MVP you need to go back to kindergarten to learn how to count.

Now, a more conspiracy esque question would be... Is the nba extended the playoffs for more ad revenue and influence gambling? That is a definite possibility "
I'm at a loss here. The 89-90s Pistons played basketball harder than the NFL plays football today. If LeBron James played in the NBA in 1990 his soul would have left his body the first time he drove the lane and took a legit foul. Had have died. Under the rim. In front of the world. 
I mean on one hand he has the monumental pressure of playing with lebron james. Playing against people who are more talented and smarter than him. Im sure a lot of people would crack under similar pressure. However after seeing him last night in the 1st quarter barreling into curry every play. All i can say is fuck that dirty player
"Sweet! Another Lebron James alternate universe comic! Well, if we follow his lore from his past editions, we know that Horford, Hayward, Irving, Tatum, Rozier, Smart, Morris and Brown are all catch and shoot 3’ers now. Unless they drastically rewrite his character (which I don’t think the fans would be too fond of). "
"Ball movement heavy offenses negate some of Lebrons best talents. Lebron is the best player in the world, why would you negate parts of his game so Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood can reach their full potential? Clearly the team is overachieving with Lebron on the ball as much as possible.   I mean there’s definitely downside to having formerly ball dominant players play with Lebron. And the Cavs might want to try and strike a little more of a balance to give the other guys more confidence. But the notion that the Cavs should switch to an egalitarian, ball movement offense so that George Hill can get more touches is silly and would likely make the team worse because it increases the amount of time that people not named Lebron James are making decisions."
"He already ruined his legacy by having burner acocunts, having his mom go on sports center to defend him from all the 'haters' after they won their first ring (or second one).   He left the thunder, which had Westbrook, a top 5PG and overall top 15 or 10 player in the league, and James harden. When lebron left, Dan Gilbert and co wouldn't get him anything help after staying for I believe 7 seasons. I don't think he ever had an all-star teammate in that time, but kd had Russell Westbrook and James harden! This guy literally was on a team with 3 mvp players and they couldn't win or come close in the finals with the that squad. They even lost 4-1 to Memphis in the 2nd round lmao. Ibaka was also a solid player when he was with that squad.   Even if KD returns to OKC, no one respects him for what he did, joining the historically best team. He can't bring them a ring bc OKC is in a salary cap disaster with melo, and it's a tad better if they could trade him. He didn't see his window to winclosing; he was 26 when he joined the warriors, and has been playing his prime at GSW. He got tired of losing and jumped shipped. LeBron returned, brought a hard fought championship, and enhanced his game to a god-like level. These two guy's legacy are like an inverse relationship both off and on the court as players and relations with the fanbase. "
If that's true then you wouldn't be a GM in the NBA for very long. Trading LeBron James for the 29th pick in the first round??
"No one human can.  The cybernetic organism known as LeBron James has extensive files on the skill levels of his human Cavs teammates, along with directives to “overcome these deficiencies to win at all costs”."

Now the two tops all-time of r/nba are LeBron James passing to himself and dunking. 
"&gt; go join LeBron if want but don’t go to the best team in the league  This isn't as bad as joining the Dubs (a tier below I'd say), but I still consider the Cavs and Dubs as 2 teams KD shouldn't have went to if he wanted to cement his legacy. At the end of the day, not only would dethroning the King cement his legacy more but James also took a ring from him and he is regarded as KD's biggest obstacle and a lot regard him as the only man standing above him (split because others consider Curry to be there too, but James did it the longest and even plays the same position).   But your point is still correct"

"“Looking to see if I have an [expletive] squad now?” James asked Windy with a smile. “Even if I did,  I wouldn't look THAT different” James said with a sly wink. Windy giggled , and proceeded to fantasize at the possibility of LeBron in a towel.  "
"&gt; people only hate the top team, any underdog, even if its Lebron James, will win their hearts  But they're also trying to change the narrative of LeBron's villain years too, and act like he's *always* been some hopeless underdog even when he was on the Heatles at their peak."
The funny part was that he was doing this in the 2012 Finals too when James Harden had 5 consecutive awful games and Russ had 4 stinkers.   KD was the best player in two of those games against LeBron and late prime Wade
Thanks. Certainly good points. I will save and comment pending what Lebron James does after this Finals. 
"I-  I don't think so.  I said the same thing during the Rockets series.  Kevin Durant's a great basketball player. He's one of the best scorers of all time, he's playing much better defense than LeBron James is this post season. I can admit all these things.  I'm not blinded by the fact that my team is losing.  But Kevin Durant is -objectively- what I would consider as a pussy. He shrivels in the face of adversity, joins the group of people who beat him, took a paycut to remain on that team-..wait, let me stop here for a second. Let me explain to you how bad this part is.  Imagine this in any other profession. Say you're a very talented lawyer and you get your ass kicked in a case by a young, powerful firm. You decide 'fuck my relatively good firm that has a chance of winning if we appeal' and go join the younger firm. You sit back and relax, let the younger guys go out and win cases, only stepping in when they need your expertise.  Sounds like the right career move, right? Except at the end of the year, they do end-of-term evaluations and decide to DROP YOUR SALARY. You're a good ass lawyer, you have several well known firms asking for your services at a much higher salary offer. But you, too scared to risk losing, or even being responsible for your own success, decide to take LESS MONEY to be second fiddle to another guy.  In any other profession, he'd come off as a pussy who literally jeopardizes his success in life for success in a (comparatively for the sake of this metaphor) trivial matter that means shit outside of it (see: court cases won vs. basketball games won)  Like I said, the dude's good as fuck, but he's a pansy.  Let me reiterate. It's like doing the bully's homework because he promised to pay you a dollar to do so, -and- he'd stop beating your ass. Instead of standing up to him, you take it, and earn some money.  Eventually he says he's gonna' stop paying you, but to keep doing his homework. You, afraid of getting your ass beat, continue to do it. He also lets you sit at the lunch table with the other cool kids. (ring comparison)  I can't speak for the rest of his personal character, because I don't know him. I don't know if he's nice, mean, dumb, smart, whatever. But what I do know, is that he is certifiably bitch-made.  "
"Omg! You LeBronies are killing me!! Any other hypothetical proposals, aimed at giving Prince James a shred of a possibility against a highly- skilled.

Please, stop with this nonsense and accept that LeBron is a great plater, but when it comes down to the hardware, there are many who rank above him"
"yes, i know my name suggests otherwise, but this series is really doing it for me in the GOAT case for LeBron James. The GOAT doesn't pout and cross arms like a kid before he has another chance to steal a game. the GOAT doesn't proceed to go ahead and become this passive player who looks like he's never shot behind the restriction line in the next two games. YES, I know Lebron put up a triple double tonight but I expect that from a ball dominant 6'9 athletic point forward who is one of the greats. and lastly, the GOAT does not shy away from Kevin Durant when we all knew who was taking the last shot with 1 minute to go. if you see the replay, its kinda remarkable how easily Lebron slipped outta there and allowed Rodney Hood to get some of that smoke. I haven't watched Jordan play but from what Ive seen, he always had heart and envisioned success each and every night. Goodnight."
"As he rose up from the restricted area and ran to half court, JR Smith spotted the world's leading NBAologist Lebron James studying his moves to see where he was going. ""Looking to see if I'm high?"" JR asked James with a smile. ""Even if I was I wouldn't say ‘I thought we were up’."""

""You're about to become a father. Tell me how you feel.""  &gt;""Excited"", LeBron said, ""but also a little nervous.""  &gt;Brian asked him what he was going to name his first son.  &gt;""LeBron"", LeBron said.  &gt;The story Brian wrote was about LeBron's excitement, and how he wanted to be a better dad than his own dad was for him.  &gt;After the birth of his son, ­LeBron returned to training camp, and all the other reporters asked him about it.

"It's skewed because Golden State's roster allows him to not be heavily defended and while he is arguably the greatest player, I still give it to LeBron James.  I mean, look at what he did with the Cavs roster and dragging it to the Finals.  He's dropped 30+ points in every game so far, 51 in game 1 on this Warriors team.  If age wasn't a factor, I'm still picking LeBron 10/10 times."

Listen dude, the point I was tryna make is that Lebron’s teams from 2010-2017 were super teams and very little people would disagree with me. Would you ?  &gt; No it's not a real job title. Even before the playoffs, people weren't rating them. Stars become more important in the playoffs, the Spurs have had depth, but they had stars with it. Ty Lawson, Iguodala etc are not Tim Duncan and Tony Parker.  Go look at the playoff series predictions on ESPN before that series. Literally everyone picked the nuggets to beat the dubs, and that was before they lost David Lee. Cmon man, who you tryna fool ?   Is the point you’re making here that Steph can’t carry teams ? Bc calling the nuggets a “weak 57-win team” isn’t convincing anyone.  &gt; What this debate started about was who meant more to their franchise. If you don't think a finals appearance matters to a franchise then go ask the fans of a team who hasn't been to one. You want to ignore Lebron's finals appearance, but put in the 73 wins even though they didn't win a title that year. That's a rather clear double standard.  When did I say finals appearances don’t matter ? If you include finals appearances, Lebron’s taken Cleveland to 5 while Steph’s taken the dubs to 4. Steph still turned a garbage irrelevant franchise into an NBA dynasty while Lebron’s turned them into NBA champions. Led them to 3 titles while Lebron’s only led them to 1. And if you wanna discredit Steph’s importance in that, I mean, juss look at today’s game. He was blitzed and doubled every P&amp;R, and bc of that, Javale went 5-7, Jordan Bell went 4-5. Livingston went 4-5. Dray went 4-8. That doesn’t happen without Steph. He’s the axis that the warriors revolve around and I juss feel he doesn’t get as much credit for winning on a superteam as Lebron has for winning on a superteam, so that’d probably be the thesis of my argument.   &gt;  (As a side note, Lebron's teams had stars on them, but they also had big minutes from Joel Anthony, Udonis Haslem, Norris Cole. He never had the players around him that Steph has at the Warriors. And Lebron was never the second best player on his team).  First of all, Steph makes role players significantly better than Lebron does. Like I said, Javale went 5-7, Jordan Bell went 4-5. Livingston went 4-5. Dray went 4-8. That doesn’t happen without Steph. And look at the players who got big minutes in 2014-2016 on the dubs that left. Mo Speights rides the bench on the magic. Leandro Barbosa’s out of the league. Festus Ezeli doesn’t even have a team anymore. Steph has had a ton of players who were juss as good, if not worse, than Shane Battier or Udonis Haslem or Norris Cole, and it’s complete revisionist history suggest that he hasn’t.   Second of all, Lebron might not have even been the 3rd best player in that 2011 finals against the mavs. Third of all, Steph has been the most valuable warrior since 2013  &gt; You want to ignore the first part of Lebron's career where he dragged bad teams deep in the playoff (where the team fell apart as soon as he left).  I’m really not, like I said, I think what Lebron did with this 2018 Cavs squad is imo the most impressive thing he’s ever done in his career. But if you’re gonna acknowledge how he won with worse talent, then you also have to look at how he lost with better talent. I mean, surely no one forgets when Steph Curry lost with better talent...   &gt;  You want to criticise Lebron for only winning with superteams but started off by crediting Step for recruiting Durant as part of his positive effect.  I mean, yeah. Steph is a magnet and creates a locker room chemistry that everybody feels loved and appreciated in. He buys gifts for the other guys and cheers his head off for all his teammates on the bench. Everyone in the dubs locker room talk about how amazing their chemistry is. Meanwhile in Lebron-led locker rooms, it’s seasons long of players only meetings, finger-pointing, coaching changes, ESPN articles about if the Cavs players even like each other, etc. I mean, Lebron went into Miami and wanted pat Riley to fire Eric Spo for Christ’s sake. Curry creating a more inviting locker room than Lebron is definitely something that I hold positively for Steph"
"&gt; but Kd had a 3-1 lead against the team he left for.  -rolls eyes-   &gt; he was in a great position to win a championship,  His GM traded James Harden to save 4 million dollars...  &gt; Lebron played with trash in Cleveland  So he got on a superteam, just like Durant later did :O"
"Yes they should, if they actually want to be remembered as better players. That's the difference between James Jones' legacy and Nash's. People will never use the rings argument then, even.if they'll use it to discuss actual greats like Kobe, LeBron, Magic, MJ, Shaq, etc...   Durant fucked up his legacy. He's a Kobe-level player who will be remembered as a James Jones."
"If we're being completely honest  Jason Kidd age in 2011: 38 years old.  Shawn Marion 33 years old.  Tyson Chandler 30 years old.  Dirk 33 years old.  Jason Terry 34 years old.  If I remember correctly, the Mavs had the oldest team in the NBA that year in terms of average age. Think about the assignments \- 33 year old Shawn Marion guarding 27 year old Lebron fucking james. 38 year old Jason Kidd guarding 29 year old Dwayne Wade. 33 year old Dirk vs a 27 year old Bosh.  They weren't cast offs but they were all well past their primes playing Wade, Lebron, and Bosh at their absolute PEAKS."
so we gonna see CP3 + LeBron James in a Lakers or 76ers uniform? 
"What is this magic NBA team that Lebron James is going to create that's better on paper because there aren't any teams with two all stars and cap space, let alone 3."
"The quote was continued by LeBron James saying, ""Instead I'd ask you... wanna see me limp?""  "
LeBron James to the Phoenix Suns confirmed.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
That's what happens when you have an NBA finals with Lebron James in it. More people are talking about how Lebron didn't guard KD or rehashing 'HOW YOU GONNA BE MAD AT KD WHEN LEBRON DID THE SAME THING??' takes.
"As he rose up from his locker just now, LeBron James spotted the world's leading LeBron-ologist @WindhorstESPN studying his walk to see how well he was moving. ""Looking to see if I wana get sucked off tonight?"" James asked Windy with a smile. ""Even if I was I wouldn't let you."""
"After the next couple of days... LeBron is done. His legacy ends this week. Golden State has denied him three times. There won't be a 3\-0 comeback.. You are more likely to be hit by lightning or win the lottery twice in your lifetime. Steph is the Tom Brady of the NBA. LeBron is more like Peyton Manning.. I remember in 2nd grade back in the day when some idiot in my class thought Peyton would retire with 8 rings.. That is LeBron James. His legacy will be ""Some kid from Ohio that we wasted 20 years debating him being better than MJ"""
"Mind. Blown. Can’t wait to come back to this when it comes true. It all starts when Ty Lue says he’s not playing Hood next game followed by SIKE, I’m starting that MF. Hood plays horrible. Lebron goes 62 12 and 12 right after James harden wins the MVP. Lebron wins FMVP, donates it to Harden.. cause that’s just the kind of guy he is and we are lucky to have him "
**Breaking: LeBron James signs with Brooklyn Nets**   *monkey's paw vanishes into thin air*
"See how quickly you've forgotten? People were saying this exact same shit about LeBron's super team. How it ruins the fun and ruins the league.   LeBron's been to the finals 8 times in a row and you don't even care. 8 fucking times, and we supposed to pretend the east isn't boring af. Imagine if we didn't have the warriors, and the west was as weak as the east. LeBron James super teams just strolls through for an easy W. He doesn't even try during the regular season anymore, that's how embarrassing it is. "
Kevin James totally needs to play Windy in the big budget Lebron biopic. 
They'd definitely batter the Western conference.  Injury free CP3  The Beard  Lebron James  Clint Capela Shit looks scary already
"It also isnt a 1v1 game. Lebron james is the greatest BASKETBALL player ever and its not close. Jordan is the best scorer and fiercest competitor. Lebron is a complete basketball player. Elite passer, rebounder, scorer, defender when he isn't carrying bums on offense.   Edit: Yeah I know I'm going to get downvoted. "
"Can you really blame him?  If this dude even had solid role players around him, this series would be 2-1 possibly in favor of Cleveland.  Not even superstars like James Harden or Chris Paul or Kyrie Irving.  LeBron is proving that he is the greatest in the world and he can't even get help for 4 quarters.  Rodney Hood was decent tonight but that's it.  Kevin Love hasn't been AWFUL but the majority of this team refuses to play defense or they're playing scared.  This dude just played every single regular season game on top of 40+ minutes every damn playoff game and the rest of your team which is supposed to be NBA players can't hold a lead or play some damn defense.  I totally get it and I feel for LeBron."
"I'll bite. Steve Javie contended Curry held on before LeBron committed the offensive foul. In the replay, it looks as though Steph held onto James as a reaction to getting displaced by the offensive foul."
"""And Rick James from deep.. Bang! Oh I meant Lebron. My bad. "" "
get lebron onto a team with chris paul and james harden or ben simmons and joel embiid and then try to beat him with jordan clarkson... genius
"We need a new league above the NBA just for LeBron James to play on.  They don't let pro players go back to a college team, and they shouldn't allow this. "
&gt; Who would be the basketball equivalent of Eli Manning winning two Super Bowl MVPs against the Pats?  Lebron James winning in 2016.

""Looking to see if I'm getting the ball to who he's guarding?"" James asked Windy with a smile while looking in Curry's direction. ""Even if I was I wouldn't show you.""  "
If you ask me he would unquestionably be the GOAT if he was named James LeBron.
Win rings.  Terrify the other team at all times.  Play defense.  LeBron James is shooting ass&amp;#37; or giving it up vs Curry this series.  Recruit.  Keep his team together.  Run his team.  Stay healthy.  We can do this for a while.
"Lebron James complains after every single call. He always talks to the referees after every call that doesn't go his team's way. Maybe he is super polite in those situations, but from the other side of the TV screen it seems he just complains too much."
"ummmm everyone hated lebron and the heat as well, and then when LeBron left to go to Cleveland is when everyone started liking him again, and the same will happen for KD if he leaves the Warriors. people only hate the top team, any underdog, even if its Lebron James, will win their hearts"
"GOOOD, GOOOD! 3-0, a commanding lead! They are on their knees before you for the second year in a row Warriors. This time do not grant them the mercy of being able to stand with a single win. Crush them into the dirt this time, put final nail into Cleveland's coffin and go for the clean sweep.  Prove again and once and for all that there is no *defending the Cleveland* when Warriors come to come to conquer. Show them that *whatever it takes* is not enough, because they do not have what it takes.  Then everyone can go home and shut up about this sordid sport for another year and Lebron can (hopefully) go over to Philly. Or better yet (even though the chances are horribly slim), over to Golden State. Ahaha just imagine, King James abandoning his Kingdom to join the Warriors that he (hopefully) twice failed to defend his land from. It would be delicious.  Ah, but I cannot get ahead of myself. It is good to dream, but we mustn't fall victim to premature celebration. Game 4 still remains and so do the rest if the Cavs somehow get lucky. Until then we'll just have to put our best hopes forward for Sunday. May the day see the cup held high over Golden State's magnificent banner once again."
Finals MVP.   LEBRON JAMES! Scoopity poop btw.   
Kyrie Irving?  /s  I don’t even know if someone like James Harden would balance it. I think it’d have to be someone like Kawhi. You give LeBron Kawhi Leonard and we might have ourselves a series.

First MVP on a losing Finals team in 30ish years??   LEBRON JAMES! Scoopity poop btw.   
"Honestly who fucking cares?... They’re the two best players of all time that play completely different roles on completely differently-talented teams.   Impossible to compare legitimately.   Edit: One thing Jordan has had that James has never really had is that natural leadership and want to fucking rip his enemies’ throats out and drink their blood.   * Jordan: *”I want to kill these fucks and win the title”*  * James: *”K. We’re in the finals. We can’t lose today if we’re going to win”*  I’ve represented my country internationally in a sport and have been playing high-level sports all my life - trust me when I tell you that Lebron lacks a winners mentality and this rubs off on his teammates. You can see the fear in his eyes at the very first hurdle. He’s learned to keep a facade up but there’s always that underlying uncertainty right behind the veil.   It’s clear as day that he’s never had someone to really mentor him while he was still new in the league, whether a coach or a vet.... He had too much responsibility thrust onto his shoulders much too early and it’s haunted him his entire career in the Finals."
Are we all 100% agreed that this man is the GOAT???    Lebron James. I am here to kick ass and chew bubble gum. And I am all out of bubble gum.   
"Haha sure, zenmaster. I hope to be as enlightened as you one day.   Did any of those things I listed not occur?   You say I’m looking for things to create a narrative, I say you’re ignoring what’s in front of your face to create a narrative and that you’re falling for PR  [Here’s a good read about Kyrie falling out with LeBron, who had special privileges and made Kyrie feel like a second fiddle](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2723274-report-kyrie-irving-tired-irritated-playing-robin-to-lebron-james-batman)  Don’t get me wrong, it’s not easy to stay humble when you’re the best in the world at something, and LeBron tries to be a good role model. But it comes across as inauthentic/PR and if you dig behind the scenes, it’s clear that he’s a “my way or the highway” type which is why I can never root for him"
"I thought we've past the Kobe vs LeBron, we are on to James and Jordan now."
How dare you speak the name of the **GOAT**.    [Lebron James](/r/fidgetspin)   
Finals MVP.   Lebron James. I am here to kick ass and chew bubble gum. And I am all out of bubble gum.   
"Rudy Gobert at C  Kristaps Porzingis at PF  Robert Covington and/or Joe Ingles as backup SF.  If you want guards, put Donovan Mitchell and Jaylen Brown at PG and SG respectively.  Damn I'm imagining a line up like that for Brony Boy.  PG: Donovan Mitchell, Fred VanVleet, TJ McConnell  SG: Jaylen Brown, CJ Miles, Pat Connaughton  SF: LeBron James, Robert Covington, Luc Mbah a Moute  PF: Kristaps Porzingis, Joe Ingles, Jae Crowder  C: Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Dwight Powell"
How dare you speak the name of the **GOAT**.    [Lebron James](/r/fidgetspin)   
PG-Pat Beverley $1 SG-Danny Green $1 SF-Joe Ingles $2 PF-Lebron James $6 C- Anthony Davis $5  Top-tier defenders all around. Good outside threats while being capable passers. 
"Lol...  We just saw a Boston team without Kyrie *or* Hayward beat the 76ers in 5 games--and the 76ers are one of the top-tier potential destinations for him.  Whether *any* team LeBron can join this summer can beat GS is an open question, but the following team would give him as good or better a chance than the 76ers, Rockets, Lakers, or Spurs would:  PG - LeBron James   SG - Jaylen Brown   SF - Gordon Hayward   PF - Jayson Tatum   C - Al Horford   6 - Marcus Smart   7 - Terry Rozier   8 - Aron Baynes   9 - Daniel Theis   10 - Semi Ojeleye  (plus any vet minimum ringchasers)  The defensive switchability of that top 5 would be insane, and that would be the team that beat the 76ers in 5 and took the Cavs to 7... PLUS LeBron and PLUS Hayward."
The problem is the fact that a bad LeBron James team can outplay better teams in the East. Swap Houston and Cleveland in the Finals and suddenly it was so mismatched. The Cavs have no business in the Finals this year but he made it and it shows.  I’m still reading about how Cavs should have won game 1 and Houston should have won their series. Sorry but I thought there was no chance?
"If Brown at the very least isn’t on the table I don’t see Cleveland making the trade to a rival.  I really think it’s either Brown involved or nothing.  And Boston would jump at that.  If that’s the only way they can get LeBron James, they would be absolute idiots not to.  Jaylen Brown isn’t worth keeping if it means you lose out on LeBron James. "
"I really don't think you can compare them, but lets not get crazy here.  The year after winning their third title, when Jordan left to play baseball, the bulls went 55-27 and made it to the second round of the playoffs.  This Cav's team wouldn't even make the playoffs without LeBron.  Jordan always had better teams than LeBron's Cleveland teams, even if he didn't have crazy stacked ones, and he had one of the greatest coaches of all time in Phil Jackson.  Regardless, they are totally different players.  Jordan was an insane athlete but never had the 1 in a billion height, weight, strength, etc of James.  They also played in different eras - the league has changed a lot since Jordan."

"If people are arguing he's the freaking greatest player of all time then yes, a LeBron James uncontested 20 ft shot is much better than 2 free throws for George fucking Hill... same exact thing happened last year in game 3 when he passed it to Korver. Then it's always his teammates fault lol"
"Then if he's LeBron James he should have taken the damn shot... then he went off crying, spent the break not even talking to his team and went 0-4 in overtime. Didn't take a shot until they were down 7...  51-8-8 and then ends up that game that way, it completely ruined it."
"Yes because another top 50 player of all time and James Jones are clearly equal comparisons. Dude doesn't have the greatest argument ever made but you're acting like he's saying something stupid. Jordan had help put AROUND him, LeBron waited years and years in Cleveland for that to happen and it just didn't. If he had a 90's Bulls-esque team given to him in Cleveland his first time, he wouldn't have left lol.  Likewise, Jordan would've not accomplished nearly as much if he kept that same shitty team around him, much like LeBron's early Cavs.  Edit: And don't even get me started on coaching. You can say whatever you want or think whoever is the GOAT, but saying Jordan is better because he didn't leave to a superteam is stupid. Of course he didn't, because it was built around him. He didn't have to like LeBron did."
Because hes LeBron James wtf?
Lebron James ball washers are so adorable.
$1 - Pat Beverley $6 - LeBron James $5 - Kawhi Leonard $1 - PJ Tucker $2 - Myles Turner
"I sort of feel like whenever a player signs a 5 year max contract at 27 the last few years end up being overpay. Though Love has been pretty steady so maybe he'll still be a max player until the end of the contract.  But its also worth pointing out that the logic of max contracts is all wonky because Gordon Hayward =/= LeBron James, as in there is a difference between superstar max players (players worth more than the max) and 'merely max players.' If you are giving max money to someone who is 'only' worth the max, you are getting less for your max than a team who gave a max to a superstar. So in a weird way, all max contracts are bad unless they are for the very best players in the league."

"1.)  Danny Green and Rudy Gay decline their player options for 2018-2019.  This would free up $19 million.  It's likely Gay will opt in, so this is already unlikely from the start.  There will be a solid market for Danny Green, so likely he opts out to explore it.  Not a great 3-and-D market and it's highly coveted right now.  2.) Don't re-sign Tony Parker, who is unrestricted.  As a Spurs fan, already difficult to think of him closing his career with another team, but it would have to be done.  Best you can do is hope to sign him at the vet minimum.  3a.)  Trade Pau Gasol.  This will be extraordinarily difficult.  He clocks in a $16 mil.  Although absolutely underrated defender this year (one of the best rim protectors in the league), obviously waning in offensive performance and doesn't have the speed for the modern NBA.  Good luck offloading him, but a team looking to bottom out may be interested since the second year clocks in at considerably less.  More likely, though...  3b.)  Waive Pau using the stretch provision.  Spurs, as a small market team, have not been fans of the stretch provision.  It hurts your salary cap for years, and the idea of ""dead money"" while trying to compete is a tough one to take for a team that doesn't like to go over the cap.  So, if you are able to accomplish 1-3, you can sign James.  The issue is, what's left?  Kawhi, Lebron, and LMA (with Mills, Murray, and a potentially re-signed Kyle Anderson) looks like a contender, but what's around them?  Maybe a vet contributor with the MLE?  Maybe convince Green to come back using bird rights after he declines the player option, if they're willing to go into the tax?  Maybe find a couple of rotation players off the scrap heap?  It's a lot of maybe's.  That being said, it's possible.  Green and Lebron are close.  Lebron is a mentor to Murray already and they keep in touch.  Lebron and Pop have been fans of each other for years.  It's not crazy, just unlikely.  But if Lebron says he's in, SA will make it happen."
Has LeBron James ever had his picture on a bubblegum card? How can someone be great if they've never had their picture on a bubblegum card?
Because they should have just had the parade after they beat the Rockets....   Seriously there was like 200 NBA articles on news sites the day after game 4. And 180 of them were about Lebron James. 
Jordan also had a fucking dream team at his disposal. LeBron James had a high school basketball team that he had to carry . When jordan decided to play baseball the Bulls had 3 all stars and still made the playoffs

"He was excellent during all of those finals (admittedly except for the one against the Pistons which they lost) and bailed them out numerous times when Shaq was struggling. If we're going to penalize Kobe for playing with an all-time great, does that mean LeBron's titles with Wade don't count? Kobe won two titles where his second best player was Pau Gasol. I love Pau, but LeBron had Wade and then Irving to shoulder the load when it came to playing on the ball, and Kobe never had that. Kobe also had less from a physical standpoint to work with. It's sort of like Ronaldo-Messi. Like Messi is a more naturally gifted player, and Ronaldo has had to work to approach that same level. I'd still consider Messi the better player, but there's an argument there. It's the same way in this debate. It's not like the disparity is enormous. It's close enough that we can have an argument. It's easy to point to stats and be like ""LeBron has more rebounds more assists LeBron&gt;&gt;&gt;Kobe"" but in that case Westbrook was better than James this year, and that's obviously not the case. "
"While there are clearly some points here that I disagree with (the statistical oversimplification), the gist of this is correct. According to the GM poll done at the time, [63% of GMs considered LA rather than Miami to be the favorite that season.](http://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/20224/gms-picking-against-lebron-james) So while Lebron did go and create a super-team (""Not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7"" ahem), the expected degree of dominance is simply not comparable. "
"&gt; Yea that championship was great for James but have LeBron win 3 in a row , leave nba for 18 months come back and 3 more in a row.  Jordan left and his team was still one of the best contenders in the east with Scottie leading the pack (and coming, IIRC, 3rd in MVP voting that year). He left a superteam and came back to a superteam. Meanwhile, the moment LeBron left the Cavs, they went on the longest losing streak (at the time) in NBA history, and he actually made it through the first round."

"Lebron fucking james with Kyrie took 1. To say Kawhi is guaranteed that 1, with 17 minutes left, is foolish.  Likely win, but that series was still toast"
"Lebron James doesnt have the testicular fortitude to even be considered in the same league as Jordan. Jordan would have never quit in a game and allowed himself to be swept. Jordan would have never left his hometown to join a team with the players he should have been trying to beat. Most importantly Jordan wouldnt have let one of his teamates fuck his moms and embaress him so much he couldn't function in the ensuing game. Last but not least, Jordan wouldnt have come out with a soft cast talking about his hand was broke the last 3 games even though he was dunking and dribbling and shaking up with his sons after the game."
“Lebron James the GOAT” r/nba folks who haven’t even watched jordan highlights on YouTube let alone full games 
"You must not watched Jordan play. Yea that championship was great for James but have LeBron win 3 in a row , leave nba for 18 months come back and 3 more in a row. That is greater than anything anyone has ever done. Oh did I mention he has 6 finals MVPs with no finals losses?"
"The Rockets have everything to do with what you’re talking about. You’re complaining that KD’s decision to join the Warriors has negatively affected parity without acknowledging that the Rockets finished with the best record in the NBA, are lead by the league MVP, and were in prime position to advance to the finals if not for an injury to Chris Paul and an historically poor shooting night. These realities directly contradict the bullshit you’re peddling.      Meanwhile, through all your bitching, you fail to mention LeBron James, who has come out of the Eastern conference 8 straight times. I.e. You’re full of it."
"6'9 260 Lebron James lost to an aging Dirk and role players in the Finals with prime Wade/Bosh on his team. Lebron also just got swept for the 2nd time in his career in the Finals. 6 180 Allen Iverson got you 1 win vs Shaq/Kobe, cmon bruh you a clown.  Please GTFOH with this stupid talk."
"Dwight Howard taller and bigger than LeBron James, and you telling me James is better?"
"LOL this place, man. Just revisionist history to dry up salty tears.    Lebron was universally hated for his decision. 100x more than KD ever got. People who didn't even watch basketball hated Lebron. Yeah, he had no idea it would actually work. *not 1, not 2, not 3*   Now you're gonna act like calling up 2 other hall-of-famers was a gutsy move that no one was sure was going to turn out?  lol i guarantee you weren't watching this shit in 2010.   This is a piece from a bleacher report article in 2010 after Bron's exit. This is like the KD hot takes you see on reddit every day, but they were being put out by journalists.   &gt;What this move signals is the end of competitive balance and ushers in a new “rich get richer, poor get poorer” era. Since this formation a lot of former players have come forward and said they would have never done something like this. Can you imagine how horrible the NBA would have been had all those guys teamed up to win hollow championships? If you can imagine that, then brace yourself for the next generation.  &gt;This isn’t about the Heat winning a couple of titles. This also isn’t about me disliking James’ attitude. This is about the fact that the best players aren’t trying to be the best anymore. They want to play with the best, instead of being the best. "
"Then go here:    I am 100&amp;#37;  dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50&amp;#37; chance that  lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.  I  am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then  artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human  being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism.  AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the  decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at  18 years old? it's un\-natural. how often have TV analysts described him  as a ""freak of nature"" .....maybe it's truer than we know.  I  am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be  insulting or mean) that lebron's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted  prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this  to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have  sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.  and  the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished  people in ""experiments."" read about MK\-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used  to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch  what happened thru 2\-way mirrors. the government helped start and  continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.  I  believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super  soldiers. something where they were just like ""well let's test it out on  some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any  results before we sink more billions into this."" it's not all that  crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating  genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does.  it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in  such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would  be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.  he's  some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and  let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with  just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it  started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show  the results to the higher ups and say ""look at this, you don't wanna  fund this on a larger scale?""  and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?  I  think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now  filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they  couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16\-18  years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came  off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a  bunch of 9\-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but  given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret  barracks right now.....  until someone  comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch  have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is  AT LEAST possible..  edit: something I'd  like to add in case someone says ""well if this is true why wouldn't  lebron's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a  government experiment and lebron was the result."" well she doesn't know.  it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a  drink and she gets knocked out\-cold. they take her and do whatever they  did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when  she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even  the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got  knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated  willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her  crazy ass."

I guess Michael Jordan is insane too and knows nothing about basketball  Also I was being pretty civil but some will say anything for some karma I guess lol  Edit: also this is what I’m referencing:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/article/2017/08/02/michael-jordan-ranks-kobe-bryant-ahead-lebron-james
"&gt;We know this isn’t why kyrie left. He wanted his own team, he wasn’t upset by being called “a guy from the Y” because absolutely no one called him that  I think that there is more to pretty much every relevant statement here than you are considering.  First:  &gt;Can Lebron carry a group of guys from the Y to the finals.  Nobody literally thinks these guys are from the Y.  Even if you think that guys are underperforming or on the downside of their career, they are still NBA players.  As such, ""guys from the Y"" basically means ""guys not good enough to do shit without LeBron.""  Now let's apply that to your statement of:  &gt;...he wasn’t upset by being called “a guy from the Y” because absolutely no one called him that  There are *plenty* of people that feel that Kyrie wasn't good enough to get shit done without James.    Dude on this sub just the other day got lots of upvotes for pointing out that Kyrie never won more than 33 games before LeBron got there.  Yeah, that's stupid because he has developed a ton since then and those Cavs teams were really hurt for talent otherwise, but that doesn't change the fact that people push and believe that narrative.  Just pointing out that nobody says he is a guy from the Y ignores pretty much all relevant context from the conversation.  &gt;He wanted his own team...  Again, there is more to it than this.  I mean, teams like the Spurs were on his list of trade destinations and they already had Kawhi and LMA.  Clearly, ""wanting his own team"" means more than just being the top guy on the team because the Spurs weren't trading Kawhi and, at the time, *nobody* was thinking that it was going to be Irving's team over someone like Kawhi.  As such, ""wanting his own team"" logically means something different than wanting to be the alpha dog.  Logically, it just means that he wants proper respect for what he does and he wants a franchise that values him enough to build around him as a long term center-piece.  That wasn't the case with the Cavs because the window for James isn't the same as the window for Irving.  I mean, fuck, look at the Cavs moves over the past 4-5 years.  Every single one of them have been designed to prioritize winning right now with no fucks given for how trash they are if/when LeBron leaves.  I think that the fact that he listed teams like the Spurs on his list makes it clear it was more about a team that values him enough to try to build contenders around him for the majority of his prime as opposed to being cool with him spending his prime on a team that is capped out with zero other assets to build around.  Ignoring all this and just saying ""he wanted his own team"" and leaving it at that leaves out tons of relevant information."

Updated to change the data set for Lebron James and Steph Curry. The data set with the suffix (+2018) is their updated win %'s. Lebron moved up a lot whereas Steph Curry's close game win % became even worse.  From the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7zan5y/oc_win_of_alltime_greats_in_close_games_playoffs/dummss7/  --------------------------  All seasons where their team made the playoffs in their primes. **It's worth noting that I just got the seasons and not necessarily the games where they played in.** Close games are games won or lost within 5 points.  In this case the prime seasons **that I selected** are:  - Kobe: 2001-2010 - Lebron: 2009-2018 (UPDATED) - Larry Bird: 1980-1992 - Gary Payton: 1994-2003 - Paul Pierce: 2002-2012 - Shaq: 1995-2006 - Michael Jordan: 1988-1998 - Karl Malone: 1990-2000 - Melo: 2004-2014 - Steve Nash: 2001-2010 - Steph Curry: 2013-2018 (UPDATED) - Tim Duncan: 1998-2009 - Hakeem: 1985-1996

"A rookie PG averaging close to 10/7/7/1/1  with very good defense is bad?

"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager LeBron James sadly waited outside the locker room after the final buzzer to give the players on his former team a final goodbye on Friday night. Former good player Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go to a good team!” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J. Clarkson yelled out, “I got an [expletive] green light now.” And before James hit the blackboard, former NBA Game 1 Legend J.R. Smith hugged him and said, “I am ready for Game 5.”"
"1) I'm not a Spurs fan, I'm so CHI that you'd think I'm bashful  2) Kawhi + LMA won 61 games and hung tough with the snek era warriors in the regular season, not to mention being up BY 25 POINTS IN the first game of their series with the warriors before zaza's dirty play. Now you add LeBron James, the 2nd best player of all time, to that? Take some of the offensive load off of him and add some defensive backbone so he can do his free safety thing? That team beats the Warriors in 6 or 7. Don't doubt it would be tough, but a LeBron-Kawhi-LMA Spurs with Pop coaching would be the best team in the league"
well i think that Lebron wont do so good.. lol sorry.. im not hatin im juss sayin what i feel.. hah.. i think that carmelo anthony is a way better palyer then lebron james.. i mean c'mon leborn and his team didnt make it to the playoff's and both years melo has been wit the nuggets they made it.. whats up with that.. if leborn was suppsodly the rookie of the year back in '03-04.. psstt.. news flash it should been melo.. he was A WAY BETTER PLAYER then james.. but thats what i think...

"Because KD --&gt; GSW has the whole ""if you can't beat em, join em"" narrative. When you win one year, lose the next year, it implies more of an even matchup.  But more importantly is the timeframe. GSW knocked KD out, he joined them months later. They just aren't comparable situations, the last time Lebron played the Spurs in the playoffs was 4 years ago.  It'd be like James Harden joining GSW in the offseason. The best player on the their biggest competition joining after having a series lead. People would understandably go crazy. But people wouldn't care as much if he joined in 2022, after not facing them in the playoffs for 4 years."
"Lebron means king, King James = Lebron James. You should know this bro. Plus I’ve never heard him call himself ‘King James.’"
So what I'm hearing is that it doesn't matter what team LeBron goes to next if he doesn't have James Jones
James Johnson would be the LeBron of that league.
I was playing NBA 2K18 and was using Ruby James Jones destroying someone with Pink Diamond Lebron and the thought just popped into my head. I knew Lebron never won a ring without James Jones just from watching NBA than I looked up all the years they were teammates that’s how I found out.

"Hmmm I can partially agree to it. I often have conversations like this with those who only saw him in the 90s. I grew up wit dudes who hated Mike in the 80s n 90s, now swing from his nuts.    That's what happens when you get that legend status, people seem to 'forget' that bad parts of your career.

"
"&gt;Leonard and James in LA seems likely if Leonard wants out  So your post is STATING that, if Leonard wants out, it's likely he and Lebron team up in LA. Let's see how that happens  &gt;If Leonard wants out of San Antonio, I don't see how they say no Lonzo Ball straight up  Leonard wants out of San Antonio, every single team starts calling the Spurs giving them offers. How the hell do they say no to Lonzo Ball straight up though  &gt;Especially, if Leonard tells any other team that he won't re-sign with them next summer.  The Spurs don't really give a shit about this, but the other teams do. So they low-ball the Spurs, but there's still a shitload of teams trying to out-bid each other, knowing that, if they can compete, there's a good chance Kawhi stays, even though he said he wouldn't resign. I don't know how this is so hard to understand. It's not like the Kings are trading for him knowing he'd get the fuck out of there. Plenty of teams would take a risk.  So your whole post is operating under the assumption that Kawhi Leonard wouldn't, under any fucking circumstances, even if the fucking Warriors called and traded him for Klay, want to play for any other team other than the Lakers in this hypothetical scenario. And then you call it likely. But I'm ridiculous."

"He's 2-1 against lebron. Yeah I get it kd's in a super team and lebron isn't. But let's not pretend James didn't win chips with kyrie, love, Wade and bosh... his own super teams. "
"THIS.  LeBron rubbed a lot of people the wrong way coming out of high school. The gospel choir Nike ads, The Chosen One tattoo he got before playing an nba game, the constant sports center commercials....then he actually not only backed it up but started exceeding the hype.  This is very much affected by age and to an extent race but I ain’t getting into that discussion (though I swear all fucking old white people outside Ohio hate LeBron). Basically I find people older than LeBron tend to be jealous and hate and root against him and those younger looked up to him, never really saw Jordan play, and think he’s the GOAT.  This tends to happen between generations however one thing that get lost is what made Jordan different was almost everyone, even his “haters” seemed to come around and agree he was better than Kareem, Russell, and the other GOAT contenders.  The other LeBron hate comes from every fan base east of the Mississippi.  It’s been a full decade of James pulverizing our collective testicles. As a Pistons fan, that 29 point performance is still the most gut wrenching sports moment of my life. Worse than losing game 7 to the Spurs. It was like he ripped my team’s heart out, ended my favorite era, and ushered in 12 years of mediocrity. He crushed this franchise so hard I actually got SUPER excited for old ass AI, Ben fucking Gordon, and busted ass Blake Griffin. THAT’S HOW BAD HE FUCKED ME UP.  LeBron will go down as my favorite athlete to root against. I know I’m watching the second or third best player of all time at worst, an overall swell dude and great role model.  I want kids looking up to him.  I want him at the forefront of shaping this league for years to come. And I also want to see his heart ripped out every June because that’s what he did to me and seriously HOW DO YOU NOT SEND THE TRAP EVERY TIME AFTER 20 STRAIGHT POINTS GODDAMNIT FLIP"
They were a contender because of HIM Lmao. If that's the case Lebron left two contenders in The Heat and Cavs this year because he was in The Finals.   What help did Okc give Kd?By trading James Harden for Kevin Martin?  Kd usually had only one decent shooter if that on the roster and was playing with one of the most ball dominant players in the league who couldn't shoot and thrived anyway. Who on those Okc teams provided spacing other than Kd?   The Thunder getting as far as they did with Kd is teatament to his own greatness. That same Okc team he left struggled to get into the playoffs the year he left and the same team alongside a top 15 player in Pg and the MVP of the league barely made it into the playoffs this year. You guys are blinded by hate and probably wasn't even old enough to watch those Okc teams and are going by false narratives you see on the internet.
"I agree that sure, if there is only 1 pop might be it. However if player can be coachable only by select few coaches or if they figure whether to respect coach based on status or accolades etc, there is already a quite a big problem.  And over time I think James has shown this to be probably his single biggest weakness. So after seeing how he fitted under Blatt, I'm not that convinced that him going to play under Pop would be guaranteed sucess.  Not to say I don't want to see this experiment happen.  Also as side point, this is why I feel quite fine about how GSW is doing. While they are good, it's not simply because they have all these high level players. They have made those high level players play team basketball to large extent. And while they do isolate, I think it's pretty clear that that's not their goal or primary option nor do their game look most effective through that. Also I think that pretty clearly taking Westbrook, Lebron and couple other all stars doesn't immediately mean = warriors.  I'm also really happy about NBA's current situation. I really like how Celtics, Pacers and some other teams as well played this year. So in that sense while it would be fun to see this happen, I'm not sure if I want one of the still relatively few team based org's in NBA possibly get ruined by Lebron."
"&gt; LeBron James responds by playing the best basketball of his career, including 40 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 138-101 win over the Hornets.  You don't need tragic accidents to make this happen"
"East has some decent teams but arent nearly half as exciting as the west especially if lebrons goes over there. Capela and Ariza have interest in moving from Houston and they could be a bit different looking next year. Depending where James, George, Kawhi and a few other FA, trades that can happen which makes the summer frenzy so much fun. Still looks like the Warriors league to lose unless Lebron creates another superteam. Hopefully the wont die out before the chip like it did this yr. There's some solid young teams being created that are still a few years out but this formula of smarter drafting, tanking, and GM moves has shaped up teams like Bucks, Jazz, Sixers, pelicans, nuggets, wolves and soon teams like the Lakers, kings, suns can be pretty good in a few more years. The fun part is the injection of quality rookies that are polished already or spend a year or 2 in the g league and come out hungry. It's been fun because as much as it looks the same at the end of the season, the roads there are getting tougher and more different every year. Were more privy to the front office info, draft stock, tryouts, now that everyone leaks has a camera or follows twitter/insta were tapped into the pulse of these developments. I'm all for banana boat 2.0 or burner fiascos."
Well Tim (not Pop) can prob talk to Lebron. Pop can talk about their plan for the summer even if they are targeting Lebron. They just can't talk to James directly for some time.

"Kobe stans are the most powerful as individuals, LeBron stans are the most powerful group.  Kobestans use ancient magics in an attempt to convince the world that their patron Saint is the one true God. Their tricks are a powerful sorcery, but they are rare and live either in seclusion or in the fabled Land of Angels. Time has stopped in that land, leaving them enternally locked in the past even as they pray for a new hero to come and break their curse.  LeBrontoism is the dominant religion in the land, as followers of the old Jordinian ways are deemed as backwards heretics blinded by the past. The purge has not been as complete as it was when the Jordinian way first rose and burned away the Chamberlites. The followers of that ancient religion are few and far between, hidden away in their secret temples until a great council to determine the GOAT is called.  r to the south, the renegade sect of Fundamentalists put their faith not in gods, but in men. The great leader Popovich instills in his men a fanatical loyalty that makes even mere mortals fight as though they were gods. Their last hero was cast down by a cruel fate, but he may yet rise again.  Far to the East, two rebel sects of LeBrontoism have started to emerge. Both have battled with the main religion for years and always fell, but with LeBrontoism in decline they have seen their opportunity to rise.   Now the dark shadow of the Golden Army looms over the land and the world recoils in terror. The God of LeBrontoism walks the earth once more, freed from the prison that was once his palace. He is the world's only hope against the Golden Army and every sect is calling for his aid.   The Kobestans seek an alliance with the LeBrontonians, hoping that their ancient magics and mythical ""cap space"" will draw heroes to them and battle the Golden Army. Their army is young and weak, but a hero may be all they need.  The Fundamentalists pray that the promise of Popovich's leadership will draw the heroes of the land to them. An army, led by the hero of LeBrontoism with the Fundamentalist hero by his side and the ever present guidance of the legendary Popovich could be enough to topple the scourge.  The Eastern sects call out for his aid as well, offering young and powerful warriors to support his effort. Though once considered enemies, the new and more powerful threat maybe be enough to settle their old fueds  With the world in peril, the fates of everyone lie on the shoulders on LeBron James and his devoted followers. They are surrounded by allies who can give them the support they need, but the specter of the Golden Army grows larger every day. Can the LeBrontonians make the right choice and save all the other lands from darkness?"

They get $25,000 for winning the gold medal, and they get given a per diem during the Olympics. Hardly a ""paid vacation.""   Wade: &gt; ""The biggest thing is now you get no rest,"" Wade said. ""So you go to the end of the season, [Team USA] training camp is two weeks later. You're giving up a lot to do it. It's something you want to do. But it's taxing on your body.

Kobe on the '08 team:  &gt;“I’ll do whatever it takes,” Bryant said. “I just want to be on that team.”  &gt;“He was pressing everybody,” Boeheim said of Bryant. “He’s just jumping all over guys screaming, going after everybody and getting everybody to do that, too.

No kidding. I could tell that at the final buzzer, when 12 filthy rich grown-ups began to celebrate like Little Leaguers. No posturing, fake crying or rehearsed dance routines, just hugging and more hugging. We wanted a selfless team that cared. We wanted a team to come through when it mattered. We wanted one unforgettable game. We got all of it—well, those of us paying attention, anyway.  "

"I know Blatt had success in Europe but he was not in a good spot in Cleveland. Remember that he signed before bron went back, he was supposed to help grow a team with Kyrie, not contend immediately. He wasn't ready for it, someone (I believe windhorst) reported that he'd do stupid shit like draw up plays during timeouts for guys that weren't in the game yet. There was that Chicago playoff game that he almost lost because he forgot how many timeouts there were.   Most people in this sub have probably never had real jobs, so let me tell you as an old ass man that it sucks working with anyone who is not on your level. Top companies will fire VPs after a couple months if they can't hang. And it's really easy for me to imagine that a first year Blatt, making rookie mistakes like that, couldn't hang with LeBron, perhaps the greatest basketball mind ever.     Edit: some examples, wasn't Windy  ""Word circulated to cleveland.com that Blatt had trouble drawing up plays out of timeouts. He would freeze up and waste precious seconds, one player said. He would even draw up plays for players who weren't in the game, another player said.  In the closeout game of the Eastern Conference Finals, a game the Cavaliers trounced the Atlanta Hawks by 30 to sweep the series; Blatt had signaled for Tristan Thompson to reenter in the closing minutes with the game already wrapped up. This was when Thompson was the team's most valuable big man with Kevin Love out of commission with a dislocated shoulder.  The bench couldn't believe it. They were shocked, as was Thompson, who never questions authority. LeBron James told Blatt to put somebody else in the game, out of concern a key cog might get hurt before The Finals, a league source said. Kendrick Perkins got the nod, and a few minutes later, Brendan Haywood's number was called to finish it out.""  https://articles.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2016/01/why_david_blatt_got_fired_and.amp    "

"In terms of ratios, Earl Boykins : Chris Paul :: Chris Paul : LeBron James.  It’s incredible if you think about it - Earl Boykins was so tiny relative to normal NBA players that a guy like Chris Paul, who’s often otherwise the smallest guy on the court, is like LeBron James to him."
"Are you guys not privy to where LeBron family lives, or...? Nothing is wrong with San Antonio. LeBron's family just isn't interested.

Stop getting butthurt that **his** family has not brought your place up in their life plans once. I'm from Sacramento. I've lived in Atlanta. I call New York city home. Outside of NYC, his camp never even mentioned those places as locations he'd even like to play against, much less for. I'm just stating the facts. No one in his family has once made a mention or shown any interest in wanting to be in San Antonio. So, their chances are a long shot (even though if you ask me, the best shot).

"Why DON’T you care?   I believe EVERYONE should get their fair market value. Not just Lebron James. I believe in fair compensation for fair labor. Apparently you don’t.   The Kyle Korver’s are the backbone of the league. The league can survive without its Lebron Jameses. Someone like an Oladipo would fill the gap. The league however cannot survive without its Korvers. They make up more than 99% of the labor force. And you need quality role players to have quality *team* basketball. If all players get paid their fair market value, that means more people will want to play in the NBA which not only attracts more talent, but those prospects could in turn become super stars and better role players. Better compensation is good for the NBA. Otherwise, why aren’t we watching 1 on 1 instead of 5 on 5? "
"If you consider these the same then I can't even debate with you. LeBron going to a Miami team that wasn't great. It had Dwayne Wade and added LeBron James and Chris Bosh. They had no idea how it would turn out.            Kevin Durant joined a team that had gone to back to back finals, had already won one of them, broke the single season win record, had 3 top 15-20 players already and their best player was coming off back to back MVPs. The team he had down 3-1 and then couldn't finish off. So they add the second best player in the world. Now they have 2 top 5 players and 4 top 20 players. We knew the outcome this finals 2 years ago.             I get why he did it but he lost any chance of ever getting the respect that LeBron and Jordan have. Hell he doesn't even deserve the same type of respect Curry deserves. He is a great player but he will never be in the conversation as those other guys because his legacy is built upon joining a team that didn't need him and trying to take credit for what was already going on for 2 years without him. A historic team before him so he didn't raise them up from nothing he simply just climbed on for the ride."
"Right, but without Chris Paul I think the Celtics take at least one game on the road. Giving them home advantage over the Rockets.  And the Cavaliers well they have LeBron James. "
&gt;I respect Lebron James the basketball player. I don't respect Lebron James the competitor. He's a grown man who can do whatever the fuck he wants as long as he's fine with the consequences. My main issue is that he wants to have it both ways. You can't make a move like that and still expect people to believe you are a hardcore competitor. Just own the fact that you were tired of almost winning and wanted to a surefire path to a championship  Are you going to say this when Lebron does the same thing this summer? Or do you expect Lebron to play for shitty teams because it means more?
"Being a franchise player also implies having a managerial dimension.  For better or worse, Jordan, Duncan, Bryant or Lebron James are also defining their teams.

"Cmon man. He looked okay in 2016 but he’s shown absolutely nothing since, and that was when he was playing with Lebron James. What’s he gonna do playing with the damn hornets"
I find it ridiculous when people say Miami wasn't as much of a guaranteed situation. The only reason that team didn't win AT LEAST 3/4 championships was an all time horrific meltdown by LeBron James. The Heatles were ridiculously stacked.
People are quick to judge KD but... look at Lebron this fucking year. People remind us EVERY FUCKING DAY that anyone NOT Lebron James would not have done as much as that man did this year.... but you also want KD to fucking do it as well? KD isn't on Lebrons level to do that... period. 
Here's the actual source:  [LeBron James says it would be amazing to play for Popovich in 2020 Tokyo Olympics](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/rio-2016/2016/08/20/lebron-james-gregg-popovich-2020-tokyo-olympics-usa-basketball/89043016/)
I've said this before and I'll say it again. Kevin Durant played for the Oklahoma City thunder an organization that consistently put a team together for him to compete with. Okc had a core of kd Westbrook ibaka and harden for a couple years before the thunder traded away harden which was a mistake. But that organization continued to put pieces together to compete and they did. They made the wcf almost every year besides the 2 years kd and Westbrook were out. Fast forward to the 2016 playoffs. The thunder went on a historic run which culminated in them being up 3-1 against a 73 win team. KD proceeded to jag away the final 3 close out games. If KD can play well to close out those games he gets back to the finals to play a Cleveland team that I think he would've beaten. Then in the off season this man signed with the team he was just up 3-1 on and it leaked that he had burner twitter accounts where he was trashing his teammates. Listen if kd wanted to leave an organization that consistently put him in the position to succeed time and time again that's on him but to join the 73 win team you were bout to beat who were also 2 minutes away from a championship is soft as shit and by far worse than bosh wade and bron joining up. Lebron James played for the cavs who from 2003-2010 did not put talent around lebron to be successful. They gave him the corpses of shaq and Antwan Jamison. Chris bosh played in Toronto during there let's drink bleach days. Wade had won a championship his 2 year in the league but was finding difficulty winning anything the following years. Individually they couldn't get past the Celtics who were the top dogs in the east. Together they did struggle to beat the Celtics and ran into trouble with the pacers. The decisions of kd and lebron are not the same. Kd played with an MVP and 6th man of the year. Lebron has fuckin mo Williams.

It’s not KD’s fault GSW lived up to the expectations, and the Heat didn’t.   This is all revisionist history that Lebron going to the Heat was somehow very different. Lebron tried to take the same road KD did. It just didn’t work out the same (still very good, but nowhere near expectations).

People are speculating on LA or San Antonio but what would really surprise me is if Lebron James came out as gay during his interview.
"Celtics could do a sign and trade:  Cavs get:  2019 1st Round pick (from Sac, only #1 protected ), 2019 1st Round Memphis pick, 2019 Clippers 1st round pick.

Then trade Kyrie for more players."
"I don't think many people on this planet can compare their sports situations with having a LeBron James on their team. The guy is literally bigger than the sport. Definitely bigger than the Cavs and of course, bigger than their coach. I agree that LeBron isn't running the schemes but he can and does override anything that Lue comes up with. "

They would've ran through the entire league that first year if Lebron didn't disappear in the Finals. Everyone knew they'd destroy in the playoffs."
"Wherever Lebron goes, I go. Call me a bandwagon if you want, but I refer to myself as someone who respects and follows greatness.

"this is different and you know it. KD didn't beat Kenyon Martin he beat LeBron James who is one of the most talked about players of all time. These finals will be talked about forever in terms of KD's legacy and LeBron's legacy.  To this day people rewatch Jordan's finals and ESPN, TNT, ABC, Bleacher Report ect share and reshow Jordan's finals moments over and over again all year every year why do you think that after they retire LeBron and KD won't get similar treatment.  Why are you shitting on Westbrook? He'll be remembered for winning MVP and averaging a triple double in two seasons. If people still talk about the Big O averaging a triple double 57 years ago I'm pretty sure Westbrook will still be remembered for his play.  When people rank all time players at least for the next 20 years when they think about putting KD ahead of another All Time Great they will take a look at their accomplishments and find him slightly lesser because of it.   For example if someone tries to put KD past Larry Legend they will see they both have multiple rings and finals MVPs but Larry did it on the team that drafted him against all time great competition whereas KD joined the team that beat him. It's like if Larry had joined up with Magic instead of trying to beat him. I really think people will remember that"

That’s literally the exact opposite of their roles as President and Vice-President of the NBPA. Taking paycuts as the leadership of the Players Association is the last thing either of these players would ever do. The whole league and the collective livelihood trickles down from the value of the super max contract of LeBron James. The pressure from owners leveraging wages downward against the other 100+ players renegotiating wages increases twofold. He’s the leadership and he’s the best player in the league shopping his talents out. I don’t know how you could even think that BOTH of them would do this just to play TOGETHER to “get a ring.” They’d be ousted so quickly from their positions and get blackballed because the domino effect of their contracts would cost the player collective millions and millions of dollars. This is so stupid.
"If you want to watch a contender every year, just follow the team Lebron James goes to this offseason "
I don't understand this narrative. He just had his most impressive playoff run ever [in terms of numbers](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/lebron-james-player-stats?seasonType=2)   and in terms of who he had to drag along with him. How can anyone say hes lost a step?  His regular season numbers are down but I have no doubt it's simply from him coasting to preserve his energy for the playoffs.  Help me understand why people have this point of view. 
"In what universe is Larry Bird a better player than LeBron James? Bird is probably in my top 5, definitely top 10, but come on. "
Not to James Harden or LeBron.   Off the dribble shots is all about rhythm and you can also use momentum to get your shot off and for some you don’t need to have great form because the momentum allows you to shoot with your shoulders or wrist and not drive the energy through your body like catch and shoots require your form to be consistent and automatic. It’s a jr smith thing.

"• Him only having 1 MVP is the most stupid argument of all time. Winning MVP does not mean you are/were the best player. If it did only Shaq, Duncan, Kobe and Lebron would have won it for the last 20 years. Nash has 2 MVPs, Kobe and Shaq only have 1. Is he better than either? Absolutely not. Harden and Westbrook are not better than Lebron James yet they will have the last 2 MVPs. It’s an award for the most impressive statistical season, nothing more, except for a few exceptions. The 2 years that Nash won it Kobe was the best individual player in the league. Nash’s teammates have said so themselves.  • I’m expecting the Lebron brigade to bombard me with stats like this. They mean absolutely nothing without context. Anyone can cherry pick stats and present them on there own without any context to make any argument they want to make. Stats, accomplishments, titles all combined should make up a players all time ranking but only with context, that’s the most important thing. Like the stupid Kobe ball hog narrative, people talk about the 81 point game and 63 in 3 quarters game as examples but leave out the details and the context. They neglect to mention that in the 81 point game his teammates shot less than 40% and that they were down double figures even in the third despite his heroics.  • Shaq was an incredible player and absolutely was vital to his initial success. But Shaq didn’t win without him, couldn’t win without him and wouldn’t have without him. Likewise Kobe wouldn’t have won without him either. They needed each other. I’ll give you the first finals, Shaq was definitely A and Kobe B, but after that they were 1A and 1B. As for who’s the better player? It’s Kobe. Shaq went on to play with D Wade, he played with Lebron he played with the loaded Celtics squad for a short while and only won 1 more title. Kobe won 2 more and went to 3 straight finals, through the loaded West and only had Pau Gasol, who i’ll get to in a second.  • I could find sporting websites and publications that have Kareem at the GOAT or Lebron. It doesn’t mean that they are.  • All we’ve heard all year is how bad Lebron’s team is. During Kobe’s prime he had the worst supporting cast any other top player has ever had. And it’s not even close. Even Lebron’s early Cavs teams had more. During his prime Kobe averaged 35/6/6, that’s superhuman. And is, frankly, under appreciated.  PG: Smush Parker SG: Kobe SF: Chris Mihm PF: Lamar Odom C: Kwame Brown.  That’s awful. Take out Kobe and that team doesn’t win 10 games. That fact that he dragged their sorry asses to the playoffs at all is a miracle in itself. So yeah, he did strop up 3-1 against the Suns and lose the series, because he had to do everything himself to a ridiculous degree. A Suns team by the way that was absolutely fantastic and no he didn’t do anything before he got Pau but nobody would have.   Speaking of Pau Gasol. Now before I start, I’d like to say that I love Pau for obvious reasons. I have a framed Pau jersey on my wall at home. But he is quickly becoming one of the most overrated players in NBA history. Before he got with Kobe he’d won ROTY his first year and had a 20/10 season once, that’s it. Kevin Love averaged 21/12 through games 1-3 on this years finals and is being blasted for his performances. Pau never sniffed an All Star game before he got with Kobe, never even sniffed 3rd team all NBA. People discredit Chris Bosh and downplay how good of a player he was and how much he helped Lebron. But Chris Bosh had more all star appearances than Pau Gasol and had better career averages. Now i’m not saying that Bosh is better but the gap between them is small at best. Pau was never, ever better than the 4th best PF in the league. I’d argue K Love is around about that now, put Lebron and K Love with some below average role players in the west and see what happens. Pau is not close to Dirk, not close to Duncan and yet people act like he is. He was an all star level player when he played with Kobe. Wasn’t before that."

Four all stars are not as good as two all stars plus Lebron James 
"Paul George doesn't fit the scheme LeBron James plays. He will just clog the middle more, forcing James to shoot more than attacking the rim. Kemba Walker trade COULD happen. If these trades did happen, the Cavs would have no depth. They would be trading all depth for a lateral movement(if not downgrade) at PF, a pretty big upgrade at PG, and a slight upgrade at SG. However, they would lose all depth on a team already starving for depth"

"As a Philly fan, here is where I see Philly's best qualitys:  Lots of cap to sign LeBron without really gutting the team. I'm pretty sure we could mostly sign LeBron without touching anyone currently undercontract or maybe moving one piece. That prevents the team from being ""gutted"" like would happen in a Houston trade  Youth which would allow LeBron to compete for several years even after he begins declining (he can be Alpha for the next few years then help guide Joel/Ben/Markelle(?) to lead the team)  He's friends with Ben which is really dumb, I know, but he basically gave James Jones an NBA job for over half a decade cause he liked him. If he really likes Ben as much as it seems, that might draw him here.  He has expressed an interest in playing off-ball and between Ben and Markelle, the Sixers have two really good young passers who could really help him coast in that off-ball cutting role he claims to want.  I don't think Philadelphia is a certainty to be clear. I'm a Philly fan after all and, even with the Eagles SB win, I'm conditioned to expect the worst at all times. That said, I think that - unless he has a concoted plan ready with PG13 and Kawhi - we make the second most sense.   Houston would make the most sense because LeBron believes that him + CP3 + Harden + a brilliant Morey bench can beat the Warriors. I think Philly is slightly ahead of the Laker thanks to performance - again barring any PG13 deal. Anywhere else involves too much assumption and/or trading for Lebron to be fully comfortable I think. Though as I mentioned in a comment, I think that a Toronto team with Lebron would be really freaking good."
"I don't think he comes here because he wants final appearances in the east since it's easier, but Toronto would be legit because they have a great team and are in the east, could beat Boston/Philly next season.   But cap issues are a problem. Also it's Canada, no disrespect -- I don't think a superstar in our lifetime openly goes to Toronto over 28 other NBA cities in the US with 9 of them being legit attractions.  [Chris Haynes also said Toronto is a dark horse at signing LeBron.](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/250122/Raptors-Mentioned-As-Potential-Dark-horse-For-LeBron-James)"
"To be honest with you I don't recall any truly tightly defended shots the Cavaliers role players made. All I remember on that front were their shooters getting the ball in their spots with the nearest defender a mile away, followed by late rotations and/or contests. Also, things like Korver shooting over Lowry and VanVleet like they're not even there, Love successfully posting up CJ Miles for six straight minutes. So the ""tightly defended shots"" stats could be real wonky as a result of that, but who knows.  In any case I remember all these open shots were a product of haphazardly doubling LeBron James almost every single possession without proper rotations, which allowed him to pick apart the Raptors' defense with pinpoint passes to wide open shooters. [begin rant here] I know people like to complain that guarding LeBron James in single coverage is a disaster. Well guess what, leaving three point shooters to double team LeBron James is an even bigger disaster. And you do that over and over again, all those threes are going to add up. You have to pick your poison? At least shut down the role players for god's sake. Nate McMillan and the Pacers put out the blueprint for slowing down the Cavaliers this year, which means there was zero reason for a better team like the Raptors to get roasted so badly. I think the Raptors' defense totally crumbling against the Cavaliers was a problem mostly rooted in terrible defensive schemes (too much unnecessary switching, doubling LeBron James way too much when lengthy OG Anunoby did a great job limiting his playmaking anyways) and poor matchups (CJ Miles on Kevin Love, DeRozan not giving a fuck about defending anyone, too much cement-footed Ibaka, two minutes of Bebe just so Casey wouldn't have to play JV, etc.) which played right into the hands of the Cavaliers. I think mentality is part of the problem too, but I don't think that have the same effect that proper matchups and better defensive schemes would have given the Raptors. [end rant here]  Getting swept again is embarrassing and frustrating as hell, like ""How the FUCK did that even happen?"" kind of embarrassing and frustrating as hell. And it's pretty easy to say things like ""LeBron James is just too good"" and ""Cleveland's role players turn into All-Stars against the Raptors"", but I think there's a lot of little and tiny yet significant underlying factors, factors that could have been adjusted and fixed easily and helped the Raptors be more competitive and actually win games. Like why do Cleveland's role players turn into All-Stars against the Raptors? Maybe it's because the Raptors gave them a ton of open shots to feast on? Maybe because there's too many defensive weak links in the Raptors roster? Things like that."

"The Sixers would be huge, talented, and smart. They were a great defensive team and led the league in passes per game, and would be adding Lebron James. The number of passes would probably go down but the scoring would certainly go up. I dont think LBJ would be in God-mode at all times dominating the offense, he would love to  have guys like Simmons/Embiid to lean on and a coach like Brett Brown.  Im not saying that theyre gonna run constant pnr’s and stagnant posting of Curry, but that in the flow of their offense theyd be too huge for the Warriors to contain in addition to a stifling defense. Covington/Lebron would be the shortest player in the lineup (or 6’4 Fultz if he steps up) and they all have some beef to them that always gives the Warriors trouble, with Embiid owning Draymond. You say they struggle with defensive rebounding... they would get pounded on the glass by Simmons/Embiid/Saric/Lebron and Covington is sneaky + Fultz a strong rebounder.  Factoring in improvement from all their young guys, theres just too many ways for them to abuse their size advantage against GS. Small ball vs big ball (but just as skilled). "

"We may just have to agree to disagree. I think you'd have a point if we were talking about any GM not named Ainge  and any player not named Lebron James.  &gt;I'm not saying it would be the end of Brad's relationship with the Celtics, all I'm saying is that, combined with the horrific optics of trading a star player after he got injured 5 minutes into his first game after he signed with you, Hayward is almost as untouchable as Tatum.  Danny Ainge does not care about optics. He's traded IT, Rondo, Pierce, and KG without a second thought and all of those players meant more to Boston and the Celtics than Hayward did. Ainge does what's best for the team and that's it. Also the part about being untouchable should end when Lebron James, the best player in the world, is on the table. We'll see how it goes tho.  Edit: also idk how we'd have to worry about free agents after getting LBJ. We'd be capped out for the foreseeable future so I'm sure many people would forget about it the next time we have a shot at signing free agents. Also ring chasers/ players that want to increase their value with Brad will still fuck with us. And if a free agent held against us that we traded our prior free agent for Lebron fucking James then I don't want that player signing for the Celtics.   "

"Chris Paul.  Lebron.  James Harden.   Their stats overrate their impact, so they’re really only overrated by those that think individual stats represent performance.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

You did a solid job by *trying* to thread the needle, but it just isn't possible all things considered."

Only talk with his jersey covering his mouth.  Definitely gonna need the ""King James"" jersey to be worn, along with the Batman mask.  Score on at least 5 Wade to James oops.  Convert on at least 6 jab step jumpers.  At least one chase down block.  Score 62 pts.  Cross the ft line before his shot is in the cylinder every time.

That was top 10 in the league in assists per game with better TS% than almost anyone (including LeBron James), and elite rebounding.  He took the leap. He was absolutely dominant to end the season.

"More assists =/= better passing. John Wall isn’t a better passer than LeBron James.  The Bucks barely pass. At all. Even in OKC they moved the ball around, they didn’t go to Westbrook and KD alternating isos until the end of games.

That Rondo/LeBron type shit, where nobody else would even see it and even if they did they still couldn’t pull it off. You go and find a highlight reel of Giannis passes and I guarantee KD would never be able to pull half that shit off."

"Friendly reminder the CBA’s intention is not to create parity. The CBA’s primary mission is to create a business model (notice I did not say playing model) that meets the needs of the players and owners alike.  The NBAPA is arguably the best union in sports and has managed to get guaranteed contracts. That’s NEVER going away unless the owners offer up something too good to pass up in return (Think the abolishment of Restricted FA + More).  The CBA allows for salary cap exceptions in an effort to persuade players to stay with their original teams by allowing the original team to offer longer and greater contracts (again, fully guaranteed) ... If the contracts were no longer fully guaranteed, you’d see every player signing 1+1 or 2+1 contracts like LeBron and KD. So where you see guaranteed contracts hurting the way the game is played on the court, I’d argue they’re helping because players like James Harden and Russ Westbrook can sign long-term deals and allow their teams the continuity and time to grow and evolve into a championship contender.

"Jordan in the 1st 5 seasons of his career only took 50 something 3's. Then in the 89-90 season, he took 50 something 3's in that season alone. The 3 point shot just wasn't as important back then as it is now.  Regardless, Jordan's 3PT shooting is barely worse than Kobe or Lebron's.    Now midrange (i.e shots from 10 ft &lt; 3pt line) are a different story. Jordan was in a league of his own:    Jordan shot in the 50% FG from midrange. Jordan truly is the best midrange shooters of all time. Elite midrange shooters in today's game by comparison, (midrange here defined as shots from 10ft &lt; 3pt line)   Durant : 44.3 FG% from midrange for his career (per basketball reference)  Nowitzski : 47.5 FG % from midrange  Chris Paul : 46.7 FG% from midrange  Steph Curry : 46.1 FG% from midrange    The two biggest names since Jordan  Kobe Bryant : **42 FG%** from midrange  LeBron James: **37.6 FG%** from midrange  And yet some people will claim that Kobe and even more ridiculously Lebron are comparable shooters to Jordan because of decimal point differences in 3PT %.   Jordan's 3PT% is actually even better than both Kobe's and Lebron's in the playoffs last I checked"
Only Lebron James Jr or Luka Doncic
"Wall is completely capable of being a good defender when he doesn’t have to do so much. Lebron with one all stat couldn’t take a game because one of his teammates made one of the dumbest plays in NBA history and his one other all star gets abused by every warrior on the roster.  Curry and KD can’t be contained but wall and porter are about as good as you can get to have defending them. Beal can also do about as good of a job on klay as you can hope for. I definitely wouldn’t pick lewizards over them but I wouldn’t be shocked considering that 1) it’s LeBron James and 2) the warriors have already shown mental fatigue and withering hunger to win, which should only get worse next year. This isn’t to say that the warriors won’t be hungry again next year, but I could see lewizards out dogging them and the warriors(mainly curry) getting fucked by no calls again.   Back to the Celtics, getting players back doesn’t mean you can just add their production on top of whatever you already have. Hayward is gonna have to eat into someone’s(tatums and browns to some extent) minutes as is Kyrie. Hayward is still better than those guys so you should be better next year, but it’s questionable just how much better you will be. Meanwhile lewizards is just way better in every aspect than the Cavs were this year."
Lebron “James Hard”
"Ideally, every other player on the floor can shoot. If Lonzo is on the perimeter and LeBron is driving the lane, I know what I'm doing as the team on defense: doubling LeBron and forcing the kick out to the man shooting 30.4% from 3 this season.  I'll give Lonzo this: He's a good defensive guard. That will get him some credit, but he doesn't do enough offensively to justify why he's starting alongside LeBron James."
"I don't agree. LeBron plays best with guys who he can pass to and trust to hit a shot and Lonzo shoots .04% better than Marcus Smart does from 3.   Why is the ball ever in Lonzo's hands anyway if LeBron is on the floor? Unless LeBron is sprinting around the floor cutting and going up for lobs, why neuter your offense by giving the ball to Lonzo and not LeBron James?  If LeBron joins the Lakers, Lonzo should be the first piece shipped out."
"Utah would play them tough for sure, but I really don't think Jae Crowder can do anything about LeBron James in playoff mode."
"breakign news, cavs interested in anyone to play with lebron james"
"TL;DR - See previous TL;DR.  So if NBA rosters are maxed at 15, but you have 60 players with the autonomy to decide that they only want to play for the Lakers, what do you do about the other 58-59 players who can't be accommodated?   What is your specific criteria for determining which of those 60 players gets their wish, and joins the Lakers?   Inevitably, *someone* is going to have to go into a small market rebuild. If they don't, the small market *will never have the means to rebuild.*  And the salary cap is irrelevant to my point about money -- if you're good enough to play a season in the NBA, there is a *minimum sum of money upwards of $500,000* that you will be paid. If the team can't afford you, they'll ship you off to a team which can, or they'll assign you to the G league, where you're still making $35,000, *plus housing* benefits. That's right -- your rent doesn't have to come out of your $35,000. That's a courtesy I don't get from my employer.  And how does recruiting younger talent for cheaper work? Recruit as a verb implies *compulsory service*. That's... what a ""draft"" *is.* If you can't *compel* a draftee to play for your team, you... can't... *recruit*.  This turns into a game where as a team, you can recruit (compel) young players to play for you for cheap, unless the players you wish to recruit (compel) decide that, nah, *they* aren't **bound by the same rules**, and don't have to join the team because they don't want to. In which case, *you actually don't have the ability to ""recruit"" the players you want, you can only ask them nicely if they'll grace your team with their presence.*  And the part I bolded about ""bound by the same rules"" -- if, for consistency's sake, *every player in the draft* has the freedom to decide where they will/won't be drafted, then teams in fact do not have the ability to recruit **any** young players, **for any price**. Again, they only have the ability to ask them nicely if they'll join.  And that's absurd. If I'm Ryan McDonough (Suns GM), why should I be expected to ask 	Jarred Vanderbilt to join my team, because DeAndre Ayton decided he's only available to be ""drafted"" by teams that aren't the Suns?   DeAndre Ayton maybe helps move the rebuild along. Jarred Vanderbilt will probably be in Turkey by 2023. Instead, because I can't actually recruit the player who I've decided best suits my needs, I'll just make a run at Ed Davis or Trevor Booker. Are they more expensive? Yeah. But they've played in the league. They're known quantities, so you can gameplan with their average contributions roughly in mind.  DeAndre Ayton and Jarred Vanderbilt have established no such track record in the NBA, so if I can't get the consensus surefire guy, I'm not wasting my time and money on a draft pick who will, in all likelihood, be a complete nonfactor in the league.  And guess what? Ryan McDonough isn't the only GM who's going to do this -- no GM in their right mind is going to *ask* some 2nd round college kid to play for them. They're going to spend a bit more to get vets, and 50-55 draft 'prospects' will end up **unemployed**, because a bunch of entitled-before-their-time kids decided that *they* get to call the shots in a league that **they're not even part of yet.**  It's just weird mental gymnastics trying to make a draftless draft be a feasible thing. It creates a whole slew of new problems, without solving any old ones.  Frankly, require players have played 2 years at college. Disband AAU, or at least disqualify AAU players from going pro.  We need to stem the flow of 18 and 19 year olds coming into the league, not encourage more. It dilutes what is supposed to be a *professional* league, by turning it into college 'juniors' and 'seniors' injuring themselves and flaming out trying to compete with a few superstars like LeBron, or a few superteams like GSW.  Can you develop talent? Yes, to an extent. But more college/AAU players need to realize just how unbelievably *unlikely* it is that they'll actually be decent players at (what is supposed to be) the professional, best-in-the-world level. More people need to be encouraged to pursue more realistic life goals.  I mean, there's really no universe where LeBron James and Lorenzo Brown should be playing in the same league, but here we are.

This was part of a bigger ESPN campaign to give local artists a shot at bringing LeBron to their team. The art was put on a billboard.  http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/23726047/billboard-top-30-how-every-team-pitch-lebron-james-free-agency-nba  My favourite is probably Denver's and Boston's :D
"How do they not? They're both players who are most lethal when driving and have good passing ability but aren't very effective playing off-ball or spreading the floor. Trust me, if Giannis or LeBron James are taking a 3 pointer, the defense is thinking ""Phew. If they hit that, we'll live with it."" every single possession will be like that.   Plus milwaukee's roster behind Giannis and LeBron wouldn't be any good anyway. How are they matching salary to trade for LeBron? Then ask yourself who the third best player on that roster is and whether there are any top 50 players on the team besides Giannis and LeBron."
"Current team: Steph, DeRozan, LeBron, Giannis, AD.   Steph is extremely scary on the fast break, with the ball he can throw the oop, shoot from anywhere inside half comfortably and finish at the rim.... without the ball he going to space it and draw defender or two away from the player with the ball....  The rest can dunk over anyone pretty much....      All-Time: Magic, Dr.J, Bron, Big Game James n Chocolate Thunder as my trailer....."
I'm really hoping for Zach Lowe to take my post about how many babies LeBron James is worth and run with it.   No such luck.
"Breaking News: Sources say redditor believes Jordan Clarkson and Rodney Hood are ""good enough supporting cast"" for LeBron James."
"1. Wilt Chamberlain - 1961-62 - 50.4ppg/25.7rpg/48.5mpg - I don't know what's most impressive about this season to be perfectly honest. This is the only season that a player ever averaged 4,000 points,  one of only two seasons where a player had over 2,000 rebounds (guess who has the other one), or the fact that he averaged over 48 minutes per game. 2. Michael Jordan - 1987-88 - 35.0ppg/5.5rpg/5.9apg/3.2spg - Jordan's peak years were some of the greatest seasons of all time, but I think this one takes the cake. He averaged 2 less points per game this season compared to last, but his FG&amp;#37; shot up from 48&amp;#37; to 53&amp;#37;. He had an uptick in assists, and snatched over 3 steals a game. This season, he won his first MVP award and his only DPOY award. Truly one of the greatest seasons in NBA history. 3. LeBron James - 2012-13 - 26.8ppg/8.0rpg/7.3apg/56.5&amp;#37; shooting/40.6&amp;#37; from 3 - Before there was 2015-16 Steph Curry, there was 2012-2014 LeBron. I chose his 2012-13 season because it was astonishing that LeBron, previously touted as a pretty poor mid to long range shooter, pushed his 3P&amp;#37; up over 40&amp;#37; while shooting an insane 56.5&amp;#37; from the floor overall. It's hard to pick out a peak season for him because he basically does his signature 27/7/7 year in and year out, but I would argue that his time on the Heat was where LeBron's physical and mental peaks overlapped."
"C'mon man, old Spurs team who folks thought were all gonna retire against LeBron fucking in his prime James/ D-Wade (all star)/ Chris Bosh (all star)/ Ray Allen (top 2-3 shooter to this day). The team with better fundamentals and coaching won. Shot out to Ginobili. "

Yeah exactly. The way I like to think about Larry is he's basically less athletic but bettter shooting Lebron James ahead of his time. The fact that his career got cut off due to a freak back injury from paving his own driveway sucks mainly due to the fact that he could have been in the goat contention with a longer prime.

Cavaliers general manager David Griffin, however, ruled out Jackson as an option, aware of the issues within Jackson’s Warriors.  &gt;Thus, Tyronn Lue was the compromise choice for James and Paul, and they have been pushing for him to replace David Blatt since last season, and those calls intensified in the last few weeks.

Please explain how he will make extra money from endorsements if he wins a few more championships. He is already the most famous man in basketball history behind MJ.

"When is the last time LeBron James lost pretty easily to a team that wasn't great? The Jazz are good, they aren't best Lebron James easily good. They're not capable of doing what the Warriors did, they don't present as many matchup concerns, they don't have the same capability to abuse Kevin Love. The Jazz are a solid team, but they're limited, too. There are plenty of ways in which the Cavs could exploit them especially with Love's shooting working with Lebron.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime. Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball. Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game. So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better. You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that. This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"Thats why I don't see LeBron going to the rockets. They would have to let go of Clint, Trevor, Luc and Black. That is all their depth gone. Chris Paul would want 30m so will LeBron James which puts them with the other salary @ 78.6m+61m= 139m which is over the luxury tax by 16m.

Wes Matthews had the better of the two watch the 2016 first round Dallas vs OKC in particular   2) For Chris Paul and Steph Curry it's been Ricky Rubio past 5 years   3) For James Harden JJ Redick Andre Iguodala and Marcus Smart had the best data   JJ Redick from 2014-16 honestly had the best stats   4) For Dame Lillard again Luc Mbah Moute   5) For Kyrie Irving both Chris Paul and Klay Thompson have done well in the past   6) For Giannis Wes Matthews has done very well  7) Paul George defensively on DeMar DeRozan has very good stats traditionally  8) Both Kawhi Leonard and Avery Bradley have given Jimmy Butler his fair share of fits

If he developed a better handle, he could be comparable to LeBron tho i dont think hed ever be close to him in terms of distributing - its really just that at his size and in that era, he would have resembled what LeBron is doing to a degree, if he stayed in the post and worked on that, hed be comparable to Malone.

"They swept the NBA Finals.  Edit: Listen, if you're still here on June 19th and the Finals ended on June 8th, I understand you're a big basketball fan and hearing that the season is ""pointless"" is a tough pill to swallow. I didn't say that and I'm not suggesting basketball isn't as fun to watch, it surely is. But GSW+KD has provided the most competitive disparity we've seen in the NBA in at least 20 years. If at the start of this season, you didn't pick GSW to win (nevermind, sweep), you were on one.  * At the start of the season GSW odds to win were 7/5 followed by Cleveland at 6/1, Houston at 6/1, and Boston at 13/2.  That predictive model aligned with seemingly 95 percent of the popular opinion on here. * Lebron James made the finals like he has 8 consecutive years in a row. Same guy...Eight years. * GSW vs. Cavs occurred for the fourth year straight * GSW vs Houston felt like the ""*true""* NBA Finals * GSW *swept* Cleveland to cap off an 8-1 record against Cleveland in the past two years and a 16-6, 3 and 1 finals record vs the Cavs. That's dominant. * 2017 GSW became the third team to make the NBA Finals with an undefeated record. Their previous core had a 73-9 record and added Kevin Durant and it showed. * And lets not forget that GSW wasn't exactly firing on all cylinders entering the playoffs. Really, they were battling injuries for a good portion of the year and operated without Curry and Iguodala for swaths of this year's playoffs."

According to sources there's news of no news regarding LeBron James. We'll keep reminding you of this throughout the summer 
"This sums up the debate nicely. It depends on what measure you're defining the GOAT by and I think there's at least 3-4 ways to look at it. Most skill/physical ability as it translates to basketball, greatest peak, most sustained success, most wins added over a career, most championships added, some combination of these considering average performance and longevity? [This](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23456720/is-lebron-james-michael-jordan-greatest-nba-player-all) article by Kevin Pelton does a nice job comparing their careers by measuring championships added over their careers.   Basically Lebron was on pace to pass MJ in career championships added either this postseason or next year (not sure if he did, but considering his playoff run compared to past years, I bet he did). Whether or not you agree with how this is calculated, you still need to decide if you want to weight Jordan's insane peak or LeBron's insane longevity more. How much credit does LeBron get for playing at a high level for longer, even if Jordan's peak was higher than LeBron's? I'm alright with the answer to the debate being ""it depends"" because once you more specifically define what makes the GOAT, the answer becomes much more clear for most definitions."

"Have you not watched lebron at all over his career? When he was 22 he literally scored the last 25 points against the pistons in the playoffs to steal game 5.

Then theres game 6 versus boston  Game 5, 6, 7 versus the warriors two years ago  Game 1 against the warriors this year  Games 2 and 6 versus the pacers  Games 2 and 3 versus toronto  Game 6 versus celtics this year   And all that's just off of the top my head  To imply that lebron james cannot take over games is, in the words of the great steven A. Smith, **BLASPHEMY. WHAT IS WRRRRROOOONG WITH YOU?**"
"&gt;Honestly, I think the ""taking over games"" argument is really weak and generalized to focus only on scoring, and that's why a lot of casual fans not only blindly list Jordan as ""clearly"" better than James, but also can't fathom there being an objective argument that Lebron is statistically as impactful as Jordan was.       It's a lot more complicated than reducing it to ""casuals don't get it"". One of the most overlooked points of the statistical debate is that usage affects efficiency. LeBron is efficient, but is he as effective as MJ was?    That's where taking over the game really manifests itself, when you can impose your will on the game. LeBron did it to us a few times, and he is certainly able to do it, but he isn't as consistent about it as MJ was. Sometimes you get the sense that he's coasting, and that's why older players keep making the killer instinct comment. "
"&gt; did the Miami heat beforeLebron join, is still the miami heat that time he joined them? was that the 09-10 Heat plus Lebron James?  Obviously not. I'm saying it doesn't matter who you put around those players because they're so good they'll take you to the finals.  &gt; now you are getting out of the topic, oh please, the point is that the Warriors team before Durant join, and when he join is not the same...  Yeah and I'm saying the core of the team is basically the same, they just swapped Barnes for Durant and changed some of the bench players. And those bench players were going to change regardless of whether Durant went to the warriors."
"so now, we need to say that ""all fans"" are concerned jsut to say that fans are kinda concerned?  now you are getting out of the topic, oh please, the point is that the Warriors team before Durant join, and when he join is not the same...  did the Miami heat beforeLebron join, is still the miami heat that time he joined them? was that the 09-10 Heat plus Lebron James?"
"Dirk beat the Heatles with a old J.Kidd, Deshawn Stevenson, Jason Terry (he average more points in the Finals than LeBron James), an old Shawn Marion, Brian Cardinal and J.J fucking Barea.   Dirk was fucking insane. That 2011 Mavs team ended Bynum and Phil Jackson's career, started the end of Kobe's career and sent the Lakers in rebuilding mode (which they are still in) all in 4 games ."

SAS: it is reported Harden not recruiting LeBron James 
"Lebron James is a generational talent that you literally build your entire team around. I can't think of a single NHL free agent in the last 10 years who is at that level, since most teams will re-sign them (e.g. Crosby, Malkin, Ovechkin, McDavid). Most free agents are guys who you want to acquire to complement an existing elite talent on the team."
Pelicans acquire F LeBron James  Cavaliers acquire F Solomon Hill and a lifetime of beignets
"&gt; It's pretty rare in sports that a talent like Lebron James hits free agency.  As in best player in the sport, or as in generally a top 10 player? I agree with the former, not with the latter."
Lebron James is better and the Cavs will only get better in the off season.
It makes sense to me that the draft is before free agency.  Free agency is about augmenting your team. You only have a partial idea of what team you'll have post-draft since anything after a certain draft position is up in the air. There's also trades that happen during the draft.  It's pretty rare in sports that a talent like Lebron James hits free agency.  
Delonte West vs Lebron James jr.   Ron Artest vs Metta World Peace  Isaiah Thomas vs Isiah Thomas 
Let's dispel this fiction once and for all that LeBron James doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing; he's undergoing a systematic effort to change his effort and make his defense more like the rest of the league.
Whatever man it's totally because he's too ~~cheap~~ savvy [for ad free music streaming](https://factoryofsadness.co/2016/03/26/lebron-james-doesnt-pay-for-spotify/).
"Sh*t '12 has Peak Lebron, MVP Durant, James Harden right before he breaks out, Westbrook, and not fat Kevin Love, also Kobe was still 1st team All-NBA that season.   So it's Prime Wade vs MVP Durant... Wade was great but Durant is unguardable.   The redeem team was a better team, '12 would beat them in 7.    "
Think about how many people who have never watched or played basketball that know who LeBron James is though. You don't have to have an interest in something to know what it is.

"True what you said about flair, even if it doesn't really pertain to this OP.  With that in mind: Fuck the Cavs and LeBron.  (Kidding, mostly.  Playing, 100&amp;#37;) lol  We do live in a ~~society~~ world which has been forced into pure tribalism over the last two to three years, and this only amplifies through sports allegiances.  Everyone gets prejudged by the label they really didn't create for themselves but rather had to choose from a brief set of options someone else devised.  Bummer.  Best we seem to do these days is tolerate rather than celebrate.    About the OP, personally, I would like to see James try to do something other than cobble together a bunch of vets and take over entirely distrustfully of anyone else to achieve success, thus creating a massive achilles heel to be exploited by opponents: singular dimension, the same albatross that haunts Harden.  I'd like to see him truly mentor and grow as a player, even if deep down I think he actually isn't capable of it ***at all***.  I'm just saying it'd be nice to see him grow out of the same old persona he's cultivated for his entire career now.  Kobe couldn't do it.  Jordan wasn't exactly great at it in Washington, either.  Russell was, Duncan was.  But it is so rare, and that's kind of sad, I guess.  Think of how much James as a teacher could impact a group of young players rather than just James as an Alpha to be obeyed.  He's plenty smart and plenty good enough to accomplish this.  I've always felt he gave in to his fears in this respect.  No true trust in teammates.  Willingness to allow them to play, but more as a way of enabling himself than enabling them.  Yes, very good results.  I think the results could have and still could be so much better if he managed to learn to shift the paradigm.  Miami was the closest to this he ever came, because Bosh and Wade were strong men psychologically.  Even then it was not great. "

Let's all agree to meet back here in 10 years when the books are done and time has settled and we'll agree that the better player is Lebron James  Jr
Because DeRozan actually plays well there since he does not see LeBron James in front of him and poop his pants.

"Lol ok, so you've got Lebron James on a max, CP on a max, Kawhi/PG on or near a max... and then what? You're already, let's say, looking at 115 million dollars for 3 players. That's more than the entire Lakers roster got paid for the 2017-2018 season, and two of those hypothetical max-contract players are in their mid-30s. To keep ***just*** Brook Lopez and Luol Deng to round out a 5-man line-up, you'd be looking at over 150 million dollars. That's a non-viable plan right there for a full team, let alone just your starters."
"You're correct. People change the weighting of stats, accomplishments, longevity and signature performances depending on who they're arguing for.   I watched Jordan play. Since then besides James, imo only Shaq at his best has equaled, and even surpassed at times, the singular dominance of Jordan. I honestly don't know how you can have watched LeBron, compare him to Jordan, and not think it's close. "

"&gt;The N.F.L. logo — a ubiquitous red, white and blue shield, conveying some message of power or protection wrapped in the colors of the American flag — is the priority. All things are done in reverence to the shield. It is inanimate.  &gt;The N.B.A.’s logo has a person on it (the silhouette of Jerry West), and the image is fitting. It is a league of players, athletic and out front, and that is where the N.B.A. puts its public-relations focus.   This feels kinda stretchy   &gt;“LeBron James is a bigger brand than the Sacramento Kings,” the former N.F.L. player Trevor Pryce said. “Tom Brady is not as big a brand as the Cleveland Browns.”   Idk if I agree with this...The star power is definitely greater in the NBA but I don't think that makes statement 2 true.   I really feel like you could skip to the ""Sports' Political Map"" section and that's the most likely. The whole thing is an interesting read though! Thanks for sharing."

JJ Barea is already LeBron James in JJ Barea's body.
Your metaphor is jumbled. Is his uncle Palpatine or is Lebron? Obviously KD is Anakin. The Warriors are the Empire. Lebron is Obi Wan and James Harden the son of OKC is Luke. That is why Lebron is joining Houston.

So would Lebron James.  Your point is?
"&gt;Ok, but what about the other GM? They both agreed to the asset changing hands, thus the GM sending out that pick agreed to the other GM selecting whoever he selects, more or less.  It's an asset. The GM who traded away the pick was trading away the value associated with the selection options that are available with the pick. The GM acquiring the pick was acquiring an asset that had value associated with the selection options that are available with the pick.  Let's say the Warriors trade Durant, Curry and Thompson for three 2nd round picks. Their GM gets fired, and the guy who takes over uses those second round picks to select three players and then hires coaches that excel in player development, and the three players he selected with those second round picks all end up being better than Lebron James. Was it a good trade for that first Warriors GM to trade those three all stars for 2nd round picks? Was he responsible for selecting those three players? Was he responsible for developing them? Does he deserve credit for trading all stars for picks he could have gotten if he decided to deal bench players, just because the guys taken with those picks happened to develop into all time greats? Was it a bad trade for the GM who traded away the picks that were used to select players who all became better than every player he acquired in the trade?  &gt;He actively decided to give that pick away which, in turn, directly resulted in that player being selecting by the team who accepted the trade.  No, he actively traded an asset for another asset. It didn't directly result in anyone being taken. There are literally thousands of different players who could be selected with any pick. The GM that trades away the pick has no say in which of them ends up being chosen."
Demarcus Cousins to Washington  Otto Porter to Cleveland  LeBron James to New Orleans
Luka donicic is the most talented prospect to enter the nba draft since Lebron James. No doubt in my mind Luka will lead the Mavericks to the playoffs and possibly get to the wcf he’s a winner and that talented.
"I don't know, I think I'm a mix of LeBron James and Kevin Durant."
"I'm not assuming anything.  No major free agents have signed with Miami since that debacle.  That's just a fact.  You're the one saying there is no evidence that screwing Wade hurt their reputation, yet there is because no major FA's have come since.  They went from pulling LeBron James and Chris Bosh with Wade in town to not pulling anyone."
Then you should know that the of offense doesn't lent to any one player having a lot of assists like LeBron James. 
"No, if you lose James, you rebuild from the ground up, and since there’s not a lot of draft picks available to you, you go ahead and make your safe picks to build a foundation.  Like, if LeBron leaves, the Cavs are literally a lottery team, you think they go in to the draft saying to themselves, “okay, which player is going to help us beat Golden State 5 years from now?”   You wrote that the LBJ-less Cavs win 45 games. That’s just dumb, dude.  "
So you are telling me that this whole Lebron James is good at basketball? Big if true
"In the finals he averaged 18 ppg, 6 rebounds, and 2 assists while shooting 61&amp;#37; from the field and 58&amp;#37; from the 3. On the other end, he was defending the unstoppable force that was Lebron James. "
"Yeah once again you're completely hopeless... You clearly don't understand how full team matchups work. Nothing about the Boston/Philly series was elite, and I hate to break it to you neither was the next round.  You're clearly delusional since you think Tatum 'dominated' Lebron James. Nobody who has watched the NBA for any amount of time would say 18/4/2 is a dominant performance. For a rookie? Damned impressive and his upside is HUGE, be he is far from dominating.   You're just another angry insecure person who comes up with these 'absolutes' with no actual basis in the real world just to make yourself feel more in control. You're whole point in every comment you've made was based on 1 series. Such a stupid, short-sighted, and small-minded view. "
"Hahahaha hilarious, a team of Dejounte Murray, Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, Lamarcus Aldridge, and Dwight Howard.  hahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahaha we should totally try that line up for a year for pure hilarity and not any other reason!!!!!!"
Yeah that team dosen't sound good at all. I think they will be in the lottery    And the max guy they add will probably be the Harrison Barnes/Hassan Whiteside type of max player and not the LeBron James/Chris Bosh type unless you guys draft the next Dwade

What if my favorite celebrity is Lebron James?
Who is utilized for clicks more often?  Donald Trump or Lebron James?  Serious question.  
"ESPN’s massive, throbbing hardon for LeBron James could be seen from the ISS. Seriously, they try to shoehorn that dude into every conversation.  &gt;Collin, welcome to Cleveland what about LeBron?  &gt;Greg Popovich, your wife just died can you comment on what impact this will have on landing LeBron in free agency?  &gt;Phil Mickelson, you just had a massive collapse at the US Open. How would LeBron James have handled that situation?  &gt;Kyle Busch, you just broke Richard Petty’s all time wins record, will anyone ever beat LBJ’s 8 straight Finals record?  &gt;Mo Salah, Sergio Ramos tried to rip your arm out of its socket. Do you think LeBron James is going to LA or Houston?  &gt;AJ Styles, you just went through a hellacious slobberknocker at Money in the Bank, how would LeBron James have handled Shinsuke Nakamura?  ESPN is total shit. "
Certainly LeBron James. Just can't hang with the likes of all these new cats.
"It was super forced how she said ""Now say something to make Lebron stay"". And then when he did she looked at the camera and went ""And Colin Sexton calling out Lebron James"""
"So you don't think that the game is evolving to a point where every position on the floor needs to be able to shoot? You don't think its an issue that his defenders can sag off him and clog the lane for someone like, LeBron James? Obviously he can score by driving. But his inability to make free throws, when he drives and gets fouls, and his complete lack of a jump shot or 3 point shot, will cause major issues going forward. "
I think espn has a quota on how many times they have to mention lebron James 
"Quicken Loans arena will be named ""The throne of God Emperor LeBron James"" arena. It'll be a bit of a mouthful "
"The more reports I see coming out about players not named LeBron, I'm beginning to feel like James just might opt-in, and they're going to try the whole L.A. thing next off-season.   ....or it's all a smokescreen."
"[Lebron was the pivotal part that caused KLove to go to Cleveland](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/cavaliers/2014/08/26/kevin-love-cavliers-news-conference-lebron-james/14626643/)  [Kevin Love had indicated to Minnesota that he was planning on leaving and was asking to be moved](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11397368/kevin-love-traded-minnesota-timberwolves-cleveland-cavaliers)  So yes, he was going to be a FA, and yes he told the front office that he wanted to go somewhere else. The trade was due to KLove wanting out and the trade going to Cleveland was because of Lebron."
Or if Lebron James is as good as Lebron and James Harden combined!?
EHAT IF KEVIN JAMES THE MALL COP WAS AS GOOD AS KEVIN DURANT AND LEBRON JAMES COMBINED!?!?
Lebron James  /thread
"LeBron James and Giannis are wings. Bigs are players who only play the Center or PF spot. You're stretching the definition for the sole purpose of saving face.  AD. has length, height, and hops. He isn't that explosive. He is a lot better than Randle overall. Just not in explosiveness.  Blake Griffin was more explosive than Randle. The level of explosiveness Randle is operating at, Blake was last at in 2015. He isn't as explosive as he used to be and not as explosive as Randle.  Bagley is what we were debating so... Honestly you brought up AD. Which is a giveaway for just throwing out names as he isn't even in the conversation. AD is athletically elite in other ways. But not explosiveness. There are quite a few people who are more explosive than him. "
 LeBron James
Raptors faired pretty well. Chris Pratt = LeBron James.
"I’m have been a fan for the past 4-5 years but I was also a fully devouted football/ soccer fan. The open mindedness you show to watch American sports is sooo beneficial. For me, I started watching MMA around 6 years ago and then once I got addicted to MMA I just decided to watch basketball and American football and they’re also both so entertaining! Anyway, I’m a warriors fan and have been for the last 5 years just because they were the first team I watched and I liked Curry’s range. But easily the most influential, mind blowing player I have ever read up on, heard of or studied is LeBron James. So coming into the NBA he was a star. I think he was on the cover of sports Illustrated at aged 12. He then comes in 6’8 250lbs 44 inch vert and could run over 20mph! So that athleticism is unparalleled but the craziest part was that you have someone who was built like Karl Malone, could jump like Vince Carter and could run like Chris Paul but it was his skill which was the cherry on top. His playmaking was incredible from the very first game. He then worked on his jumper, even shooting over 40% from 3 in Miami. Now it seems like the guy never misses. You see him taking fadeaways, tough contested mid ranges one footed floaters and he still shoots over 50% from the field every season. But most impressive of all, he’s in his 15th season, 33 years old and he still consistently dunks on people, puts up MVP numbers and leads the league in minutes. I love MJ and everything he brought to basketball but LeBron James is the greatest of all time."
"Also, you gotta stop calling harden James when discussing him with LeBron..."
"Which is fair, considering the Warriors might start falling apart around that time and LeBron James should realistically be on the decline. There's no reason to even try to compete *(with the state we're in)* until then. Just sucks to know I'll have to watch two more tank-seasons..."
"I don’t think many would choose college over instant payday. Especially if your family doesn’t have a lot of money. If you’re good enough it’s certainly worth it.   I imagine teams will have different needs in a draft - a guy who can compete right away vs a project who’ll take more time to develop. Depending on how many teams are looking to rebuild those younger players with more “potential” will get drafted each year.  And there were quite a few drafted in the years leading up to the rule change (2006 season)  1995: 1 - KG 1996: 2 - Kobe &amp; JONeal 1997: TMac 98: 3 Al Harrington, Rashard Lewis, Korleone Young 99: 2 Jonathan Bender, Leon Smith 2000: 2 - Darius Miles &amp; DeShawn Stevenson 01: 5 Kwame Brown, Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry, Desagana Diop, Ousmane Cisse 02: 1 Amar’e Stoudemire 03: 6 Lebron, Travis Outlaw, Ndubi Ebi, Kendrick Perkins!, James Lang 04: 8 Dwight Howard, Shaun Livingston, Robert swift, Sebastian Telfair, al Jefferson, josh Smith, JR Smith, Dorell Wright  05: 9 Martell Webster, Andrew Bynum, Gerald Green,  CJ Miles, Rickey Sanchez, Monta Ellis, Louis Williams, Andray Blatch, Amir Johnson  "

"This has blown out of proportions! Let me try to explain it further since the title is like something that you'll read through a tabloid or what. Quite long and all but I'm not defending Pacquaio, I'm just giving the logic behind it and some proofs on why it should be implemented.     **Philippines League**    First of, let me say that this league was created by Pacquaio for the street ballers who were not given a chance to play in big name leagues. Currently, in the Philippines, there's 2 major professional leagues for basketball, that's the Philippines Basketball Association (PBA) and their ""D-League""  or mostly known as Philippines Basketball League (PBL). Now, in order for you to qualify playing for those teams takes extra effort since both leagues has only around 12 teams and  12 roster (only 144 players per league), players retire till they're 40 and Philippines basketball has a tendency to only play 7-8 players per game and they have imports too 2/3 of the playing year (they have 3 conference per year, 1 all-Filipino and 2 others with imports). In short, what I mean is that, good luck if you ever see a chance to play on this league! Meanwhile, our college basketball has 2 major leagues, the UAAP and NCAA, consists of 12 teams too per league. This creates a surplus of talents since every year, out of all those hopefulls, only a handfull is given a chance to play in these big leagues. Those other talents are either playing street ball or they got hired by some small inter-city or inter-county leagues here. The pay is not much, pays a minimum wage here (roughly $200 per month here) but what can they do if basketball is their passion, right?   Then, here comes Pacquaio. He created the MPBL  5 years ago (I was able to play 1 conference, the 2nd year of the league I believe). Its a small league that time and we don't really have formalities on the structure of the game, it was Manny Pacquaio Basketball League for all I know and I played there because Pacquiao was there! 8 time world champ different division. You'll only have one chance to meet that guy, right? During the league, we were just roughly 6 or 8 teams, and played probably 4 games only before we got eliminated. It was a fun game, first time I played against teams from outside our region (State). By that time, I believe he already had a vision to bring back a Defunct Pro-League MBA (Metropolitan Basketball League) that was runned by one of the top TV network in the country. It was a inter-city league throughout the country. It was a great league as at one point, 20% of PBA players after it ended came from that league. It was a fun league way back as finally, a certain province or city can finally root for a team where they come from, just like the NBA. Unfortunately, due to high operation cost probably, the network decided to stop it. This is what's wrong, they created a league to make money out of it while Pacquiao created the league for players who are dreaming to join the PBA, but was unsuccessful. He gives hopes to those individuals. Now, from 8 teams, its now 28 teams if I'm not mistaken and every major city now wants to join, even Seattle lined up for it! (I love you Supersonic guys!). The league is fun and all as it brings even retired PBA players (oldest to play was probably 45 years old!) and some guys that were unsuccessful joining the PBA.      **Racism?**     Most Asian basketball leagues implements the no-foreigh player, but with mix (Mostly Filipino mom met Caucasian Dad and resulted to baby Mix) they have stricter implementations on it, since the genes of a caucasian and asian mostly combined results to Avengers like power in the Asian league. Actually, the reason that Philippines is kinda strong in the Asian Basketball League is because probably half of those players are mix (Thanks you America for having a US Military based here in the Philippines!). Mix mostly dominate games in these part of the world and it sucks if your team can't afford those type of guys coz of imbalances. They are mostly gifted physically, with the height and mass advantage. If a guy is from a mix decent, they certainly would be playing for either PBA or PBL here, if not, its most likely they are waiting to be called into the NBA D-League, I haven't seen a mix joining some minor league because that's how damn good they are here. Actually, if you put Jordan Clarkson on the PH national team, he will be like Lebron James most likely for Team Philippines (Yeah, imagine that!). Just to give you a sample, a College team in Philippines NCAA was able to dominate the basketball league for the past decade almost, they won 7 out of the 8 past championships because of foreigh and mix players. They have the budget to pay those guys under the table, and unfortunately, other teams can't. They're actually implementing a new CBA about it by 2020, which most likely will reduce the participation of mix nationals. See what happens when this is allowed? My point is, mix nationals dominates basketball in this part of the world, its not because its racist, its because its unfair and creates a big mismatch. Its not about them not being Filipino, its about balances. The league was created for the pure locals of the city they are playing (I believe one of the requirements for a city to qualify is it needs to have like 4 or 6 players from there city to be part of the roster).     Look, if those fools calling out Pacquaio wants a league with a lot of mix players on it, they are free to watch the PBA (Where out of 12 teams, its like 2 teams only won the championship for the past 12 conferences, talk about parity right?). Nobody is forcing them to watch or support Pacquaio's league, Its his own league in the first place, he can do what ever freaking thing he can on it.      By the way, I believe what MPBL is referring to mix here is guys who have dual citizenship, which is the case for most of our national players. Not those who players like Chris Tiu, Jeff Chan, etc... which are pure Filipinos but with just a touch of Chinese on them. "

"What's their hope? That Simmons and company win them a title? Lebron gives them that now. It's never stupid to take the ball out of someone else's hands and gibe it to Lebron when you're trying to win a title .   I I think we're too focused on development. You can live with Simmons losing some time as the main guy. Their only concern should be whether Simmons can fit with James, not whether it slows his development.  "

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

Cleveland Cavaliers: Collin Sexton, PG, Alabama &gt;The Cavs seems to have accepted the inevitable with this pick by drafting a ball-dominant point guard who would not fit well next to LeBron James. Cleveland is the perfect situation for Sexton, who should be able to thrive in pick-and-rolls with Kevin Love. He’s going to have a huge role in the offense right away, which should put him right at the front of the Rookie of the Year race. The key for Cleveland is to not let him develop too many bad habits on a team without many other ball handlers."

"For me, I feel like Kawhi and James is enough. The rest you should need a good supporting cast that can make threes and play defense. If you look at the rocket warriors series, the reason Rockets was so close was how good CP3 was at controlling the pace of the game and everything else came together.  I feel like with the Lakers; Lebron needs to play the CP3 role, which he already does, then having Kawhi be his second offensive option and main defensive wing is enough to match warriors or give a run for their money. Of course the Lakers bench and other starters will have to play great defense and shoot decent but I feel like having those two really sets the tone for them."

Kevin is frantic in finding out why Lebron James is so harsh to the curly haired boy. Will they keep fighting or end up falling in love?"""
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with LeBron James. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body.  I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to LeBron. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry.  Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.  One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin.  Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."

"Why does everyone assume Philly isn't an option at this point? We have a better core, better assets, easier path to finals, and nearly as much cap space. If it's about basketball LA is not the best option under any circumstance. If it's about wanting to be in LA as a city...well fuck we don't want him anyway then.  Dark horse Sixers slight overpay to trade for Kawhi without guarantee of extension, lures LeBron along with him, PG stays in OKC. Sixers play well under that scenario then Kawhi likely will stay.  Edit: Also market isn't much smaller (#4 vs. LA @ #2).

"""I'm LeBron James,"" says LeBron James, who says there is ""no pressure"" on him to deliver Summer League tickets. ""You know how many Summer League games I’ve been in? So you think I'm worried about this? I watched Markelle Fultz in Summer League games. I watched nine Summer League games."""
LeBron James was at 82 Cavaliers games this season. Were the signs here the entire time?
Lebron James was at a Philly summer league game last offseason*
How dare NBA players take the summer off to relax and not revolve their entire lives around LeBron James.
"You had me at ""this was the first time that LeBron James followed in Windhorst's footsteps."""
"I clearly illustrated that Lebron James followed Brian Windhorst to SVSM and to the Heat and the Cavs, playing his first games there shortly after Windhorst started covering the teams. "
"Those are averages over a 15 year career. Also KD is considered on of the top 2 offensive players today (Curry is the other one lol) and LeBron can put up points just as much as him while his best skill isn’t even scoring; putting pressure on defense and getting his guys open / and also being a great offensive threat off ball as well. He has no weakness offensively, defensively over the course of the game you would like to see more but part of it also because the opposing team rarely attacks James on offense. "
"I'd say the big difference is how much LeBron James brings out the best in his teammates. KD obviously gets the assists, but LeBron just knows how to work his team in the right way to get the job done. "
"I just mean Lebron has been a headline in a lot of stories Isaiah has been in last couple seasons. From beating him in playoffs, to getting traded for Kyrie and being the replacement #2 for Bron, stirring shit up on the team and getting traded by LeGm, and now is an afterthought in a franchise ultimately trying to sign, Lebron James. "
"So Ingram, Kuz and two late first rounders for Kawhi, Lebron James and Paul George?, sounds good to me "
"I mean honestly, in the position the Lakers are in, if they can get the Spurs to swallow the Deng contract they might as well just include ALL of their young assets. Ball, Ingram, Kuzma, Hart, etc. Just clear the books entirely. Because once you have Kawhi on board, you might be able to convince Bron and company to take Durant-esque paycuts (25 mil each) and it's not all that far-fetched they'd have Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and LeBron James all locked up this Summer. Then they throw a couple bucks at Nerlens Noel to round out the roster.  Big picture, you just give up everything."

The 3rd is Lebron James. He told me he is coming to Philly when free agency starts. 
"Of all the super teams the lakers have had, only 2 of them didn't work. Also lebron James and Leonard are much better than injured Nash and Howard. Let me offer you a super team featuring lebron James and you tell me if you turn it down."

Never thought I'd say this but thank fuck for LeBron James
"TL;DR of the War of the Sources, 2018 edition:  Spurs (Woj): Gee the Lakers only want to give us BI and a pick. We want more. The Celtics will give us Kyrie, and the Lakers need to do something before they lose everyone when LBJ opts in tonight.  Celtics (Woj): FOH with that Kyrie noise, can your dude even walk?  Lakers (Momo): I’m Magic Johnson. I have played in the NBA Finals many times, even against Larry Bird. We may engage in trades of our basketball players for basketball players on other teams.  Paul George (ESPN): Hey! I have this TV show about this big thing in my life! Please watch — anything could happen. Really!  LeBron James (???): This is my universe. While the day-to-day activities of you mortals are amusing to me, I honestly DGAF. Sometimes I just fuck with you because I can. "
"&gt;Yesterday, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said that it was ""almost embarrassing"" that LeBron James had complained about a few hard fouls he received during Wednesday's Heat-Bulls game. Heat president Pat Riley did not take kindly to Ainge expressing his opinion, and he just issued the following statement through a Heat official:  &gt;""Danny Ainge needs to shut the fuck up and manage his own team. He was the biggest whiner when he was playing, and I know that because I coached against him.""  I don't think Ainge or Riley or Magic would let it affect their decisions (except perhaps at the margins) but the animosity is real."
"""I was also told that LeBron James had to let some of his sponsors know where he would be going,"" he wrote. ""The reasoning behind it is that the contents of this said trailer will state where the King is actually going.""  http://www.ibtimes.com/lebron-james-rumors-cavaliers-star-already-knows-where-hes-going-2695087"
Lol you’re obviously trying to downplay how big of a choker your “MVP” is. James “0-23 from 3” Harden can’t hold a candle to LeBron and will never be considered an all-time great let alone compared to Michael Jordan. If they switched places LeBron wins another championship this year while Harden goes out in the 1st round against the Pacers. 
"From what my sources told me, LeBron James met with J.R. Smith face-to-face, looked him dead in the face and told him “He got me. That f***ing Tatum boomed me. He's so good. He's so good. He's so good. He's so good."""
&gt; If we get LeBron James I'm happy to ship Al Horford away with his max contract  Lol you don’t say?
"I respect him, but there is no one I want to see fail more than LeBron james"
"Embarassed forward Lebron James yelled out, “He got me!” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Forward Jayson Tatum yelled out, “We got an [expletive] dunk now.” And before Tatum hit the locker room door, NBA great Lebron James hugged him and said, “Let's work out this summer.”"
"Wonder what affect Leonard to Boston has on James, Paul, George?  Does that point Lebron to Houston to team up with Harden and Paul? Will that team have legit chances to take down GSW and Boston? Yes. Philly the same.  To me Leonard to Boston may put one of those two options to the top.  The Lakers option is the one that seems the craziest, needing 3 players to move and can they afford paying them all with the cap rules?"
That was against Lebron James and 4 potatoes.

And I would even bet that a couple of the incoming rookies will be better than jayson tatum by 2019-2020  Sorry 
Its about what you stand to gain vs what the Spurs stand to gain.  You stand to gain Lebron James and Kawhi Leanord.  Thats another dynasty.  The Spurs will get some young players who may one day be almost as good as Lebron James and Kawhi Leanord.
"When you are LeBron James, and you are his age especially, you don't just sign and wait. Every year matters. "
LeBron going back with James Jones
Gloria James is a notorious cougar. She was dating some local rapper when Lebron was in Miami. I wouldnt be shocked if she banged a few of his teammates.
"Thank god the shit I'm seeing in here are from reddit posters and not actual GMs.  You give up BI, the first, and more for Leonard without a second damn thought. Why? Because you aren't trading for only him. You get him, you get James, if you get James, you land PG.  ""That's too much!""  L-M-F-A-O. Giving up brandon damn ingram, Kuz, a couple of firsts, for Lebron damn James, Kawhi damn Leonard, and Paul damn George is too much? TOO MUCH?! You gotta understand that they. ARE. A. PACKAGE. DEAL. We're reddit posters and don't get paid to make these decisions for a reason.  You're taking the damn trade Laker fans. Just enjoy the free rings and shut up smh."
Dude one of the posts he liked is from a game against us. That pretty much confirms it imo. I'm ordering a Lebron James Pacers jersey as we speak.
"LeBron opts out of Cleveland and Spurs hold onto Kawhi. Without Kawhi going to Lakers, LeBron heads East to Philadelphia because a Lakers team with just himself and Paul George would not be enough to top the Warriors. PG decides if LeBron isn't going to the Lakers then neither is he and re-signs with the Thunder. Not sure what happens with Kawhi after that (probably still traded), but I think the main reason he wants to go to the Lakers right now is because he's expecting LeBron to be there so without LeBron he no longer looks at LA as his #1 destination. I really think all of this is going to blow up in the Lakers face. I recall seeing quite a few Lakers fans here on Reddit getting quite cocky a week ago and counting the championships they would win since James, George, and Leonard were already Lakers."
"It’s impossible to describe a team that has LeBron James, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard as “gutted” "
"C'mon this is LeBron fucking James, not CP3 at 32. The drama (or lack there of in CP3's case) is 80&amp;#37; the media anyway...ESPN is trying to hype up another ""Decision"" so they can cash in. And let's be real, the Kawhi piece would not have the same hype if it didn't have such an impact on LeBron's inevitable destination. FOH with crediting the drama to any of these shady ass organizations."
"&gt;[Woj] The Kings have signed LeBron James to a 4 year, max-level deal  r/NBA:  lol Vlade what are you doing?  He doesn't fit their timeline at all!"
Toronto Raptors would have Lebron James sitting in a huge chair Abe Lincoln style. 
"If we get LeBron James I'm happy to ship Al Horford away with his max contract, I'm sure we'd need to clear more space but that's a start"
"Are you suggesting that Lonzo Ball is similar in potential to LeBron James. Bro do you also believe the Lakers core is better than Philly's core? Damn, life must be tough as a Laker fan. "
Waiting for LeBron James   Instead hear about Justin Harper 
LeBron James Jr. will be
"Dell Curry, Steph Curry, LeBron James"
No point in executing a trade for Kawhi where the Lakers don’t also have room for LeBron and Paul George.    Even if you fill the rest of the teams with scubs that’s enough to beat the Warriors. That’s 3 superstars. Kawhi was beating the Warriors by himself before he got injured in their last playoff series.  LeBron James carried a special olympics squad by himself to the finals. Just imagine having TWO superstars as well. 
Have you tried.  LeBron Raymone James? Paul Clifton Anthony George Kawhi Anthony Leonard  Before DeMarcus Amir Cousins?
"That water was blue, and blue is pretty close to purple. He calls himself King James. LeBron to Sacramento confirmed"
"Yes it's true, and your peak level is way off. There's been studies on this. 26-29 is there peak years. Once they hit 30 it's all down hill  [The age that this happens for players is variable, and it has gotten slightly younger over time; more and more top prospects are spending one year in college and then calling it quits to make way for the draft. But generally, it takes a few years in the system(s) for players to gain the necessary experience to succeed, and not have their bodies begin to fail them. So this typically happens anywhere from 26–29. Generally, once a player enters their thirties, they begin to decline in skill. The most notable exception is LeBron James](https://www.quora.com/What-age-do-NBA-players-hit-their-peak) "
"Good thing NBA GM's don't think like fans.   You take the closest thing to a guarantee every damn time. Sure Tatum and Brown can develop into all starts maybe even superstars. Doesn't mean much though. If we're talking winning championships. Should I list you all the MVPs who never won a ring? James harden is the latest, he may never win one. My point being this; just because a player has a high ceiling/is very good doesn't mean they'll ever win.   If Boston dumps most of their young guys and their assets to bring Kawhi and LeBron is they're guaranteed a ring. That's the greatest superteam in history.  Ps. I know the cap situation. Hayward and Horford would have to be gone."
"Okay, but not everyone has a team which will grow into the Warriors. Should the Magic believe in their young guys for the next three years, too?   Besides, the Warriors weren't choosing between some of their young guys and Lebron James or Kawhi. Kevin Love was really good, but not on that level. "
didnt have to watch it. I just waited till I googled lebron james
"Not over Hakeem.  Harden would have to surpass what Hakeem did and gain favor in the court of public opinion, and right now there's still a significant chunk of town that hates James Harden and thinks he is a bum that exploits the rules and doesn't always ball out while spending time at the club instead of working out.  If Lebron comes here and wins a title, it definitely wont be to Harden's benefit as a local hero."
Warriors All-time Super Team?  Nah fam how about the top 3 players in the NBA all on the same team.   LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers)  Kevin Durant (Golden State Warriors)  Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs)   
"I would not hesitate to call present day LeBron James the most athletic basketball specimen on Earth right now. He’s got a bit of time, dude."
It's a public foundation named after him. We have no idea how much money the foundation donated was actually from Lebron James.

Posting up might not have been the best term to use. I mostly meant that he did a ton of work down low and inside in Toronto and expanded his range a bunch when he came to the Heat to help accommodate their spacing.  https://allucanheat.com/2015/08/05/chris-bosh-evolution-miami-heat-stars-3-pointer/  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/3/20/5527848/chris-bosh-miami-heat-three-point-shooting  https://imgur.com/gallery/A04sRWO  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1545965-lebron-james-dominance-is-masking-chris-boshs-evolution  My point was that Bosh had to change his game to fit around Lebron (as everyone not named Dwade or Kyrie have had to do) and he did it extremely well.

I pretty much hate the Lakers organization, 75% of its often obnoxious fan base, the LeBron James GOAT cult, and large swaths of the city of Los Angeles itself.....   but I really, really liked their young talent. I liked their team at the start of last year. Those dudes could ball.   It’s kind of sad that so much of it was spent on giving Cleveland a shot in the arm last season, and so much more is going to be spent on acquiring Kawhi. It would have been interesting to see that group develop organically. They had chemistry, but they just needed to learn the details of winning.   Oh well, guess sympathetic Lakers are now in the past. Go Bron cult and the sad reality of Kawhi being reduced to a high priced 3&amp;D lackey. "
"**NARRATIVES**  2007 - LeBron cements himself as one of the greatest, being the best player in that Finals at age 22. Tim Duncan losing hurts his greatest PF of all time status.  2011 - LeBron winning a ring was expected, but removes the narrative that LeBron is a choker. Dirk again loses in the Finals, probably finishing his career without a championship. As LeBron played worse than D-Wade, D-Wade would probably end up winning Finals MVP which would hurt LeBron's GOAT status.  2012 - Kevin Durant is now discussed as the best player in the league? LeBron, D-Wade, and Bosh are still healthy and in their prime at this time. In real life 2012 Kevin Durant played amazing, it was James Harden who played horrible in the Finals. Narrative of Kevin Durant and Westbrook ""carrying"" their squad past the Heatles.  2013 - Tim Duncan gets his revenge with their revamped motion offense that won them the chip in 2014 in the real time line and almost 2013 as well. First back to back Finals losses for LeBron James. Hurts his legacy on GOAT status.  2014 - LeBron is now 2-1 vs Tim Duncan in the Finals. Don't think Duncan would be considered GOAT PF as he finishes his career with only 3 rings. LeBron in this alternate timeline ties the real LeBron with a total of 3 rings.  2015 - First back to back championships for LeBron as he leads his team without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love vs the upcoming Warriors. LeBron nearly approaches GOAT status at this point, winning a chip without his two best players, something Michael Jordan hasn't done.  2016 - Actually expected as they faced a 73 win Warriors team. Doesn't hurt LeBron's legacy and can arguably help his case for GOAT, as he took the ""greatest team of all time"" to a seven game series.  2017 - ""The greatest team of all time"" upgraded themselves with Kevin Durant -\_- But LeBron at this point earns himself the title of GOAT as he defeats the Warriors with Kevin Durant in 5 games. Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry have their legacies ruined.  2018 - LeBron thought 5 games was too merciful and to crush all the doubters (Skip Bayless), LeBron sweeps the Warriors this time around in 4 games. LeBron even handicapped himself by sending Kyrie Irving to Boston. The Warriors roster will definitely be gutted, with the core of Draymond, Klay, Curry, and Durant all having their legacies permanently stained and going their separate ways.  At this point in time LeBron is 6-3 in the Finals with 5(6) Finals MVP's. D-Wade wins it in 2011.  **FOR G.O.A.T**  6 Championships  5 Finals MVPs  9 Finals Appearaces  Sweeping Spurs Big 3 at age 22  Beats 2015 Warriors without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love  Beats upgraded Warriors with Kevin Durant in 5 games  Sweeps 2018 Warriors without Kyrie Irving  **AGAINST G.O.A.T**  D-Wade ""carried LeBron in 2011"", as D-Wade won Finals MVP  LeBron lost in 2012 to a young Thunder team while LeBron, Wade, and Bosh were healthy and in their prime  Lost again in 2013 to the Spurs, as LeBron lost back to back Finals which never happened to Michael Jeffery Jordan.  Losing in 2016 puts LeBron at a total of 3 Finals losses, where Michael Jordan is 6-0.  **CONCLUSION**  LeBron would definitely be the GOAT in this alternate timeline."
Did you just mention defence To prove a point for James harden lmfao he’s like the only guy in the nba that plays LESS defence than Lebron except he has NO excuse. 
"Couldn't be bothered to finish this one...   Can't believe this is actual ESPN content...  Wasuuuup! Hahahahhaaa… Woooo! Let me tell yall something alright? Look y’all We all know, I’m a fair minded brotha imam call it like I see it. And, I know yall wondering you sit up here and you see me calling it like I see it and sometimes I sound a little critical of the King, whateva. Yrmsayin? Omoye my man shiggy on Instagram say YO KING! NENENENNWEW-Wait a MINUTE weant talking BOUT A GAME TALKIN BOUTTA SERIES HERE ONE GAME! DAT KING. Let me be very, very clear. I wanna make sure errybody understand where I’m coming from. This is about LA \[cut\] -..AT! This AINT ABOUT THAT! Make no mistake about this aint about that yall. Make no mistake about it. LeBron in LA… it makes LA relevant again. And anytime a big market like LA is relevant that is a beautiful tHIIING! THAT’S What this is about THAT’S What this needed, THAT’S what was need so desparately! Now for those of you who don’t know, Magic Johnson was at LeBon James house face to face NINE OH ONE pacific standard time. 1 minute after the NBA free agency period opened they talked for 3 hours it was the FIRST TIME Magic Johnson and LeBron James ever sat down face to face one on onein the 16 YEARS that LeBron James. Has been in the NBA. This was SPECIAL yo! And LeBron- And Magic sold him and LeBron was done he came off vacation with Ma- with LeBron he flew in from his vacation rather to come home so MAGIC JOHNSON could meet him at da CRIB! THAT’S WHAT THIS IS! So we understand whats going on here. Philly didn’t have chance they gave they ga-they interviewed the night but they didn’t really have a chance. It was ALL ABOUT LA he DID what he did FOR CLEVELAND its time to move on. Got two 20 million dollar homes total of 44 million dollars. THIS is where he wanted to be."
Because KD scored on him so easily that he didn't realize Lebron was there? Is that the bit? He was put on KD at least. I agree with you in that I don't think KD has any fear when Lebron James guards him. 
This ain't gonna be the same LeBron James. Like stays. 
before lebron james is locked in? you goddam right.
Who cares it's LeBron fucking James
"Probably in his latest article for The Athletic.  https://theathletic.com/416800/2018/07/02/lloyd-lebron-james-restored-his-hometown-team-now-hes-off-to-do-it-again/   It's behind a paywall, so I can't confirm."
"So any team that losses in the 1st round in the bloodbath West should just give up? So Spurs should give up. Denver(din't make the playoffs) and Minnesota should give up. Portland should give up.   There are many ways the Thunder can improve:  1. Russ/George chemistry. They will be much better playing together. Russ was so timid at the beginning of the year. He didn't want to overshoot. Same with George. When they figure it out, watch out.  2. Adams. 24 years old and already a top10 Center. He will only get better. He has shown great flashes on offense. He is special because he has the potential to dominate the paint on offense and can still play great pick and roll defense.  3. Melo. They will find a better role for him this year. It might be addition by subtraction. He took way too many shots and held onto the ball way too much.  4. Abrines, Grant, Ferguson. All in their early/mid 20's. They can definitely improve massively to be solid role players.  5. Roberson at 25 is one of the best perimeter defenders in the league.   STOP TELLING LIES.  WESTBROOK DIDN'T GET HURT BECAUSE HE WAS WRECKLESS. HE GOT HURT BECAUSE BEVERLY TOOK OUT HIS KNEES WHEN RUSS WAS TRYING TO CALL A TIMEOUT.  Stop spewing total bullshit. Westbrook is not an injury prone player. He got injured ONCE. And got 3 surguries for that same injury.  And it was not because he was wreckless.  Over his 10 year career he is averaging 75 games per season.  Lebron James is averaging only 1 more game per year in the regular season then Russ.  Russ is literally one of the most durable players in the entire NBA. So STOP WITH YOUR BULLSHIT NARRATIVES.  So Westbrook has a low basketball IQ?  Funny his he averages more Assists per game then Lebron yet has the same Assist/Turnover ratio.    Just admit it. YOU FUCKING HATE WESTBROOK.  And you are bitter that Paul George rejected Lebron and choose to play with Westbrook instead. "
"The Warriors are the new Lebron James in the east, except they're not new because they went to back to back finals before adding the second best player in the NBA who keeps taking paycuts. There's no team in the NBA that can put a roster together on paper that is as good as the Warriors have now because of cap reasons."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"With Spoelstra people detracted from his championships because of the super teams, but I remember people at the time calling him a top 5 coach. Ty Lue has always been considered a bottom tier coach and now we get to see what he can do without LeBron James. I, like OP, am also excited to see Lue next season (but for different reasons). "
"How bout your favorite non Lebron James, currently in the league, player?"
"[GheeDota2] Lopez says Lowe says the Spurs lost a ""huge amount of leverage"" with LeBron James joining the Lakers.   Am I media now?"

It’s tough because Lebron James and Kobe are two of my favourite players of all time but I also like Stephen Curry 😬
"I have four favourite players of all time Shaquille O’Neal, Michael Jordan, Lebron James and Kobe Bryant "
Lebron James is now the best Lakers player ever
"&gt;So basically a team should not invest in an MVP level player who is almost 30 if they are not as good as Lebron James?    Didn't say that.   For the last time - OKC should be worried about their roster construction and path forward because they just lost a 1st round series with their squad and will likely bring the same team back while other teams in the West continue to improve. They are locked in with a 30 year old PG who can't shoot/relies on athleticism/doesn't have a great basketball IQ/plays recklessly with his body after already having 3 surgeries on his knee. This is not to say they shouldn't have extended him. But they SHOULD be worried about what their next step is, as they have little room to grow while Westbrook will be exiting his prime.   I'm done responding to you because it seems you have real issues with reading comprehension. "
"Well my favourite players of all time are Michael Jordan, Lebron James and Kobe Bryant. I’ve liked the Chicago Bulls for a while but I also like Cleveland Cavaliers because of Lebron "
LEBRON JAMES! Plus Kobe Bryant is my favourite basketball player right now so yeah that’s a shout 
"I don't have to dispute anything because 34 trumps 30 every single day of the week.  Russ had exactly 1 injury.  Beverly undercut his knee. He is not an injury prone player.  Before Beverly took out his knee he had never missed a single basketball game in middle school, high school, college, and the NBA.  So basically a team should not invest in an MVP level player who is almost 30 if they are not as good as Lebron James? LOL.  So you must think signing CP3 was a horrible move also?"
1. Lebron 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. James Harden 5. Steph Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. Russell Westbrook 8. Giannis  9. Chris Paul 10. Joel Embiid 11. Kyrie Irving 12. Damian Lillard 13. Paul George 14. Boogie Cousins 15. KAT 16. Klay Thompson 17. Demar Derozan 18. Jimmy Butler 19. LaMarcus Aldridge 20. John Wall  That's my list.
I mean a LeBron James lakers jersey would look nice tbh
" In baseball reference bold stats are league leading and italicized stats led the majors for that season. I don't think basketball reference uses italics and just goes with bold for NBA leading stats--this year LeBron James scored more total points than any other player, it's in bold on his page, Harden led the west and his total is normal font."
Cap space and a chance to play with LeBron James for multiple years should make it an easy decision for top free agents next year
lol because kobe's championships don't count. The exact idiot logic of someone who overrates lebron james' career because they know he's not better than a kobe or michael jordan.

"Lakers Legend, LeBron James.  Yep, that'll take some getting used to."
"Fellow Akron resident here, currently working on King James Way. Besides one of my friends from Cleveland whos panties are all in a bunch, I haven't talked to anyone who is upset. He brought us a championship. That's a lifetime pass in NE Ohio and LeBron knows that. "
"Charania] Sources: Lakers restricted free agent Julius Randle hasn’t yet received an offer from L.A., but has excitement for arrival of LeBron James. Randle’s representatives and the Lakers are expected to speak Monday, hopeful of potential offer to retain him."
Another shoe will drop for the Lakers. Lebron James doesn’t just sign with that team to play it out with the current roster.  
"Its probly because Spurs are asking for Ingram AND kuzma.  And honestly, Lakers can take their time with this team. Theyd just got Lebron james for 4 years and that means they have a lot of options as to how they wanna build their squad.  Dont need to go all-in within 3 days of free agency ya know?"
&gt;Every player in the league eventually hits a plateau.  They do but you don't know what that plateau is. Has Lebron James hit it for example?
"LEBRON JAMES AND HIS FUTURE HEAD COACH, LUKE WALTON, ARE FROM THE SAME DRAFT CLASS.LEBRON JAMES AND HIS FUTURE HEAD COACH, LUKE WALTON, ARE FROM THE SAME DRAFT CLASS.LEBRON JAMES AND HIS FUTURE HEAD COACH, LUKE WALTON, ARE FROM THE SAME DRAFT CLASS.LEBRON JAMES AND HIS FUTURE HEAD COACH, LUKE WALTON, ARE FROM THE SAME DRAFT CLASS.LEBRON JAMES AND HIS FUTURE HEAD COACH, LUKE WALTON, ARE FROM THE SAME DRAFT CLASS.LEBRON JAMES AND HIS FUTURE HEAD COACH, LUKE WALTON, ARE FROM THE SAME DRAFT CLASS."
"He's really good as a ball handler. He's not LeBron, but James himself wasn't as good as he is when he was 23. The fact that Giannis is considered a top 10 player and is STILL developing is scary."
"""[Wojnarowski] Philadelphia is meeting with LeBron James and his reps today in Los Angeles, league sources tell ESPN."" was the #1 post on /r/nba for like half of yesterday.   Despite being straight up FALSE. LeBron was not in the meeting, Woj clarified this in a later tweet.  Where the fuck are the mods? This sub is out of control. "
"This sub just legitimately didnt want to believe it. Hell, I didnt even know if I wanted to believe it. Los Angeles Laker LeBron James still sounds weird as fuck"

"You'll continue to dwell in the past that was LeBron James but he's gone, he's never coming back and you'll never get another player like him. The NBA is done with all Cleveland related narratives. Goodbye."
Lebron James has updated his privacy policy and terms of service.
"My Personal List, if everyone is healthy:  1) Lebron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Steph Curry  4) Kawhi Leonard  5) James Harden  6) Anthony Davis  7) Giannis  8) Russell Westbrook  9) Paul George  10) Chris Paul  11) Jimmy Butler  12) Damian Lilliard  13) Joel Embiid  14) Demarcus Cousins  15) Kyrie Irving  16) Kristaps Porzingis  17) John Wall  18) Demar Derozan  19) Victor Oladipo  20) Gordon Hayward  The Porzingis pick is going to be controversial but I've seen Gobert in some lists and Porzingis is statistically (i.e. BPG, BLK%, FG% allowed at rim) just as good as him as a rim protector. Add on 22 PPG scoring and I think, if we're talking fully healthy, he's top 20. I think by the time he comes back from his injury, he'll have worked on his conditioning and he'll cement his place on the list."
According to mvp voting James harden was more valuable to the Rockets than LeBron James was to the cavs.

Raps lost the last few seasons to Lebron James. Some of the teams you listed haven't even won a playoff series. That's disrespect. 
I was considering posting something about LeBron James jr 
"If we keep Randle absolutely lol. It's not overrating the Lakers core at all, I don't expect that much from Ingram and Lonzo next year although Lonzo complements Lebron's game beautifully. Most of the players you listed have great solid roles, but come on man it's Lebron James. In the regular season these teams talent wise may be fairly even, but in a playoff series Lebron could crush them. "
"yeah i put them behind Warriors, but give them a chance against Rockets, regular season is one thing, post season is another and its Lebron James. i think the Lakers talent as is can perform better around Lebron than last years Cavs, dunno guess we will have to see.  Kumza can definitely shoot it, but not sure about others though so right on that it seems.  things haven't settled so kinda pointless till we see where this Kawhi stuff ends up, and other stuff."
"its kinda not worth trying to figure out though at this point, dust hasn't settled as far as all the movements that may go on.   regardless, a lot is possible with Lebron James in the mix.  at least right now Lebron has some good talent around him as is. "
I think james wanted that. Usually a no trade clause is beneficial to the player because even if magic were to make a trade with lebron. Lebron can either accept or deny that trade. 
"This is what Kevin O'Connor said:   ""Ball is the ideal point guard for James, in my opinion. He’s a lightning-quick decision-maker who doesn’t need to dominate the rock, and when it *is* in his possession, the ball never sticks. Ball is a smart cutter off the ball, a lob threat, and someone who defends and rebounds at a high level for his age. Lonzo’s shot must improve drastically, but he shot 37.4 percent on catch-and-shoot 3s from December 7 on (and after his [dismal start to the season](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/7/16744356/lonzo-ball-los-angeles-laker-shot)). If he continues making progress, he’ll be a worthy floor spacer alongside James, and he very well may already be the best passer that James has ever shared the court with. In the presence of LeBron, Ingram will get the easiest shots he’s ever had. He’s 6-foot-9 with limbs like Gumby, and he has a versatile offensive skill set around the rim and on the perimeter. When Ball was sidelined last season, Ingram displayed the same pick-and-roll playmaking prowess that he did as a freshman at Duke. The Cavaliers sorely needed a secondary off-the-dribble creator in the playoffs to help LeBron. The Lakers have two of them developing in Ball and Ingram."""
What? NO and UTA don't have that deep of rosters either. And well it's Lebron James. 
"Also people dogging him for the kicks but it’s super easy to fuck your hand up punching anything (ask Marcus Smart, Lebron James, Hunter Strickland etc.).  Those hands are worth millions and a blow out in an international game is not the place to fuck them up.  "
LeBron gets kicked in the head  His vision is blurry  Ringing in his ears  He only sees JR Smith’s face  He sees Bloodsport throw a superman punch  BLOCKED BY JAMES.  Bloodsport can’t believe it.  James picks up Bloodsport and throws him on the ground.  He starts hammer fisting Bloodsport until Magic Johnson pulls him away.  
"I don't think you understand how different this is? Do you? Sure you can just say ""Oh another team in the east gets beat by the Dubs""  But in the last 8 years, One name has been there every year   LeBron Raymone James  Him moving out West is not only doing something that many said he would never do bc he wouldn't relinquish his stranglehold on the East, but also you have three teams out East that have young stars and superstars ready to fight and prove themselves along with the Raptors attempting to leave LeBron's shadow.  There is a power Vacuum and we all assume the Celtics will get to the finals, but relying on Kyrie's health isn't the best bet. 76ers are losing their shooters, Bucks may actually just be improving, Raptors are running it back with a different coach and now no LeBron....  It'll be interesting"
"Ok wtf, are you guys seriously getting into semantics. The bottom line, once Lebron's legs go...he does not have a great post game...he will not have a great perimeter game...he is not agile like Kobe/mj...watch kobes espn+ video...Lebron has a very stiff game...he dribbles with a high center of gravity...and is not necessarily shifty or free flowing like a Kobe or kyle anderson ....guys who can excel at a slow pace. I don't know how the eff I have to argue this, it is universal thought of that Lebron dominates on pure ath, power and speed at his size. You guys are now making him out to be James Harden or Kyrie Irving.   Again, when his legs go, he will have to rely on other skills I don't think he has. I guess, everyone thinks he shoots like Kobe and has the post game of duncan. "
nobody likes floppers unless your name is lebron james 
"I kinda wish the FA signings listed the new team first since the old team is largely irrelevant to that player now.   Not a huge deal, but I'd much rather see LAL, LeBron James, 4 rows, CLE instead of CLE being first."
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving is a good start and probably in some order the top 11.

"&gt; You can say “but fuck Dan Gilbert” all you want, fact of the matter is Dan paid out the ass for anything LeBron wanted.  He also acted like an immature asshole when LeBron left the first time (not that James covered himself in glory).  If you are James, why on Earth would you consider putting four years of your life in the hands of a guy who has shown himself willing to be an asshole at the expense of the team's potential future?

"Lol Kyrie is not better than Dame  Kyrie has always had Lebron fucking James to take the heat off him in the playoffs.

A team with Lebron James on it will always be a top team. Not facing adversity as a fan is a big part of bandwagoning.
"The NBA has and always will be a superstar league. You can definitely be a LeBron James fan.   Local lines for fandom are stupid, anyway. Root for whoever you want to root for. I’m from CT, I am a Knicks fan, but LeBron is my favorite athlete I ever watched. Do you. "
"And in other Laker related news, LeBron James only has one more championship ring than JaVale McGee."
Yeah but I don't believe Melo had or formed a relationship with either of them anywhere close to the Melo/James have.  If anyone could convince him would it be LeBron + playing in LA?  I don't think it would rejuvenate Melo but could make him not flaming garbage
"1. Maybe I should have explained better. All I'm saying is it does not have the same vibe as other huge signings where you know this guy is a Laker for life.Lebron will go into the HOF as Cav. In the 2000's the debate was whether Kobe, a laker, or Lebron, a Cav, was the best in the game. He does not have the vibe of a laker. Kareem, is not a buck. Wilt is not a 76er. Shaq is not a magic. They are thought of as Lakers. LeBron being on the lakers just has a strange vibe. For example; Shaq, Wilt, Kareem show up to Laker ceremony's. They give speeches ect. for HOF inductions, statues et. al. I don't think Lebron would go to one in 20 years or at the very least would find it odd.  2. We cannot afford, or have need for, veteran mid exception role players. That is exactly what we do not want. at. all. We already have a young nucleus who are vying for playing time, especially now that Lebron has taken a starting spot.  However, with LeBron that means we, I guess, are in win now mode. And I don't think, in years to come, having just Lebron is enticing for the younger stars coming up. Which is what we want. He had great pull with the banana boat boys but that time is over.   3. Lebron doesn't make that a possibility. Did you just see the finals??? He got swept by GSW. Regardless, of what was said during the entire playoffs, he actually had a pretty decent team. K love would easily be 20 10 guy and the star of our current Laker team. Hill and others would probably be starters, as well, if they were thrown on the lakers.  He's also now in the West, and doesn't have cake walk to the finals.  4. Manu missed those free throws and killed their spirit. They were amazing to watch and played team basketball but talent wise they weren't that great and had an aged Parker, Ginobli and Duncan. They would have not lasted in the top heavy league today.   OKC were very young. And were unusually young for a finals team. It's not like they spent year battling and losing in the Western Conf finals either. They had a promising season the year before and then full on broke out and made the finals the following year.   Yeah, look at what they had now. But at the time they were so young, that they let James Harden go in FA so they could sign Ibaka. That's how young they were.   5. Dude, you guys are rediculous, you take specific points to try and win you're arguments. Yes he is the best player in the league, though that was debated in the years prior with Curry and Durant, BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT he is 33 and signed a 4 year contract with no actual plans to sign anyone else. So yes, DON'T sign him, unless you can beat GSW or the Celtics.   You spent 5 years tanking to rebuild, then finally had a promising year with a young nucleus. There is no reason to sign Lebron unless their is a plan in place that will allow you to compete for a championship right away.   6. I don't agree, I guess we will just see. I don't think he has the game or agility to excel from the perimeter like MJ and Kobe did when they began to hit the wall. And he doesn't have the post game to excel from the inside. Plus that is no longer effective in todays NBA. All I'm saying he has always relied on his athleticism, power, speed, ect. He is an extremely unique player in that aspect and I don't think he has much to fall back on when those go. And if people think it goes slowly and that he's been fine so far. No, thats not the case. Every player, when they hit the wall they hit the wall. There body goes, a bad injury happens, can't hit the weight room as well, and within months they're not the same player.  7. Uh, that's exactly what every decent GM has been planning for. Lebron created the first superteam and dominated the league then GSW. It's been a top heavy league for a while. Now a lot of those teams who were tanking are seeing dividends. This is the absolute worst time to pay an aging superstar. The worst time. It's like buying a house in 2008.  8. Magic Johnson is known for delegating work. His strength, I think he even said, or at the very least has been said about him in his business ventures has been delegation. "
"- LeBron James, referring to Brandon Jennings, post-Bucks-in-6 comment"
"To also add some perspective, the KD was widely regarded as the second best player in the league (after lebron James). That year the Golden State Warriors went 73-9 in the season, which was the best record in NBA history. They had won the championship the year before and were 1 player suspension and some amazing heroics by the Caveliers from winning back to back championships. They were already a HISTORICALLY great team and then added the 2nd best player in the game. As a result the NBA for the last two years and likely the foreseeable future has been like watching a movie you already know the ending to. Sure there might be some drama, but you already know what's going to happen.  Basically LeBron couldn't do it with Cleveland anymore because not only were the other players on his team old and pretty bad, they were making a lot of money. This leaves the team with no room to sign better players, and no other teams want to trade for aging and overpaid players. The other good player that was on the team the year they won left because he wanted to be 'the man' on his own team. Basically opposite of what KD did. He also thinks the Earth is flat. "
"I don’t think lonzo is a clear cut better fit than lillard at all. Lebron loves to play with someone who can go get buckets when needed. Lakers don’t have that rn. Lillard would be like his Kyrie.   Lonzo over lillard doesn’t not give you a better chance at beating the warriors, at all. And why would the lakers care about giving up a future first? They have Lebron fucking James... go win a ring. It’s not like they need more young talent."
I know Kawhi ain’t coming this year for sure but you’re claiming LeBron James and Kawhi together is a perennial 5th seed? Cmon bruh. Let’s be real. You’re literally adding two top 5 players in the league to a 35 win team.  
LeBron James wants to know your location 
Championships are team accomplishments that are the end all indicator of whose the best ever or else we’d have some skewed ranks like draymond green being on par with Lebron James cuz he he has 3 or bill Russell being the best ever cuz he has like 11. Lebron by all means has solidified himself as better than Kobe. He’s chasing rings not because he wants Kobe but because he wants MJ who has comparable stats so championships is the only way to edge him out.
nobody in the west is going to play ball with the lakers. that's the price of business when you get lebron james. 
Kevin Love actually said he wants to continue playing with LeBron and finish his career with him.   [Source](https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-love-says-wants-play-lebron-james-rest-career-044130930.html?src=rss)
"That's incorrect they are not currently in the luxury tax. While the Cavs are over the salary cap by $8 million, they are actually under the luxury tax line by $13 million after the departure of Lebron James. [Source](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/cap/)"
"We drafted George Mikan, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Kobe Bryant (through Charlotte). We absolutely. Hold through draft, and supplement it with big trades (Kareem, Wilt, Gasol) and FA signings (Shaq, Lebron). "
"but then on the other hand - lebron james, top level nba player, top level memes "
Thats 33.5 year old LeBron James to you
And 34 year old Lebron James is still a tier above all of them. 
"Kawhi is a Steph, KD, AD tier player and you have 34 year old LeBron James. "
"Unique mindset is one way of putting it...honestly all this stuff plus other stuff we know about Kyrie makes him sound like a real tool. I don’t get why you would chafe at playing with a guy like LeBron. It just seems like such a clear example of caring more about satisfying your ego than being on a winning team. I guarantee you history views James Worthy or Kevin McHale or Scottie Pippen better as part of their dynasties than they would have if they were stars on their own. And there’s a big enough age difference that Kyrie could have taken over the team within a couple years. It seems pretty clear from all this that he was too jealous to wait that out.  Him getting upset about the flat earth controversy is annoying to me too. It shows how little he must think about stuff, number one to believe that shit anyway, and number two to get his feelings hurt when people say how dumb it is. If LeBron said he was into flat earth the entire world would mock him mercilessly. But instead he talks about social issues like an intelligent human being, without also letting us know that he believes in a ridiculous theory that only idiots subscribe to. That would seem to account for the difference in perception I think..."
"Damn he is good, I don’t know why people stillquestion me when I say he has the potential to be the next LeBron James   This kids IQ is off the roof, he understands that the only way to beat the warriors this year is for darkness, for Luka was born into the darkness and molded by it. "
&gt; he looks to be heading to his breakout year in 18-19 with him being the focal point of the Lakers offense  Ever heard of LeBron James?
"I had this dream a few months ago.  I’ve just come back from work. As I open the door, I notice that there are at least a dozen Nike basketball shoes in the hallway. I find this quite strange. Obviously I have guests over, but I  never expected them.  I go upstairs, and I see pretty much the entire Cleveland Cavaliers squad there and a few others. They all give me high fives, shake my hand, talk with me and make me feel quite special. Though when I try to get into my bedroom, Kyle Korver tells me that he doesn’t think it’s a good idea. I laugh it off and just go through anyway, as I would like to change from my work clothes.  I go into my bedroom and I see JR Smith in nothing but a towel with a video recorder in his hand. He’s recording Jose Calderon having sex with my girlfriend (missionary). Calderon is in nothing but a Toronto jersey ,which I found quite strange, and he’s thrusting in and out very quickly.  In my dream, I put my hand on Calderons shoulder from behind and tell him, “mate, I think that’s enough”.  He responds with “My friend, is ok, no?”  I tell him that it’s definitely not OK.  At this point my girlfriend Emily doesn’t even acknowledge my existence. Kevin Love comes in and gets me into a full nelson and drags me out of the room. I have been manhandled, ridiculed and disrespected in my own property, by people that I once looked up to. I’m sitting at the bottom of my stairs, quite bemused. The doorbell rings. I open the door, it’s Lebron James. Finally, a man of such respect, regard and authority would restore order in my own household. I approach him, congratulate him on the 2016 title and then go on to explain what has been happening upstairs. He has a trademark smirk on his face and tells me he will take care of it. He practically bypasses the orderly queue formed outside of my bedroom and enters as Jose and JR walk out.  Then the next 30 minutes are just followed by loud thumps and squeaking which clearly shows that he was just as bad of the rest of them.  At this point, I woke up because of my alarm. But as I was in the shower I was like what the fuck did I just dream about.  "
"It just goes to show you that being lebron’s teammate can be and is very hard. You’re automatically second fiddle to him despite being a huge talent like Kyrie. I can see why he wanted out of there and lebron was hurt by it. That’s why lebron had to work and ball as much as he did, Kyrie did a lot of thankless heavy lifting.  I’m not defending one and bashing the other, even though it may seem that way but I’m a basketball fan keeping it on the periphery. Regular season means nothing to me, I always pay attention when the playoffs come around and unabashed to admit it.  Living in Miami I heard, saw on tv and read about the lebron experience and it sounded terrible for everyone not named lebron james. You play great he gets the credit, play terrible he gets none of it. He’s a ball hog and no one bats an eye, deny him the ball and get ready for the media to descend upon that person. If he wants to handle the ball at all times why not just make him the point? It’s useless to have one and would be more useful to have a 3 out there doing what he does and having lebron just be the point. Having his cake and eating it too really hampers any roster construction. “I want the ball at all times but I’m not a point guard.” Really hustling backwards for a smart dude who at this point would benefit from making that shift. He’s tall enough to guard any point and possibly block their shot.  Anywell I digress to say that he shares and carries equal amount of blame for everything that happened in Cleveland. He shouldn’t skate one bit because Kyrie is a huge talent and he and everyone else realized it. If he had shot a genuine compliment or two or sent a few reporters his way Kyrie would still be there. He’s not free from blame or criticism regardless of what anyone says to me or downvote what I said.   He should be celebrated for his greatness but also be held accountable for any faults that come with it. He’s not blame free at all, but you also can’t say he isn’t one hell of a player."

Do you really not see the difference between sharing the spotlight with LeBron James and joining GSW after they bounce you?
Start him n have elgin coming off the bench. Prime lebron is better than him and James worthy 
"LeBron: *Keep doing what you doing, I may be back one day.*  Kyrie: *Huh?*  LeBron: *Like if you good enough and the Heat start to suck, Ima gonna bounce again to ring chase.*  Kyrie: *We don't need you.*  LeBron: *I'm LeBron James man.*  Kyrie: *Look, even if you did come back, I'd probably have to hit a huge 3 or something just to bring the Cavs it's only ring.*  LeBron: *I doubt that would ever happen.*  Kyrie: *Think again, bitch.*"
"http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9244504/lebron-james-miami-heat-1-vote-shy-unanimous-mvp-honor  That's a great article about LeBron's 2013 MVP that should have been unanimous but wasn't because of an idiot.   1 vote doesn't make that much of a difference to how good they are.  Your entire argument is wrong, I just wanted to point out how pointless your ""unanimous MVP"" spouting is.  LeBron's 2013 year and Curry's 2016 are pretty close but in terms of advanced stats LeBron has the slight edge too. LeBron was also second in DPoY voting that year so his impact on the game was definitely bigger."
TIL JJ Reddick is older than Lebron James 
"The Olympics have allowed only amateur athletes for most of its history, and it only started changing as recently as the 90s. In a lot of sports the Olympics is still not a big deal, and a lot of the top players opt to skip it.  Though honestly for most basketball players from small countries it would be a big deal even getting blocked or dunked on by someone like LeBron James."
Because it's LeBron fucking James.   If Kawhi Leonard wants to play for the Lakers then he's going to play for the fucking Lakers.   If the Lakers want to sign Kevin Durant to a Max then they're going to sign KD to a fucking Max.   SUPER TEAM
"James Johnson is Wal-Mart LeBron. He can do everything LeBron can, same size too."

Really it was all to set-up What if it was against **LeBroOoON JAMESSSS** that was **insane** officially^in^sane LeBron James ~~throwin the hamma down~~ *something something* **Deep in the Q!**.
"Lebron also wore the hooded sweatshirt to support that one teenager was shot after he assaulted a Hispanic man. Facts don’t seem to be important to him. Again, my original point of kyrie being upset how the media portrays James as some sort of political dynamo while making kyrie out to be a buffoon is likely why he was peeved. Lebron has said just as many, if not more, false things as kyrie but he’s protected and praised by the media. "
It’s LeBron fucking James he can do whatever he wants. Find a new slant. 
"Kyrie is a goddamn virtuoso with a basketball, but he's also a dumbass with an enormous ego problem.   He challenged Kobe to a one on one in his rookie year, I'm pretty sure. Can't handle being second fiddle to LeBron muhfuggin' James. Literally made Uncle Drew to make fun of the older guys.   I said this the other day, but it's straight up sad how much of his career he's going to leave on the table because he's too stubborn and selfish to be anyone but the star. "

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"If you're super high on Trae Young, you can see him turning into Kemba with a quicker trigger on 3s and unlimited range. Carry the offense type player.   Doncic looks like a really good prospect but people need to stop acting like he's LeBron James. He's still a prospect and he needs to prove himself before we start shitting on the Hawks. The guy has flaws too. "

"Replace James Harden and Chris Paul with LeBron and Kawhi Leonard, what do you think happens during the playoffs this year? That Rockets team is generally a bunch of dudes and look how far they got. LeBron and Kawhi and smart coaching with the right role players is enough to beat the Warriors."
"Bill, and his website The Ringer, were on this LeBron Manifest Destiny shit [a year ago](https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/8/16076966/2017-nba-finals-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-los-angeles-lakers-clippers-25e353094845)."
"But one reason why Lebron's teams are underdogs is because he gets stud PFs and takes 4 rebounds off the top of them and turns them into 3 point shooters even when that's not fully their game. Lebron dominates the ball. The Spurs weren't some dominate team in 14, the Mavs took them to 7 games but they smoked the Heat. Wade shot 50% from the field but didn't get enough shots. Lebron had career playoff lows in rebounds and block numbers like he was 21 again. Anyway the last 2 years with Lebron Wade ( 31 and 32 years old) played all the playoff games and had a 53 TS% but only averaged 16.8ppg but since then from ages 34 to 36 has averaged 18.9ppg without Lebron and even older including averaging 21.4 at 34 years old sharing the ball with Butler. Lebrons team are always the underdog because Lebron doesn't elevate his squad and in many cases takes away from his teammates for his own gain. BTW preseason the Heat were favored in 14 to win it all. Also the fact that James, Wade and Bosh were in their prime and had just went to the Finals and were a underdog to a team who never been there before and main 3 were all 23 or younger says alot for Lebron "
Geography’s a bitch. Plus I choose to root for a specific player more than an organization or billionaire owner especially when that player is LeBron James

Indeed, three old friends live with him. However, the league said nothing to the 76ers, not that it had to. Pat Croce, the 76ers' brash new owner, laid down the law to a couple of Iverson's friends.  iverson is one of the most racially-divisive players ever, and the league didn't really know how to deal with him.  he wore baggy pants instead of suits and was a big reason for the institution of the dress code, which a lot of people saw as being racially motivated (people posted phil's take on that elsewhere in this thread).  i think the term posse was used to tar iverson and his friends as being a gang, and it's not surprising to me that lebron would bristle at a similar comparison to his friends, who are all key parts of his business empire.    https://theundefeated.com/features/without-allen-iverson-there-would-be-no-lebron-james/"

"I don’t think you understand my objection. Your system has a major flaw. Points are awarded based on vote share which, while related to skill is highly dependent on other factors. Factors such as league skill parity.   Here is an example of the issue. If prime lebron James wins MVP but Westbrook eats 25% of the votes and KD takes 5% of the votes that would be weighted as lebron winning 70% of the share.   Does that mean he is worse then steph who was the unanimous mvp in 2016? The answer is obviously not. But our only variable in this case is vote share so the data would say yes.   The fact is the share of the vote is a meaningless measurement when comparing prime lebron to 2016 steph curry. Even if they were exactly the same skill level in every respect steph would be weighted higher under these standards based solely on the fact that he was unanimously chosen.  Worse yet, even if steph was obviously worse then prime lebron he would still be weighted higher based on your standards.    You are also not addressing the fact that mvp vote share is heavily impacted by things like team success, media market size, popular opinion etc.   Here is another example:   If lebron wins the MVP next season and steph and kd  get 0 votes based on the fact that they are on the same team that would increase lebron’s total proportion of the share. Now If all things are held constant but kd is on a different team and he and steph each get 1 vote that would suddenly make lebron get a lower share and thus appear weaker. The lower share in reality doesn’t mean lebron is objectively worse because it is based on facts completely unrelated to lebron BUT his share would still decrease.  This demonstrates how vote share is a messy variable to use. The data is messy and many other factors impact the outcome.    Kd and steph getting votes in this case has nothing to do with the skill level of lebron, it is entirely dependent on whether or not they play on the same team. There is no way to control for these types of factors using your system of measurement.    Edit: anyone down voting me care to discuss what you disagree with? I’m legitimately curious why this is being downvoted "

So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"

"Is it really though? Lebron James is known to be passive aggressive even to his teammates. He's not going to spell it out for them.  I don't think there was really any real heat (no pun intended) with spo and lebron, but I could definitely see that with blatt and lebron. Lebron never asked for him to be fired but we can clearly see there's no lost lost there."
Could LeBron James give birth if he had the same physical attributes as a female?
"This is well-made and all, but I kind of hate that basically every single NBA player's logo has their initials and/or number forced into it.  Paul George? Let's start with PG and go from there. LeBron James? L is basically backwards J, lets run with that. Steph Curry? Let's mash SC **and** 30 together and see what happens.  It's just stale to me. I get why it's done for branding but I never think it looks good."
"This is absolutely not true. Go back and look at LeBron's heat map with the Heat. It was dramatically different even from from 2011 to 2012. LeBron moved from the wing to the left block, after he worked with Hakeem. He became one of the best post players in the league by feasting on the left block.  Edit: [Here](http://grantland.com/features/how-lebron-james-transformed-game-become-highly-efficient-scoring-machine/) is the proof in an article from Grantland. Now excuse me while I cry my heart out about Grantland being gone..."
nah i'm good we got cap space next season and lebron james
Oh no... Ohhhh... Oh man here it comes again....  #LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
If you're just looking at the star players you mentioned then Dirk because he beat 3 all stars including Lebron James. If we're just looking at difficulty from a team perspective I dont think anything beats coming back 3-1 in the finals against a 73-9 team. And I give a lot of that credit to Kyrie Irving. 
Did LeBron James die in this hypothetical?
i refuse to believe LeBron's never smashed biddies on the side like come on ur LeBron James
"I don't think he was really a shadow of himself. I just don't think LeBron gave him a chance.  He came back from hip surgery so he wasn't cutting as quickly off the P&amp;Rs like before. His shot being off was due to sitting out so long due to injury. And when he did get back, LeBron would only let IT run the offense on limited possessions. In fact there were many cases where a CLE player would be ready to inbound the pass, and on one side it would be IT asking for the ball and on the other, James was asking for the ball. Guess who it went to?   IT is a specialist basketball player. At 5'9, you're not contributing almost anything on defense. It's all offense. If he doesn't have the ball in his hands, he's close to useless. And LeBron made him look that way because James wanted to run the offense almost exclusively. It just so happens the moment he gets traded, his numbers go back up. Despite the fact that he was coming off the bench. "
"That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Kyrie Irving moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Chris Paul see the game from an x and o perspective, Kyrie has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event.  There's a reason Kyrie was able to lead LeBron James to the 2016 Finals. Put simply, Irving is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Goran Dragic or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Irving's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like Irving, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Kyrie."
"Dear Lakers fan, Welcome to the LeBron James bullshit circus.   Sincerely, Cavs fan. "
Lebron James signed because he wanted to live in LA.  Don't be delusional like your team was enticing at all to him.
"&gt; I don’t get why it’s so hard for people to understand opportunity cost and how investing works.  This is an absurdly terrible comparison.  Finances are about making money.  It's not a binary system.  You don't need to have the best day of anyone on the stock market to ""win"".  100 good days in a row, even if you only come out marginally ahead each day, is usually considered very wise investing.  Additionally, a dollar bill is a dollar.  A thousand dollars is a thousand dollars.  There aren't some dollars worth more than others, and there aren't stocks that you get to own which prevents everyone else on the market from owning them.  Versus sports, where coming out slightly ahead each day gets you a 6 seed in the playoffs and a first round exit.  Sports ARE binary.  One team wins at the end of each season.  Uno.  You win or you lose your last game.  29 teams don't win.  Getting a guy like LeBron James and then being happy with ""steady progress"" when you only have him for 4 years is not the time to ""play it safe"".  That's idiocy.  &gt;If I told you I’d give you a cake right now (this cake might or might not have gone bad)but I’d take your 3 cupcakes and some candy OR you can wait for a day and you can get this cake for free if not you have other cakes which are almost as good.  &gt;if you have other cakes which are almost as good  &gt;almost as good  &gt;Do some critical thinking and logical thinking and see what’s the best for now and the future and make a decision.  Did you just actually say that Kuzma and Ingram are ""almost as good"" as a top 5 player in the league who was a #3 in MVP voting last year, and then accuse me of not thinking logically?  Fucking lol.  From a flairless Lakers fan.  So fucking typical."
"I'm arguing with someone that is trying to tell me that because the Spurs beat then 2 times in the regular season, they are better. Because it's not like that Cavs team totally coasted through the regular season, it's also like LeBron definitely doesn't play better in the playoffs. What 3 time finals MVP  2 time MVP do the Spurs have on their roster again? The Lakers swept the Spurs last year, I guess they're better than them too. You are trying to sit there and tell me that a team led by LMA and 40 year old Manu Ginobli is better than a team with LeBron James. You. Are. Stupid. "

Well first and foremost players and overall talent. Common logic will tell you that a cavliers team led by LeBron James is better than the 7th seed Western conference team. 
"Haha I think you are overselling the ridiculousness of offering Embiid for Kawhi. Windhorst has a job as THE guy with sources on Lebron James. Whether he knows anything about basketball, if he knows what Lebron is thinking, he has a job."
"Eh.. there’s more to it than that, but you’re right. Any guy who is 6’3”, runs the court well, and has a good shot would be the Lebron James of the WNBA. "
LeBron James 
"“Yet as talented as (LeBron James) definitely appears to be, I don’t believe any nineteen-year-old should be playing in the NBA. These young men grow so dependent on their posse’s, who fetch their cars and their girls, that they can’t possibly develop into mature, self-sufficient human beings. One day, I’m convinced, we’ll find out the true extent of the psychological damage that’s been caused.”  [Phil Jackson, 2004](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/11/phil-jackson-lebron-james-posse-2004-book-cavaliers-knicks-nba/amp) "
"He's a Finals MVP.  Did you not watch that series?  He shut down LeBron fucking James in his athletic prime. He was great even after that series.  The only reason nobody thinks hes as good as he clearly was, was because he was on the spurs.  Having Pop as your coach should not discredit his success.  Its yet to be determined how he will play post injury, but I think he will dominate like he has shown time and time again.  Knowing the bullshit that is sports media, once he is on the Lakers everyone will consider him top 3 no question."
"You're crazy and clearly never watch Kemba Walker. Kemba is perfectly capable of leading a team, and the ONLY way we will ever have a star player is by drafting them. LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, [Insert any other star player name] is never going to come to Charlotte. That's the reality."

LeBron James. 
"I'm not sure where you are getting your stats, but on NBA.com but Rajon is at .87 PPP on PnR Handler on 3.7 possessions per game, and LeBron is at 1.02 at 5.5 possessions. That .87 is basically league average at this.  Of course, that doesn't include plays where the player dishes to an open man. That's not publicly available. But in terms of the PnR Handler shooting -- whether going to the rim or shooting immediatley or off the PnR, James is MUCH more dangerous.  I think it's a huge mistake to move LeBron off the ball, at least in terms of trying to win. You are better off reducing his minutes and getting a second real playmaker.  Having Rondo on the court when LeBron drives in any capacity creates a easy double teamer, because dishing to Rondo away from the rim is not a dangerous position for the defense.  Also, James averaged .2 possessions per game off a screen ... one shot every five games is not exactly anything to be talking about."
Casey was the reason we lost James Johnson. Would never play him and didn’t want him on the team. The man went to Miami and is a beast. We had someone to stop lebron but then we also had Casey the Lebron nut rider.
&gt; literally has lebron james  &gt;  “we have nothing” 
LeBron James Sr. currently ranked #1 in the whole NBA
Lebron and James Johnson 
LeBron James Jr is currently ranked 10th in his class
"Very good but a step down from the regular season.  Part of the thing that hurts his perception is the precedent set by Lebron.  For better or worse the top guy in the league sets the bar in terms of what is expected for greatness.  When it was MJ scoring titles were a lot more important, it least it feels that way.  Now that we have James who kind of coasts through the regular season and really turns it on in the playoffs, and typically finals even further, that is what we expect from the great players and Steph doesn't really do it.  "
"it's whatever draft pick in 2022 that gets you LeBron James Jr.  Not only will he probably be a good player but you'll also get to sign Bron Sr. that offseason, too.  LeCyborg could still be the best player in the NBA in 4 years, anything is possible."
"&gt;Any superstar who takes less than the max is hurting the rest of the players. It creates incentives and narratives that ""Oh, if he wants to win he needs to sign for less cash"". It gives leverage to owners and GM's ""We need to pay you less so we can field a good team around you.""  So what?  That doesn't actually force anyone to take less money.  KD's teammate Steph Curry signed a 200 million dollar max contract last summer.  He didn't take a penny less than the max during a summer when KD took less.  How many players have signed max contracts since KD took a cut?  Curry, Hayward, Westbrook signed a max extension, Harden signed a max extension,  Andrew Wiggins signed a max contract extension, John Wall signed a max extension, Chris Paul, Lebron James, Paul George.  Devin Booker is going to sign a max extension this summer.  Those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.  CP3 took no paycut and the Rockets lost Ariza for it. Guess the ""Oh, if he wants to win he needs to sign for less cash"" narrative just didn't work that well.  The situation now has nothing to do with KD.  The teams that might want to sign these players don't have the money.  And the teams with the money don't want to spend it because they are tanking and they would rather take on salary for picks.  &gt;If every player signed for their max value then we would have less talent concentrated on just a few teams and a more even playing field with more players making the money they should be making.  Its not on individual players to make that happen.  Its on the league and player's union to provide the necessary incentives for the talent to spread around.  Players should be able to sign where they want.   They have free will.  The best the league can do is try to make it very unattractive to players and owners to construct super teams."
"Yes shoe companies pushed Paul George to Oklahoma City instead of the Lakers. It’s the brilliant shoe companies that have made the New York Knicks a pathetic organization for 20 years. They masterminded Lebron James leaving Miami for the attractive, vibrant, and growing megalopolis that is Cleveland."
"&gt;  Even though it sounds like James and 4 pure shooters would be the best possible lineup, I'm not sure that's the case. Need to balance it.  Yeah, but I don't think anybody's arguing that. They just need more shooting that they have now. Of course having another play maker besides just Lebron in beneficial as well as tough, high basketball IQ players who are also good defenders like Rondo. You really have to worry about floor spacing with the current roster imo. "
"Bro, that's different because the cavs already had Lebron. You're using Lebron twice in that scenario making it a Lebron squared type of deal.    It's like me saying ""If the warriors had KD in 2016, they would have beat the Cavs"" and then you saying ""well OKC had KD in 2016 and they still lost"" while ignoring that you are ADDING Lebron to a team that lost close games.  It's difficult to explain but it's like:  Lebron makes your team 30 percent better (random number). Lakers without Lebron were a 50 percent. Lakers with Lebron are an 80 percent. Lakers win close games.  The cavaliers without Lebron james would've just lost more games and those close games would've been blowouts.  That's not the case for the Lakers."
"""I don't know anything about Angola, but Angola is in trouble."" - ~~Charles Barkley~~ LeBron James"
"Curry is an awesome playoff performer and obviously anyone should trust him. I attribute the narrative that he's a disappointment in the playoffs to his extremely high degree of difficulty on offense that makes his off nights look historically bad and hard to forget - i.e his game 2 in the 2015 finals and game 3 this past finals, despite being excellent otherwise.   It's also clear to me that his finishing isn't as effective in the postseason, whether that be due to the increased physicality that is allowed by the officiating or his increasing fatigue level as the season progresses (we see this effect James Harden just about every PS). Obviously isn't the most durable guy, and injuries appear to affect him more so than the likes of Durant and LeBron who play through them."
"Luke Walton talking about ""we really got LeBron James"""
"We picked D'Lo over the near consensus pick in Okafor. Look how that turned out. Okafor would have completely fucked us.  Randle was the 7th pick and is looking like a potential all-star (best case scenario obv). The players picked directly after him are Stauskas, Vonleh, Elfrid Payton, Doug McDermott. Also, he's gone because even better options arose when we signed freakin Lebron James (cuz we might actually be able to sign more stars now).  Lonzo pick is looking fine, he completely transforms our team for the better on both ends whenever he plays and is a good fit alongside all these wings."
"Did you actually watch Bird play growing up? Maybe you're just being nostalgic, but regardless the 80's were by no means this super difficult defensive era just because of the existence of the Pistons. More physical era =/= harder era, the pace was way higher back then than it was now too. Plus even if it were true, this'd make your argument worse. Playing good defence in an era where it's very easy to score is harder than playing good defence in an era where it's harder to score. Shutting down Nash in O4 would be much easier and less impressive than shutting him down in 05. I'm supporting YOUR argument by correcting you here man. Yay for intellectual honesty.   PLUS, the era is irrelevant anyway, as I was talking about immediate competition.  And what are you talking about. 1st Team All Defence is better than 2nd Team All Defence. 6 is better than 3. 5/15 1st Team All Defence is objectively better than 3/9 2nd Team All Defence because bigger numbers are better than small numbers. If i'm not being nice to Bird, than it's 5/15 vs 3/13, which is even worse. Not sure what point you were trying to make in regards to his injury.  And dude what dumpster fire defence are you referring to? Lebron was bad, not horrible, but bad these past two year in his 14TH AND 15TH seasons, which Bird didn't even make it to, and from 04-06. So Bird was a good defender for 9 of his 13 seasons, and Lebron was a good and BETTER defender, for 10 of his 15 seasons. If your argument is that 69%&gt;66%, therefore Bird is better, than that's just treating Bird's lack of longevity as a positive, which would be stupid.   I mean, lets ignore the team selections as they're based on reputation too anyways. Lebron James is both much faster and stronger than Bird and even though it's not his best strength defensively, is a very good on ball defender, something which can't be said about Bird. In his prime it was no question, but even in the last few years of his career, he's been capable of being a good on ball and 4th quarter defender whilst guarding other All Stars. The only player he really dropped the ball on was Durant, who is Durant. At what point in Birds career was he an excellent on ball defender whilst simultaneously being a great team defender like LBJ? He couldn't even guard opposing small forwards 1 on 1 let alone guards.   Furthermore, Bird had 3 other teammates on his team that made the All NBA defensive team during his career, with 2 of them getting more selections than him. That's 3 other players that can pick up your slack and make your job easier as a defender. Lebron has played with 0 All NBA defensive teammates during his 2nd stint on the Cavaliers. So Lebron is having to do more on offence, whilst playing with worse defenders as teammates too, whilst being in seasons Bird wasn't even durable enough to reach. Lebron has also NEVER played with a teammate that had more defensive team selections than himself.   and are you seriously telling me that the Bird that needed to get his spine re-aligned inbetween games was a better defender than 2017-18 Lebron? I highly doubt that.    So to conclude, despite the fact that Lebron has to expend more energy on offence and has never played with teammates that are as good defensively as Bird's were, you think that Lebron, who was a much better defender at his peak, a better defender for longer period of time and a better defender on average, who is also much faster, stronger and more athletic than Bird, and has DOUBLE the amount of defensive team selections than Bird has, whilst being compared to better defenders than Bird was, is a worse defender than Bird?

"LeBron James leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to their first title after being down 3-1 to the defending champion Golden State Warriors, who were coming off a 73-9 season, with unanimous MVP Stephen Curry."
"Well let's be honest there is only one contender right now.  This is a great reason to do away with max contracts though. Lebron James makes the max. So does Andrew Wiggins. So does Blake Griffin. These guys range from very good to GOAT, but the cost to their teams is exactly the same. If you're just unlucky enough to get stuck with one of those very good players your team is basically fucked. You have crazy cap space to keep them or just let them walk and start over while other teams are getting Brons and Hardens and Currys for the same price.   The *only* argument against getting rid of max contracts is that it leaves less for the guys in the middle. But I don't think it would be *that* significant. Nobody is going to offer LeBron 80 million a year. And if they do so be it but they're retarded. The only player in football that is even close to as valuable as a top tier NBA player is a franchise QB. We don't see any of them eating up 50% of the cap or anything like that, despite the fact that there are no max contracts. "
"I hate to break it to you, but his personal life has no bearing on what we regard him as on the court. The dude is a problem, he is delusional and ignorant and that's why he's so confident. Seriously, who the fuck call sout teammates when you're playing with LEBRON JAMES. When he had a good year with the Celtics he believed in the hype and lives vicariously through it. He's clearly talented, but his defense is laughable. Unless he changes his attitude and his approach he's going to be a dude who's never going to find a team and a bunch of low to mid tier teams will give him chances and he'll blow them all."

It seems appropriate then to consider the case of the Federal lawsuit recently filed in Chicago: Craig Hodges vs. the National Basketball Association, in which Hodges said that ''the owners and operators of the 29 N.B.A. member franchises have participated as co-conspirators'' in ''blackballing'' Hodges from the league ''because of his outspoken political nature as an African-American man.''  In 1992, after 10 seasons in the N.B.A., Craig Hodges, at age 32, was not re-signed by the team he had played with for the previous four seasons, the Chicago Bulls, who had just won their second straight championship. Hodges had been a backup shooting guard for the Bulls, and was still considered one of the better 3-point shooters in the league.  When the team went to the White House after an invitation from President Bush, Hodges wore a dashiki, and handed the President a letter that asked him to do more to end injustice toward the African-American community.  The lawsuit alleges that the incident embarrassed the N.B.A. It alleges that Hodges's work to curb ''the breakdown of the African-American family'' with Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam was also seen as inimical by the N.B.A. As was Hodges's public criticism of ''African-American professional athletes who failed to use their considerable wealth and influence to assist the poor and disenfranchised.''  Continue reading the main story Advertisement  Continue reading the main story Hodges, meanwhile, was fired two weeks ago as the head coach at Chicago State University, as he seemed to be giving more time to his lawsuit and community affairs than to campus duties while his team went 8-51 in a little more than two seasons.  ''After the 1992 season,'' Hodges said, ''I or my agent had called every team in the N.B.A. and not one would even give me a tryout, let alone sign me.''  The Bulls didn't re-sign him, according to one team official who asked for anonymity, ''because he was on his last legs as a player.''

In his last season for the Bulls, Hodges played in only 53 of the team's 82 regular-season games. The Bulls signed Trent Tucker, a better defender than Hodges and a higher percentage 3-point shooter.  ''I thought we improved ourselves there,'' said Phil Jackson, the Bulls' coach. ''I had the highest regard for Craig, though. He was a great team player, never caused any problems and I respected his views. I'm a spiritual man, and so is he. But I also found it strange that not a single team called to inquire about him. Usually, I get at least one call about a player we've decided not to sign. And yes, he couldn't play much defense, but a lot of guys in the league can't, but not many can shoot from his range, either.''  In the lawsuit, Billy McKinney, the director of player personnel for the SuperSonics, who is black, is quoted as having first voiced interest in Hodges in 1992, and then shortly after backing away, telling Hodges he could do nothing because ''brothers have families, if you know what I mean.''  Contacted recently, McKinney passed on a message: ''No comment.''  ''I never heard of any conspiracy whatsoever,'' said Wayne Embry, the president and chief operating officer of the Cleveland Cavaliers, who is also black. ''I'm sure I would have if there was one. And in a league that has about 80 percent black players, it's hard to charge racism.''  David Stern, the commissioner of the N.B.A., said that the idea of a conspiracy against Hodges is ''ridiculous.'' ''I was even at the White House when Craig wore the dashiki,'' he said. ''I thought it looked great, and I told him so.''  Perhaps more real than the allegations is the perception of discrimination, especially among some N.B.A. personnel. ''It's well known through the league that there may be repercussions if you speak out too strongly on some sensitive issues,'' said Buck Williams, a forward for the Knicks and the respected head of the players association. ''I don't know if Hodges lost his job because of it, but it is a burden when you carry the militant label he has.''  Yet such star nonconformists as the bizarre Dennis Rodman and the frequently tasteless Charles Barkley are tolerated and even celebrated. Clearly, then, the dangers of expression in the N.B.A. have less to do with personal stances than with simply being a fringe player.

Here's PER's top 20 list for this season:  1.	James Harden • HOU	29.8 2.	Anthony Davis • NOP	28.9 3.	LeBron James • CLE	28.6 4.	Stephen Curry • GSW	28.2 5.	Giannis Antetokounmpo • MIL	27.3 6.	Kevin Durant • GSW	26.0 7.	Damian Lillard • POR	25.2 8.	LaMarcus Aldridge • SAS	25.0 9.	Kyrie Irving • BOS	25.0 10.	Karl-Anthony Towns • MIN	24.9 11.	Russell Westbrook • OKC	24.7 12.	Clint Capela • HOU	24.5 13.	Nikola Jokic • DEN	24.4 14.	Chris Paul • HOU	24.4 15.	Enes Kanter • NYK	24.0 16.	Jimmy Butler • MIN	23.7 17.	Victor Oladipo • IND	23.1 18.	Andre Drummond • DET	22.9 19.	Joel Embiid • PHI	22.9 20.	DeMarcus Cousins • NOP	22
"As you said, goldfish mentality could also turn in their favor.   Oladipo, CP3, Demarcus, Eric Gordon all flipped their stock in under a season.  KD can also be seen this way( any controversy is a good controversy).   If Kawhi Balls out in the Play offs, he will recover the lost Spurs fans.   https://www-forbes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/04/30/nikes-lebron-james-is-the-nbas-best-selling-shoe-salesman/amp/?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQCCAE%3D#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkurtbadenhausen%2F2018%2F04%2F30%2Fnikes-lebron-james-is-the-nbas-best-selling-shoe-salesman%2F  Even after moving to GS, Durant is still 3rd best seller over Curry."
"I think the fact the Spurs were asking for value equivalent to ""Kawhi Leonard AND Lebron James"" speaks to why this had to be public. Kawhi isn't going to let snakes like Buford and Pop gut his destination before he gets there. "
"He gets drafted to the Raptors and tears it up only to get beaten in the finals by Lebron James Jr Sr. Toronto signs him to a super max 10 year contract citing ""The Prophecy"" right after LeBron James Jr Sr retires so that none of the James bloodline will ever beat them again. Newly retired billionaire LeBron James Jr Sr then purchases the newly impoverished Toronto Raptors and moves them to Akron."
"Space Jam 2: Ethereal Boogaloo Run time: 180 mins.  Synopsis: Basketball Hall of Famers Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant land in serious trouble when a game of 1-on-1 becomes deadly. Their souls are sentenced to play basketball in purgatory until they can defeat the St. Simon Snakes, led by Kevin Durant and Boogie Cousins. How will their souls pass if they don’t even pass to one another? LeBron James and Jack Nicholson make surprise cameo appearances.  Review: Meh/10 stars"
"LeBron James is not the best player on this league. Outside of the playmaking ability (make everyone better which is not true) that people take to say he is better than Durant, there is no other aspect or the game in wich he is better than Durant. He is not good at defense. Durant ouplays him on the finals."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Carmelo Anthony.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Melo in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Carmelos's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest Scorers ever, and one of the 50 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Tyler Johnson is better than Carmelo Anthony, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Melo in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Melo is better.  You might be jealous of Carmelo’s sick hats, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Denver fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, or a Knicks fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Carmelo isn't even a top 1000 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Carmelo talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Yeah but I'm talking about Max level future free agents, players already on the team, and fans, specifically. I would also argue a few anecdotal stories doesn't suggest that players/agents don't care about reputations. If we're doing that I could just say look at how Paul George signed a 4 year deal with the Thunder or how Lebron James just signed with the L.A Lakers. "
"James Harden and LeBron James are the epitome of efficiency. Don't even try to compare Westbrook to those two, they are not on the same level.   Westbrook has historic usage rate and historic inefficiency, literally the most overrated (super)star I've ever witnessed. Never ever have I seen a player put his personal achievements over team success as much as RW.   He's very interesting player to watch, though. "
"Yes, the Rockets, Spurs Thunder, and Celtics should look in the mirror and think about all the times they went wrong. And the Cavs* too, what were they thinking adding that LeBron James dude and Kevin Love to Kyrie Irving, shouldn't they have known they'd get beat in 5?  (*Cavs made a ton of bad decisions, but they still had a superteam around the best player on the planet at one point. the other four teams haven't been perfect but are very well managed)."
"Knicks are 1 All-Star away from making some noise, both LA and Knicks finished 11th last year....now LA is in talks of a playoff run (I understand It’s LeBron James but still) "
Steve Nash. John Stockton. Chris Paul. Lebron James. Magic. 
10k for a Lebron James jersey... damn son
In the same hospital as LeBron James. And delivered by the same doctor
"According to ESPN's Michael C. Wright, Kawhi Leonard's ""preferred destination"" is the Clippers. Wright has covered the Spurs about as well as anyone, so this is noteworthy. He says that Kawhi wants to be the man and may not want to play with LeBron James. Wright added that Kawhi's people in New York kept him away from some of the Spurs brass, so things really aren't going well between the two sides. Jul 5 - 5:53 PM Source: Back To Back Podcast"
"Na, nah, hold up. Calling BS on this whole article  This man clapped for the ball on lebron james. For those who dont know and that dosnt make sense: you clap for the ball when you view the guy already with the ball as inferior to you , almost saying 'how dare you not pass me the ball. Give it up scrub.' Players hardly ever do this at the NBA level, and he did this to one of the best players to ever play the game, and within a week of bein on the team  The guy is delusional. Confidence has nothing to do with it. I hope he balls out and makes back some money but he overplayed his hand"
"I'm glad we agree: Sometimes being a GM requires doing some cold moves, but Ainge never even promised IT that he'd be a part of the Celtics future. IT was never a free agent, he never chose the Celtics, Boston traded for him and brought him from a 6th man to an MVP candidate. And they traded him again to upgrade at PG but sent him to play with LeBron James on the Eastern Conference favorite.  It sucks that it didn't work out, but Danny Ainge isn't the bad person that some people (not necessarily you) on this sub pretend that he is because of his GM moves."
You're implying I hate Lonzo or think little of him. Fact is Rondo/Lonzo is a weird combination with LeBron James. Whether it works or not isn't the point as much as the fit being awkward. 
So James Harden = bad? LeBron = bad?
Bro when there is a complete difference in plus minus then there is something wrong. If LeBron James had been benched they would have won the series
"I mean, Michael Jordan at best would make the all-star team in this era  MJ hasn’t faced any of these ballers in his era: •LeBron James •Kevin Durant •Steph Curry •Kawhi Leonard •Giannis Antetokounmpo •Kyrie Irving •Anthony Davis •Kristaps Porzingis •James Harden •Russell Westbrook •Chris Paul •Paul George •Damian Lillard •Klay Thompson *etc.  Also, Steve Kerr told a reporter during the finals that he himself wouldn’t stand a chance in today’s basketball ~&gt; that says a lot because Steve Kerr was a key piece to the 95-96 Bulls who were known as the best team in history before the Warriors took the NBA by storm  That’s my 2 cents, this 1’s for free "
"[Hall of Famer Nate Thurmond](http://www.blogdebasket.com/files/nate_thurmond.jpg) shares a freakish physique, a hairline and quite possibly some DNA in addition to being from the same town as Lebron James."
"Rockets take the Warriors to 7 without Lebron, and you replace Ariza with Lebron and you don't even think they have a shot? The cap situaation is complicated but they could have kept Capela (see below)  [https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/12/11/16761746/lebron-james-rockets-free-agency-salary-cap-how](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/12/11/16761746/lebron-james-rockets-free-agency-salary-cap-how)  Or you could help me understand why I'm wrong without insulting me. We are lakerbros bro"
Lebron James will be the Point Center for the team.
"I started watching the NBA last year and it's so awesome that I get to see great players like James Harden and LeBron James play the game. Harden's offensive power makes him one of the top 3 guards in the league and his defense got better, too. LeBron's greatness makes me think about jumping on the Lakers bandwagon. I am very interested what impact LeBron will have in LA. "
You get dunked on by your chain of command everyday  but they’re not LeBron James. 
"&gt;Scoring: ~~equal~~ Jordan  &gt;Shooting: ~~Bron~~ Jordan  &gt;Defense: ~~LeLMAO~~ Jordan  &gt;Stamina: ~~Lebron~~ Jesus fucking christ, Jordan was known to play a round of golf (when weather permitted) **and** lift weights before games... all the while playing close to the entire game.  &gt;Adding value to an ~~team~~ entire sport: ~~Mr James~~ Michael Jeffrey Jordan"
I assure you that LeBrn James only has 1.  It's a shame his name is LeBrn and not LeBron
"So trading IT to the LeBron James led Cavs who were favorites to go back to the Finals was “kicking him to the curb”? That makes no sense whatsoever.   IT could’ve done whatever he wanted, sure. But he didn’t sit out, he re-aggravated or worsened his injury, and lost money because of it. Because of his choice. Ainge didn’t force him to play, and the trade to Cleveland had zero impact on the fact he was already injured. The trade had no impact on him losing money. Just the injury, which, once again, was completely his doing. Trust me, I appreciate what he did for the team, but I’m sick and tired of acting like Ainge betrayed IT or ruined his career or whatever else people like to make up about the situation.  "
"Michael Jordan has  TWO of the letters in his name that spell GOAT,  LeBron James only has ONE. (Edit: I can't count)  Fax.  Which is why I believe  Giannis Atetokounmpo is destined to be GOAT since he has ALL FOUR."
"47% FG% actually understates how efficient he was. He had 63% TS%, league-leading in 16-17 along with KD, LeBron and Curry, and with higher volume than any of them. He was getting to the line as often as James Harden and also shooting a similar proportion of 3s as Curry. Then if you take out the 3s, his 2PFG% was comparable to LeBron's. It was an absolutely unbelievable season for someone of his size and career record."
"OP makes a great point LAL failure to sign PG will come back to kill them bc all other options, including Kawhi and his stupid uncle, are not enough to get by GS before James is done.  It's already over Lakers so just enjoy the LaVar-LeBron soap opera it's all u got.  "
"“LeBron James is a Laker?” Nerd-12 said of LeBron's Decision. “That f***ing GOAT boomed me.” Nerd-12 added, “Just straight to Lakers? Without any All Stars?,” repeating it four times. He said he wanted to add LeBron James to the list of NBA stars he expected more from."
"For real. LeBron has a bunch of dudes who clearly love being around him to the point that they went to Cleveland to play with him - Miller, James Jones, Birdman, Perk, D Wade... and that doesn't even include guys like JR and Cedi and Korver who rave about playing with him."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/lebron-james-rich-paul-basketball-decision-los-angeles-lakers-76ers-simmons-nba-free-agency-challenge-video/amp  Rich Paul just said he chose LA over sixers and other teams for basketball reasons.  He has faith in magic, the core, and himself  Also just a month ago people ridiculed lakers fans for thinking we had a shot because it was LA.   "
"Wouldn't the proper way to do this be:  PG Jerry West (25,192)  SG Kobe Bryant (33,643)  SF LeBron James (31,038)  PF Pau Gasol (20,776)  C Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (24,176)  That way everyone is actually playing in position. Still a damn good team too.  Not sure if using career totals was the intended way to go about it, but I'm not too great at finding more specific stats."

Kobe couldn't hang or bang with LeBron. Anyone that disagrees just a Kobe dick rider. LeBron is bigger faster stronger better post player better contact dunks and layups better defender longer and younger and at this point he is a better shooter with better shooting percentages #fax king of la. Greatest to ever wear a Laker uniform the king James
"James Johnson until he joined the Heat.   I also believe in my heart that Michael Beasley was misused. Dude never had a chance to develop on a team; he was looking good on the Heat, then he got dumped in the Lebron and Bosh signings. Every team that he has looked promising on, they cut ties with him and he has to start all over again."
It was a Lebron James jersey. Then a couple months later my uncle sent me a Lebron James highschool jersey.

"Yeah, because the Jazz obviously have Lebron James ..."
Because the Cavs had Lebron James. The Jazz have Donovan Mitchell. 
TIL the Utah Jazz have Lebron James
"See, I’ve thought about this a lot.  My theory is that the WNBA isn’t nearly advertised or hyped as much as the NBA is. When a big match is being hyped up in the NBA, I knew about it, whether it be the Spurs and Heat or the Heat and OKC: I knew when it was happening, even if I didn’t want to. (I started following the NBA seriously in like 2015 or 2016)  There’s also a very deep connection with other media sources like news channels, YouTube channels, EVERYONE talks about the NBA, and I think that the WNBA needs to try to go about presenting itself at all.  Even writing this comment, I don’t even know if the WNBA season is going on, who won the last championship, where I can tune in or a single “Lebron James” of the WNBA or a single team name.  I think that consciously addressing this issue could turn the WNBA into more profitable and popular league, and I think that now is the perfect time to attempt that progression. The Warriors are going to probably going to threepeat this coming season and  casual interest is pretty low because of this fact, and I think that this could become thriving league of its own in the shadow of Golden States tyrannical reign over the NBA.  TLDR; I think the problem with the WNBA is an issue with advertising and can be fixed if the right actions are taken, and now is the perfect time because GS just signed Boogie, while we have an unknown league which can lead to truly exciting basketball and a great league."
"First, I didn't use the term bandwagon, but it's hilarious that your mind went there.   Second, the point was not that he doesn't post up much. You literally said he ""doesn't have a post game."" I'm actually quoting you there. He doesn't post up much because he doesn't have to, but he's incredibly efficient when he does.   Finally, I'll quote some guy named Zach Lowe:   ""James has become so much more since. He might be the league’s most vicious post-up player, too strong for wing defenders and unguardable when his big-man teammates aren’t mucking up the paint.""  http://grantland.com/the-triangle/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-aftermath-miami-heat/"

"The problem is they aren't problem solving this properly. Painting over the mural in white is clearly a win-lose solution.  What we need here is a classic Michael Scott win-win-win solution.

That way he doesn't have to see Lebron James, but everyone else can admire the painting on the t-shirt when he walks by.  Win, Win, and Win.   "
Let's be real. The biggest problem was that LeBron James wasn't trying very hard.  You think LeBron would get blown out by 30 by the raptors in the playoffs even if IT were still there? Dude was probably already planning his LA business moves in the middle of the regular season.

"When I met the Cavaliers after the midseason trades in 2017  I was with a group of friends...like 6 or 7 guys and probable 2 girls.  Kevin Love looks right at our group, makes a shooting motion with his arms, and yelled ""There you go!""  Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. J.R. Smith belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
It was a bar on a beach. It's funny because Cavs warriors finals were on tv and this was right after he lost to the Cavs (2017). I remember thinking how crazy that must to be watching Lebron James after you just played D on him
"Kevin Durant is more fun to play with than LeBron James isn't even close to be being true from a basketball sense. Shut up, Bill. "

"I remember a graphic from his first season back comparing stats based on his gear (sweatband, sweatband and shooting sleeve, shooting sleeve only, etc). [Found it!](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/9/7/9272241/stats-lebron-james-accessories-headband-arm-sleeves-nba-graphic)"
"I mean I think just judging by the All Stars I'd put Bron at Top-3.   1. Klay, Steph, KD, Dray 2. CP3, Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Paul George, Westbrook 5. Anthony Davis  6. Jimmy Butler, Towns 7. (Damien Lillard)  That's already 13. There's technically only 12 spots.   Next year Dray probably doesn't get a spot. And I wouldn't be surprised to see Mitchell over Lillard, but unlikely Gobert joins him.   If Ingram makes another leap, it's possible he passes PG and gets the nod. Probably will help that PG ain't getting any votes from L.A. and Ingram or Kuzma will get a shit ton more.    Unless you mean not like actual All-Stars, but more like *all-stars*.   "
Lebron James - A bag of Ruffles and a finger in the butt
"That feels more like narrative bias than a proven and meaningful difference.   In both cases teams are taking on imperfect contracts to keep title chances alive, with little concern for some wasted money once the window closes.  It’s not like JR and TT seemed replaceable at the time, and Lebron was like “no, sign my shitty friends instead”. They were 3rd and 4th respectively for the Cavs for minutes played that following finals and their minutes go to James Jones and post-surgery Mozgov otherwise."
"6 games is 6 games regardless of how you look at it.   LeBron had 36-13-9. Mozgov had next highest PPG at 14.5 then JR at 11.5 (31.2% FG, 29% from three). Delly put up some gritty defense. I know LeBron had teammates. But their rotation was this:  LeBron  Mozgov  TT  JR  Delly  Shump  James Jones  On the other hand, GS's rotation was largely the same as the 73 win team the next season. The only change was Ezeli on the 2016 squad. LeBron was the only reason they went 6 games. "
"I feel u. I prefer competition myself. I've seen my team win a title, and put on several great battles with lebron james over the years. But if we happened to get bron, kawhi, AND pg this off-season and started breezing through reg seasons and the finals, it wouldn't be as appealing as a neck to neck match up with, say, the 6ers or wizards."
"Last class of my college career, last test of my college career. Had to get like an 80% to pass the class.   Best believe my name was LeBron James that day"
"&gt; With James on the ground in L.A., the Lakers are all but assured to get one of the group of elite players who’ll be unrestricted in 2019  Why? I mean, who tf knows what Kawhi wants, apparently he'd rather be a Clipper than play with Bron. I'm almost certain Klay will stay with GS through his whole career. Maybe he gets Kemba but that's a huge step down from Kawhi and PG.  Idk, it's a weird statement to say just because the Lakers have LeBron now every FA is going to beg to play with him. Dude's gonna be 35 by the end of next season, and Father Time is undefeated."
lol Chris Bosh is 8 months older than LeBron James. He just came off a 24/11 season.  Dwade was 29 and coming off a 26/5/6 season.   These dudes weren't rolling around in wheelchairs.   I don't have to spin anything if the guy I'm debating with has no understanding of the Facts. I suspect you weren't watching during the Heat years.
I now get to say someone out there thinks Carmelo Anthony is better than Lebron James. Thanks for that.
remembered this comment when i saw [this article](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24021479/what-lebron-james-move-los-angeles-means-nike-sneaker-line)
"imagine thinking a top 3 perimeter defender isn't important to a team hoping to contain Kevin Durant, James Harden, and LeBron James in their own conference"
"&gt;LeBron James Celebration will also feature the introduction of the G.O.A.T. Burger. The half-pound burger will have two steak burger patties, topped with whipped goat cheese, apple cider bacon jam, frizzled onions, and blackberry barbeque sauce. It will sell for $12 at the Taters concession stand. The team will also sell its famous giant ice cream sundae, The Screamer, for a special $23. The Screamer is made up of 21 scoops of premium ice cream on top of a brownie base and finished off with chocolate syrup, bananas, whip cream, sprinkles and maraschino cherries.  This sounds good tbh "
"[I was referring to the Lakers, you're right that he may want to play for the Clips](http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/lebron-james-lakers-kawhi-leonard-trade-clippers-76ers-nba-trade-news-free-agency/404wjiko0ock13h6g96vxhjk3)  But Vegas has us as the favorites to trade for him right now, and they are generally the closest to right of anyone who predicts these things"
Maybe some people actually think James worth is the best player lol.   And if Dow people troll it wouldn’t matter at all. If James worth gets 200 votes but lebron and MJ get 3000 the trolls are irrelevant   Why are you trying to limit opinion? Not having wit or bird as even possible 3rd best ever is pretty hard to justify. I’m sure many people would choose them. Maybe not a majority but the point is you should let the data lead you. Don’t try and lead the data. 
"Steph Curry, LeBron James"
Then Steph Curry takes a paycut and cousins resigns for only 120% of his 5.3 Mil MLE and they grab LeBron once he's done in LA &amp; sign Ayesha Curry and Bronny James.
Unfortunately James has lost finals and he’ll be remembered for that. MJ was lucky to have an incredible group that helped win it all. All of that plus Warriors and Steph unanimous MVP year against his trophy. It’s just too hard. With all that said. I prefer what LeBron has achieved and the way he did it.
You do when that player is LeBron James. His best teammate was Mo Williams. You don’t win rings when Mo is your second option
"&gt; who wins the race  LeBron James. Dude is a freak athlete and sack racing would be right in his wheelhouse. However, he doesn't finish in as good a time as either Jordan or Kobe did when they participated, so he never hears the end of it on social media.  &gt; who finishes last  Chris Paul, who was doing amazingly but got hurt right at the end of the race and was unable to finish.  &gt; who gets disqualified   JaVale McGee for accidentally hopping right onto CP3's back and injuring him."
"The US has by far the largest GDP in the world today. Where were they ranked in the early 1800s? Because if it's not #1, then you can't compare trade wars then and now. Intro to economics.   Since this is r/nba, I'll put it in terms you should be able to comprehend:   Who has more leverage in contract negotiations, lebron James or some no name g-league player? "
Eh. I see that series going 6/7 games even without Kawhi. People underrate us against players who aren't LeBron James.
"Also, in 2001-02, Williamson had a higher usage rate than James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and LeBron James."
"Lebron James, Kris Middleton"
"Celtics fans always point to dealing away Perkins for Jeff Green. I could go on a huge rant about how it was the right call and that there is some major revisionist history going on.  In a nutshell, it was a necessary evil to try and maximize our odds of winning the championship, which were slim.   After Marquis Daniels went down, Paul Pierce was the ONLY small forward on the entire roster, and he was 33 and aging fast. At center we just had to roll the dice that Shaq might stay *kind of* healthy (he didn't), and/or that we would be able to get solid center minutes out of Jermaine O'Neal and Nenad Krstic.   We were relatively fine at center, but SF was a **far** more critical position. If we didn't trade for Jeff Green, then Pierce would have had to play literally like 45 mpg during the playoffs. Seriously, go back and look at that roster; the only other player who could even **pretend** to play SF was Sasha Pavlovic, who scored 31 points the entire season.  -  But the biggest thing wasn't finding a new SF on offense, it was getting another body on DEFENSE. Without trading for Green, Pierce would have had to guard the following players on defense during the playoff run (in addition to carrying the load on offense):  * 1st round: Carmelo Anthony *(their starting center was Ronny Turiaf)*  * 2nd round: LeBron James *(their center was Joel Anthony)*  * Eastern Finals: Luol Deng in his prime  -  Getting another small forward was an absolute necessity."
"LeBron James, Michael Jordan"
LeBron James
"&gt;LeBron on that Houston team instead of harden gets ran even with a healthy Paul.  Ok, so you're basically saying that Harden is a much, much better player than LeBron James?  Are you really that slow?"
Lebron James 
Everyone showboats.  Lebron refers to himself as king james lmao!  Very humble of him huh.    You complain about klays comments but lebron is constantly throwing his team under the bus.  Smh
Remember when the Lakers drafted Lebron James and Kareem? 
....Lebron James
Lebron James vs the whiteboard 
"OG and Siakam played him as well as almost anybody could but it takes a team effort to defend against LeBron. Forced him into a lot of contested mid-range fade-aways, which is close to the best-case scenario you can hope for guarding against LeBron 1v1.   The rest of the team didn't know when to help vs not help. Every time they helped it lead to a wide open shot from one of their better shooters. Every time they didn't help LeBron got a decent shot off. The failure was in team defensive adjustments, not one or two defenders. Check out how Warriors use deterrence as a strategy against LeBron even when he has Steph ISO'd onto him Draymond, Iguodala, Klay, are near perfect in spacing to prevent clean drives while still being able to recover in case of a pass to the perimeter.   GSW also almost always has 4 decent/passable switch defenders while Curry is on the floor (even McGee, and Looney were decent against James). Toronto meanwhile always had at least two weakpoints in defense while DeMar + a Big was on the floor. This makes it much easier to run PnR and get good mismatches for setting up drives and ISO plays."
"The problem is that some of us weren't/wouldn't be haters if he didn't have such a shitty attitude. He still thinks he is on Lebron James level and the truth is that he is more D Wade level. Can he still play? Yeah. But he should be willing and happy to take a bench role and come in and score a few points and earn whatever of his 28 mil he can. Instead, he refuses to believe that his play style doesn't fit into todays NBA and thinks he is still an elite level talent. I'm sure the Thunder would have still been willing to overpay him his contract if he would just shut up and color and be the 6th man to come in and score off the bench. Would it still be overpaying for a bench player? Sure! But I think they would have done it. And we actually need it. We don't have a super deep bench and we fall apart offensively when the first unit leaves the floor. I know at least in my group of friends/fans, we aren't haters because we think he is straight garbage. We are haters because he thinks he still plays at an elite level and has a shitty ""me first"" attitude."
For a guy who's been on the decline severely over the past few seasons I wonder why too . I think of he pairs with LeBron and plays the shooter role like Ray Allen and Kyle Korver/James Jones role  he would do really well . 
"Tough question. I can't even fully decide on my choice from this decade, but I'm leaning towards #2, probably because of my bias. That Game 6 against Boston may not be a top 5 LeBron game in terms of pure basketball performance (2007 against Detroit is probably #1), however when you add the context and the narrative and all the pressure and all that; Game 6 against the Celtics in 2012 is the most iconic LeBron performance of all time. It's ""the game"" for LeBron. Maybe ""the title"" and ""the ring"" and ""the series"" is while he was with the Cavs against Golden State in 2016, but this is the single game where everything changed forever. How can stats explain that look in his eyes?   But being more iconic doesn't necessarily mean it is better. So I'm going to go ahead and say that #1, Dirk's game against OKC, is the best performance of the bunch and LeBron in 2007 is slightly better than that one. It's the same thing when the GOAT debate comes up, I think Michael Jordan is, and will probably forever be, the greatest player of all time. But LeBron James is the best player of all time, there hasn't been anything like him and how complete the package is. But greatness is something else. LeBron's game against the Celtics was his greatest individual game, but 2007 against Pistons where he was playing by himself and 9 other players on the court were watching him is his best.  "
"Damn you got them dancing at a wedding? I've definitely never mocked the way my friends dance before.   Or you could just listen to what Kyrie said after he was traded:  &gt; Kyrie Irving called playing for three years with LeBron James on the Cavs ""awesome,"" and told Boston reporters Friday that ""I'd be telling you guys a lie if I didn't tell you how much I learned from that guy.  &gt;""And I've had the unique opportunity to play with one of the greats, and it was awesome,"" Irving said. ""At times it was all over, just like it is in any other team, and when you look back and you're eternally grateful for the moments that you had and you shared, you're able to put peace with that journey and start anew.""  &gt;""And now that I'm sitting here. It just echoes in terms of me just being very appreciative of not only the Cleveland fans, all of Ohio, but as well as Bron for incorporating me into that special team that we had in Cleveland.""  &gt;""But, they all know how I feel about them individually as well as the love that we have for one another. The brotherhood exists even without all this, and will continue. So, that's exactly where it is. And I'm very appreciative of it."" "

Here's a little fact for you that should shut you up.  James Harden 2017-18 average free throw attempts per game = 10.1 on 20.1 FGA.   Lebron 2017-18 FTA average per game last season = 6.5 on 19.3 FGA.   So James Harden got to the free throw line almost 4 more times per game on almost the same # of field goal attempts. 
"Harden is a great player on a great team.  LeBron is a legendary player on a bad team.  Great team went 7 games against another great team.  Bad team gets swept by a great team.  Without James Harden, the Rockets still make the playoffs. He just helped them get the #1 seed.  Without LeBron James, the Cavaliers are a lottery team. He had to carry them to the finals on a historically great playoff run.  Delete this."
Did you really make this entire post just to try to say that James Harden is better then Lebron
James harden faced the same amount of top ten players this year as Lebron. And all of them were on the warriors.
"Michael Jordan as a young defender was not amazing. LeBron James was not either. The evolution of their defensive prowess on the professional level took coaching, effort, research and experience. I'm looking for an article depicting the early years of Jordan on defense. His growth was wild over the 86 to 88 season, turning him into a lockdown defender, improving his fundamentals, and his reads on defense became smarter.   We will just have to see what happens with Devin Booker. Several players took leaps in their 3-4 years on the defensive end around these times. "
"Why would he have any reason to love Ty Lue, a fired Griffin, and Lebron ""father figure"" James? "
"Judging by your post history, it’s fairly easy to come to the conclusion that the poor arguments you’re using to put harden on the same level as Lebron are an attempt to validate your opinion that KD is better than Lebron.  What were James Hardens stats against the Warriors since the crux of your argument is that “he performed better against the warriors”?  "
&gt; 2018 Lakers after realizing this man named LeBron James was the one responsible for Cleveland's success and not Timofey Mozgov  fuck dude. secrets out. 
"James is right outside the top 5 unless you omit Kawhi from the list because of injury.  When healthy the top 5 is LeBron, KD, AD, Curry, Kawhi  Then you have Harden at 6. If you take out Kawhi then Harden is at 5"
LeBron James
"LeBron James has given up on winning titles by moving to the Lakers when he knew PG wasn't coming with. Houston was available to win right now, Philly and Boston were available to win now *and* push for a dynastic run for years to come. Even Denver offered the opportunity to build around an elite group of young players.  But no, he picks LA and Rondo and Lance and Javale with the hope that those guys will be outplayed in camp by Ingram and Ball and Kuzma and that in a year's time they'll be able to get a star in free agency *and* that LeBron will still be the best player in the world at 35 years old (which he will be in December 2020).   Like Windhorst and Golliver have said, LeBron going to LA was waving the white flag to the Warriors, admitting that KD outmaneuvered LeBron, and that he'll be stuck with 3 titles and nice beaches for the rest of his career."
"I think you're forgetting the fact that the warriors were the best defensive team last season. Also, dont act like curry elevated his game, harden and curry both played around the sameish during that playoff series. Its hard to produce similar results against better defensive teams unless your name is lebron james"
Lebron James has 2 mothers
"James catches, puts up a three. Won't go. REBOUND BOSH, BACK OUT TO ALLEN HIS THREE POINTER....BANG  That moment gets the glory, but man that game was insane. Spurs with a big lead and lots of Heat fans leaving early to later see the Heat came back but they weren't allowed back in. Then LeBron going off after his headband got knocked off to bring them back. What a series. "
"I'm reading the comments and it's odd. Most don't have context to LeBron's popularity. He is the first of his kind. He came into the league as the frontier to the media age. LeBron was a star since 16. His high school games were on ESPN. High school teammates had a documentary about them before he'd even reached his prime: [More Than a Game (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286821/) The scrutiny his career has experienced is beyond any other athlete in existence due in large part to him embracing the expectations, after his high school \*junior (\*not senior) season:  &gt;James was tagged as ""The Chosen One"" on the SI cover, and the story [profiled the then-high school junior](https://www.si.com/vault/2002/02/18/318739/ahead-of-his-class-ohio-high-school-junior-lebron-james-is-so-good-that-hes-already-being-mentioned-as-the-heir-to-air-jordan) and his rise to the top of the prep basketball scene   &gt;   &gt;""I was worried, that we were going to ruin the kid’s life by putting him on the cover,"" SI writer [Grant Wahl](https://www.si.com/author/grant-wahl), who wrote the cover story on James, [told Jesse Washington of The Undefeated](https://theundefeated.com/features/cover-stories-lebron-james-sports-illustrated-2002-all-star/) back in 2017. ""It’s one thing to do a feature on somebody inside the mag. But when you put a young kid on the cover and proclaim him ‘The Chosen One’ – maybe ‘ruin his life’ is a little strong, but it took things to such a level that I felt like his life was not going to be the same after that. The pressure would get a lot higher.""  Sebastian Telfair [was also on a cover.](http://dsz7vodgjx60a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bil-telfair.jpg)  It was only SLAM magazine, not the world renown Sports Illustrated. He also was drafted into the league from high school. He also had a documentary about his decision to forgo college. He is also out of the league. The pressure was high, and he couldn't meet it at all. I rooted for him like I rooted for LeBron. Many root for LeBron because of these expectatins and hoped which he has met, but the backlash is the expectations don't stop just because he goes quiet or says the ""right thing"". Of course he's culpable in his own popularity and drama at times, but not much of the intrigue would be diminished by a lack of personality -- nor would he be himself.  I've watched LeBron's career from the first game. I was in elementary school. He was playing the end of the King's era his first game. LeBron has always been a joker. A lot of younger fan's don't know him as an [egegarious character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAPF09OHkE) \--  &gt;Kobe says, ""Thats Bron though. Thats who he is, man, laughing, joking, he just loves having a good time;[ he's hilarious.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kSc22al4ag)""  he's just *corny hashtags* on tweets &amp; instagram to a lot of younger fans. I recall fans being thrown off by him cussing on here. LeBron is not a Will Smith of basketball. He's a Jay-Z, which is why he is such a controversial figure, because off the court he moves so shrewdly, quietly, and meticuliously, for the betterment of the CBA and himself. The culmination of all these personality traits, his business acumen (being the first superstar of that kind), a long with his political statements, its no wonder the whole world is watching. However, he is being himself. To curb his greatness, his personality, or any other part of himself would be doing the fans a disservice. Yet, everyone next to him is up for attack. YouTube LeBron's mom and [her ex is bashing LeBron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTjoVllks7s). Steph Curry doesn't get this hate. Kevin Durant does not get this level of attention. They're on pne of the most hated teams maybe of all time, two of the other 3 best players in the world who participated in the last season, and no one cares to that degree about their life. Delonte West rumors continue to swirl like they're guranteed facts ([Anatomy Of a Rumor](https://deadspin.com/5544653/anatomy-of-a-rumor-how-the-gloria-jamesdelonte-west-sex-story-went-viral)), despite [how LeBron helped him through hard times. ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-helped-former-teammate-delonte-west-through-stressful-time/) Theres no rumors like that about Anthony Davis, all we know is he smiled too much [while they spanked him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bc2laTUMY8)  Often in threads about LeBron's superstardom and the consequences of it, most note Jordan couldn't exist in this era. He could. He'd just be more Kobe (beloved by players and his city) instead of LeBron (beloved by the world). Jordan and LeBron never cheated the fans out of entertainment, on or off the court, so anyone next to them is going to be hit by the criticism people want to lay on them.  **tldr;** LeBron James is the first American basketball superstar of the social media era and personality &amp; success only amps up the unrealistic expectations no man can control. Those next to him, whether on the court or off, are always going to be subject to a lot of undue criticism."
"You have to view the players in respect to their eras. If you want to look at it as straight up who is the best I could name 10 players better than Kobe in the NBA right now (same goes for Jordan.)The NBA is constantly evolving and improving. The players get better and they’ve all adjusted schematically to fit a brand of basketball that has been proven to be more effective. If you were building a team today I just don’t know how you could justify picking Kobe over Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, etc. "
Up until the washed up LeBron James is a leftover part. Srsly?

"So i was enjoying reading this untill i got to the very last point, stating that the Lakers are getting another ""washed up"" Cavs member in Lebron James. Did you not just witness the same season i did ? cause i saw a man at the age of 33 have one of, if not, the best season of his career... "
Fuck corn and laughter I'm talking bout lebron James ! This motha Fuka ain't even sign with da lakers !
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"&gt; See, now you're just holding your ground. I ask you who the GOAT is and you'd most likely say Tiger Woods because he's the most known, when a lot would argue Nicklaus is the GOAT. But you don't know him so how could you say he was the GOAT.  I don't know anything about golf.  &gt; Logical sense isn't ""MJ is the GOAT because the internet told me so"". Logical sense is going off the information/opinion you know, and I think James is the GOAT because of the information I've seen.  In your first comment you admit that you haven't seen MJ in his entirety; ""I have LeBron as my GOAT because I never watched MJ in his entirety."" so overall doesn't sound like you have enough information to conclude that LeBron is GOAT, you would need more information to determine that.   In terms of logic, you claim that LeBron is the GOAT because you haven't seen MJ in his entirety, by that measure one could then claim Bird or Magic is the GOAT because they did not see MJ or LeBron in their entirety...

"I think the Wizards will finally collapse and Cavs without Lebron is a lottery team so that leaves two new spots open and I think Pistons and Hornets are taking those spots. I don't think Mike Budenholzer will make a **huge**difference with the Bucks since they still lack talent but they will be above 7 seed with Lebron Gone and Giannis continues to rise (with some help from Mike). I see Toronto being deflated but since they are in the East and still have a good bench, they will still be in the playoffs but just lower.   Here is my standings (playoffs only)  1. Celtics 2. 76ers 3. Pacers 4. Bucks 5. Heat 6. Toronto  7. Pistons 8. Hornets  I see the Spurs finally missing the playoffs. I see Anthony Davis having his best season yet which keeps Pelicans in the playoffs. Lebron James does what Lebron James and puts Lakers back in the playoffs. I see Portland being deflated and struggling but still being good enough to keep the team in the playoffs. Without Carmelo, The OKC Thunder will become better and I believe the Timberwolves will find some newfound chemistry so they will hold onto a above low seed this time (if Butler doesn't get injured again of course)   1. Golden State 2. Houston Rockets 3. OKC Thunder 4. Utah Jazz 5. Minnesota Timberwolves 6. Pelicans 7. Lakers  8. Portland Trailblazers     "
"wtf are you talking about alex jones calls school shooting surviors child actors and denies deaths of kid to fit his agenda, skip bayless says lebron james isnt the best at basketball just because it annoys people like you and then people like you tune in to his ""sports show"".

"1995 Heat get: 1999 Jamal Mashburn, 2006 Antoine Walker, 2009 Michael Beasley  1999 Heat get: 2006 Gary Payton, 2009 Dwyane Wade  2006 Heat get: 1995 Kevin Willis, 2011 Mario Chalmers  2009 Heat get: 1995 Harold Miner, 2011 LeBron James  2011 Heat get: 1995 Glen Rice, 1999 Tim Hardaway  Huge blockbuster. Pat Riley style.   1995 makes the playoffs. 1999 doesn’t get bounced by the 8th fucking seed in the first round, but I don’t know about beating the Spurs, it’s possible though. 2006 still wins the title. 2009 is higher than a 5th seed so probably doesn’t get bounced in the first round either by meeting the Celtics later, but probably still losing to them. 2011 wins the title.

"It's LeBron James. He can live in your basement and still make more money than most people in the world. So that's a non issue with him  &gt;  You are a fucking moron if you think he won't be competitive, especially since he's aging like wine, and only getting better. That's also fucking scary"
"Lmao at these Spurs fans talking about ""the Lakers will be under .500 at the deadline with LeBron fucking James on their roster."""
"Signing James Jones. Lebron ""Robin"" James can't win without his Batman."
Giannis is about a reliable Jumper away from being LeBron James. So you're going to give a guy who has the same physical gifts as LeBron . . . Steph's shot? You could just shut down the GOAT debate at that point.

Lakers legend LeBron James
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.golfdigest.com/story/lebron-james-10-most-passive-aggressive-social-media-moments/amp  here's a couple
"""Melo has transformed into a 2nd Lebron James"""
"Those are all the Lebron whisperers, just need James Jones and you have the complete set. Can’t wait for Kendrick Perkins to join the Lakers mid-season too."
Lebron James is the greatest player in the history of the universe.  -ESPN
"Elgin Baylor was a very good player and a lifelong Laker, nobody doubts that. But that guy's stance on Lebron was no LAL rings, no LAL recognition. Elgin Baylor didn't win any rings but he recognizes Elgin's greatness. Therefore, he's being super hypocritical about liking Baylor and not liking James."
"How is that destroying him though?  Elgin Baylor was a career-long Laker. 10x All-NBA First Team, Retired his jersey, and Lakers drafted him #1 after a 19 win season and supposedly saved the franchise according to Minneapolis Lakers owner Bob Short in a 1971 interview with the Los Angeles Times: ""If he had turned me down then, I would have been out of business. The club would have gone bankrupt.""   (You have to remember NBA and the teams weren't the guaranteed money makers that they are today).   I don't get how saying Elgin Baylor should get a statue outside of the Staple Center destroys this guys argument.   I'm too young to have seen Baylor play, but I can at least have respect in for the players and eras  in the generations before my time that enabled what we have today, it was a different league with different measurements of success.    Also as I said, Elgin Baylor was a career-long Laker.   Lebron James hasn't even suited up for the Lakers yet.  Lakers have big expectations and big shoes to fill.  If Lebron doesn't ever win a ring with the Lakers, he's nothing more than a side-note in their history, in the big picture, who gives a shit if he gets them in the playoffs...that's not a big deal in the Lakers legacy."
"That's no fair, he was gifted LeBron James. Is Lue a great coach because he won a championship?"
"I mean, the fact that I can google ""lebron subtweets"" and ""lebron passive aggressive"" and the top two articles contain almost entirely disparate lists of tweets says a lot.  * Arthur hand tweet after a big loss * pretty much all of his #thedc or #dvc tweets * The halloween party where he said that he didn't arrange for any of the warriors stuff  He's constantly doing things in a very public way that clearly are vague and up to interpretation, but he knows he has all this public attention on him. Any time he's asked to explain, he either gives a vague explanation that kinda pans, or he says something along the lines of ""it's for wavy people only, you might not get it"".  It's a pattern of behavior. Sure, the national media blows a lot of it out of proportion, but James does nothing to quell that, only to fuel it."
The name Lebron literally translates to king. King James IS his name 
"If you're a suns fan this season should be soo much better than the last 3, when Earl Watson didnt need any help tanking and they still shut down Bledsoe in the middle of a career year for him, and poor Triano was actually running an offense and they went for the tank again. This year they say they will actually try, but with LeBron going to the Lakers I still have my doubts.   I watch most suns games and there are just questions marks on alot of players, they've had 4 coaches in the past 5 years. Last year Josh Jackson looked way better in the second half of the season because Elfrid Payton isn't terrible at passing and Mike James is, also Josh Jackson and Tj Warren overlap in certain areas especially offensively.   The most important thing this year is to see how the team plays when they are actively trying to win games the Suns have not been as bad as their record has shown, but the playoffs are still probably years away.  TLDR - 3 years. "
LeBron “we need an [expletive] squad” James might push the Lakers FO to go for Kawhi if the Lakers end up being a fringe playoff team going into the trade deadline
KCP was just a medium to pay Rich Paul subtle access to Lebron James. A nice percentage of 30 million over spread  over 2 years was the price to be able to communicate to Lebron James through Klutch Sports. 
"When the greatest player in the world joins the historically greatest franchise in NBA, and makes them relevant again, shit like this happens. Yeh it's about LeBron, because he's fucking LeBron James, and this whole LA Bron thing was the highlight of the off season, and this is the off season.   &gt;  If you are getting annoyed and salty over this simple shit, then you have a very painful road ahead kid. Bron will be a Laker for atleast 4 years.. Get used to it, and stop crying"
"LeBron ""Jonas Jerebko"" James"
I'm not saying he should start nor arguing he should start at C or 3 - just saying he has starter and fringe star potential. Doesn't matter if he starts or not tbh that future outlook doesn't change. That's a 6th starter coming off the bench for LA this season. His best position is 4 and LeBron James will be starting there. 
Is LeBron James Bad For Summer League?
We'll finally see a LeBron James  27-7-7 game. 
"Real good player that gets shut down by tight defense  But! He will thrive in pace and space and of course with the human mismatch, LeBron James"
Josh Hart rips off his mask and it's LeBron James. There are now two LeBron James.
Yes you are making shit up. Lebron just answered the question honestly. What is he supposed to say? Obviously the league was going to look at it they review every technical. The league reviewed the OKC plays not even techs and decided on no action.  I don't care about the CP thing because Draymond does that shit too. On the first play of the series Draymond just shoved James Harden straight up and got no tech for it. Did you want him to be suspended for that too? Or do you only complain when other teams give you guys some shit back?
"You're way off base man.  I'm sorry but LBJ is not as big of a cultural icon as MJ was.  https://themarketmogul.com/the-economics-of-nikes-air-jordan-brand/  &gt;**Jordan himself rates higher than any athlete in consumer perception**, according to market research firm Repucom. He ranks 12th globally. The only other athlete in the top 20 was David Beckham. Jordan’s 98% awareness level in the U.S. is on par with President Barack Obama in the States.  Do you understand how popular David Beckham is globally?  https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattconnolly/2016/05/19/despite-lebron-james-1-billion-deal-michael-jordan-still-king-nike/#e6e6a2a9cd0b  &gt;Both NBA greats earn a cut of the revenue from their sneakers, a practice that is still unique to the industry, but Jordan is second to none when it comes to overall revenue. With 10 times the domestic sneaker sales, it’s clear that Jordan is still making significantly more from Nike than James, not to mention the fact that he is worth exponentially more to the company.""  https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/04/30/nikes-lebron-james-is-the-nbas-best-selling-shoe-salesman/#68cea01c5313  &gt;While James has the top-selling signature shoe, his sales, along with the entire category, are off substantially. “Basketball has fallen from its height of being an important streetwear product to really out of fashion right now,” says NPD Group analyst Matt Powell.  This is all from the last three years.  Lebron is still an active player.  The last time MJ won a championship was 20 years ago.  &gt;By narrative I mean the things that really stick with people. Jordan leaving basketball and then coming back had a similar impact like Lebron leaving Cleveland and coming back. These are the things that normal, non-sports fans remember about MJ and Lebron.  I'm amazed that you're comparing these as one and the same.  You might as well have just compared The Decision to Magic Johnson announcing his retirement and AIDs diagnosis to the world at a time when the term Gay Plague was still a major stereotype.  MJ announcing his retirement shocked everyone.  No one was surprised about LBJ going to form a superteam in Miami.  And the only people who even know about that shitshow are NBA fans.  If you mention The Decision to anyone who experienced both I can guarantee you that the one which proved to be most impactful and shocking was MJ retiring.  The media literally hounded him when he was playing on a farm league team.  You're mistaking the impact of social media in today's society and equating it as success because he's LBJ.  Curry, Westbrook, Harden, KD, plenty of players these days get similar attention from the media.  Lebron is not unique in the fact that the media wonders what he is wearing or who he hangs out with.  And the Witness Commericla is not some huge culturally impactful commercial outside of Basketball.  I have no idea where you get this idea that the average person is even aware of this commercial.  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=michael+jordan+commercial  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lebron+james+commercial  Do me a favor and compare the views on these commercials.  Then, you might just understand how much larger of an icon MJ is compared to where Lebron is now. "
"Ahem...  While it is true that wearing a jersey is symbolic of being on the team, (in this case, the Lakers of Los Angeles, California; heretofor known as 'the Lakers' or simply, 'LA'), the fact that lebron chose not an article of clothing that would represent *HIM* by adorning his namesake  on the back, ('JAMES' in big lettering) but rather choosing the less-represented, more team-driven article of clothing baring both the team colors (the infamous 'purple and gold' that harkens back to famous Titans of the history books; Wilt ""the stilt"" Chamberlain, George mikan, Lew alcindor/Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson, Kobe ""Mamba"" ""Bean"" Bryant, to name a few) and the insignia representative of the Lakers and their sport of choosing, shows just how truly LeBron James has invested into the team.   Also, it probably feels pretty good on his dick. "
"I really don't see Kyrie's request to be traded as anything ""dirty."" In addition to Blatt, Kyrie also found himself on the wrong side of a ""can't say no"" situation. He was THE guy on a young Cavaliers team; he was probably really excited to lead them as he was coming off his injuries. They were getting a young Wiggins, too. But if you're the GM, you'll never say no to Lebron James. In the end, Kyrie was absolutely essential to helping Cleveland win their first title and should have his jersey retired. And no one knows if the reports are true, but didn't it come out that Kyrie wanted out after they won the title. It was only Griffin who was able to convince Kyrie to stay. Once they fired Griffin, Kyrie had no obligation to stay with the Cavs."
Fuck Chris Bosh and Lebron James
CP3 aint a lock at all lol  Steph Curry  Lou Williams  LeBron James  LaMarcus Aldridge  Al Horford
"SF - LeBron James  PG - Steph Curry  PF - LaMarcus Aldridge  SG - Danny Green *  C - Marc Gasol / DeAndre Jordan (he's 30 in 5 days)  EDIT: Wait, fuck that, I'm taking Lou Will over DG."
by calling him LeSuck you are coming of as if you actually doubt Jordan is better than James. Which he is. No need to mock LeBron. Their careers talk by themselves
By all means tell me which of these all stars from 2010 you would put below Wade and Bosh and how they're not in the middle.   You're the only one blatantly distorting facts for the convenience of your bandwagon.   Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Kobe Bryant  Carmelo Anthony  Derek Rose  Dwight Howard  Kevin Garnett  Tim Duncan  Steve Nash  Dirk Nowitski  Paul Pierce  Allen Iverson  Amare Stoudamire  Deron Williams  Pau Gasol  Jason Kidd  Chris Paul
"I'm a blend of JR and Lebron. I've got JRs ability to put up bricks, and throw a game, and I mix that with Lebron's turnovers per game. Except the crazy thing is I don't need to play nearly as many minutes as Lebron to get that many turnovers, so you could say I'm a more efficient Lebron James really..."
"Westbrook has never displayed the instinct you’re talking about. The only example that really stands out is the great defense he played on James Harden that one regular season game. In fact the last time he vowed to shut someone down he ended up not only playing reckless but also really hurting his team in a must win playoff game. At least Lebron has displayed the ability to make crucial defensive plays when it matters most, Westbrook has done no such thing. In fact I would argue that Westbrook’s lack of focus on defense is largely responsible for the game 6 collapse in 2016.   At the end of the day, it pointless to get into the hypotheticals about who would be better “if they tried”. At some point I have to take what I’m given. Curry has been shown to be the better defender, when Westbrook shows me better then It would be fair to re-evaluate "
"Here is a list of body fat percentages of an NBA team's COMBINE:   https://www.nba.com/nuggets/news/2015-nba-draft-combine-recap-anthropometric-stats   Notice that about a third are below 7% body fat. Is it really so hard to imagine that Lebron James, one of the most fit people in the world, is at 6%?   There have been multiple interviews with NBA players who have said numbers as low as 4 or 5 percent.   Moreover, Zyzz was never a ""good"" professional bodybuilder. In the pro bodybuilding circuits, he never won anything major. Zyzz built for aesthetics. He built for an audience, not for competition. "
nope but could you imagine a team trading LeBron James lol
Which of these would you put below Dwayne Wade in 2010? Because I'd put him smack dab in the middle.  Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Kobe Bryant  Carmelo Anthony  Derek Rose  Dwight Howard  Kevin Garnett  Tim Duncan  Steve Nash  Dirk Nowitski  Paul Pierce  Allen Iverson  Amare Stoudamire  Deron Williams  Pau Gasol  Jason Kidd  Chris Paul   
"Westbrook has better running and jumping mechanics than Derrick Rose. His isn't really a natural athleticism but earned through hard work and having the right form.   Remember Russ couldn't dunk until he was a senior in high school, where Derrick Rose was already looking like a mini lebron James"
"Curry is consistently better than westbrook. There's a slight difference. Westbrook pulls that lebron james shit where he drains himself going so hard on offense that he takes breathers on defense, and its apparent in the metrics. But... When westbrook makes an effort (like quoting that he's gonna shut someone down), he's just as good at playing D as he is on offense. Curry doesn't have that next level gear, that killer instinct to take someone out of the game."
"The broadcasters basically didn't talk about Love's pass at all. It was ""what an AMAZING shot by James!"" Which... it was an amazing shot, but c'mon, don't ignore that pass. A little glimpse into what it is like playing with Lebron."
&gt;The best high school basketball player since LeBron James is Jabari Parker  :)

"What makes the 2011 Dallas run so unique as opposed to other championships? Just take a look at the roster they had. Outside of Dirk Nowitzki and Tyson Chandler, they had a bunch of role or below average players on their roster. I know they also had Jason Kidd and Jason Terry, but both were at the end of their careers (I know J.E.T is still somehow in the league). No disrespect to Barrea or Shawn “Ugliest Free Throw” Marion, but who are we kidding? You don’t think you’d win a championship with a team of DeShawn Stevenson, Corey Brewer, Brian Cardinal, Steve Novak, Ian Mahinmi, and Alexis Ajinca on your roster.  The Dallas Mavericks 2011 team was a team that played so well with each other and the cards played out perfectly. This wasn’t a KD, Klay, Dray, and Curry or LBJ, Wade, Bosh superstar team, no. This was a team that won 57 games and *ran* through the Lakers lead by Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Derek Fisher, Lamar Odom, and Metta World Peace. A team that, just a year prior, had won the championship. Ran through an Okhlahoma city team lead by Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Durant, Prime Kendrick Perkins, James Harden, and Thabo Sefalosha. And, to top it all off, ran through a Miami team of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh that was said to be a ‘superteam’. I remember it like it was yesterday, where even when the Mavericks were down 15-20 with 5 minutes left in the quarter, they managed to make a comeback.  A team that had just won its first championship and what does Cuban decide to do? He let’s go of Barrea, Chandler, and signed the headcase that is Lamar Odom who didn’t even want to play for Dallas. And ever since that year, the Mavericks FO has been surrounding Dirk with worse and worse talent, until recently, right as he’s about to retire…"
Yeah a dude with 0 minutes played in the NBA is the most underrated player in the NBA   IMO the most overrated player in the NBA is Lebron James Jr 
Kevin Harlan commentary: “What a play by LeBron James! How will his opponent respond? Find out in 5 minutes or keep playing now for only 5000 VC!”  Reggie Miller: “Welcome to your 2K moment!”
"But it's only 1 game in the context of pure competitiveness, of wins and losses. In that sense, sure, it doesn't matter whether the best player in that game got a 60 point triple-double, or scraped 20 points together in a largely unremarkable way - all that matters is whether it was enough to get the win.  In the context of individual awards, it's not that. It's not just one performance in one game. I don't mean that as an extension of the age-old 'What is the most important criteria for MVP' ~~battle royale~~ ~~argument~~ debate (well, I guess I do as I'm giving my opinion on, touching on the matter, on a basketball forum, so I'm asking for it aren't I...), but rather that it's simply not an *objectively* or *exclusively* statistical award. It's not the scoring leader. It's not the NBA equivalent of the Premier League Golden Glove award for the keeper with the most clean sheets. Of course, the stats matter, but regardless of **which** stats one places the most value on (now *that* touches on the 'what is the MVP' debate), it's as much about how we respond and react to those stats as it is about the stats themselves. And that response is wholly to do with watching the player's play, and is wholly to do with the individual performances in any one given game. We remember Harden digging Wesley Johnson a grave while reading the paper, and that'll forever be a defining image of his MVP-season. But it's just one 3-pointer, in the first-quarter no less. We remember 'Blocked by James!' as *the image* of the Cavs ending the Cleveland drought and of LeBron getting Finals MVP. But it was just 1 block in a 7 game series. Except both of these moments and countless more come to symbolise so much more than just those stats in just those games. A system like this would instead restrict them to only those stats in only those games."
"1) LeBron James, leaves a back to back 60+ win team in his prime, to play with the 2nd best player and another top 10-15 player, both in their primes.   ""it's fine because he didn't join a Championship caliber team that he lost to""  2) Ray Allen, leaves a team to join he loses a 3-2 lead to in the Conference Finals that goes onto win the Championship after scoring 14.2 and having the best 3 point shooting year of his career and a top 10 TS%  ""it's fine because he was past his prime""  In conclusion: ""FUCK KD SNEK ASS BITCH"" "
"I'm gonna try to say this as slowly and simply as possible. If the 2010 Dallas Mavericks had gone on to win 7 rings not a single damn person would be sitting here complaining. We'd all be slow clapping.  The difference is that when the best player of the league spends 9 years dragging dead weight to the NBA finals only to be beaten by Boston Celtics super teams and Lakers superteams and so he joins two middle tier allstars on a lottery team and literally half of NBA fans spend the next ten years shitting on him for it.   But when a team with 3 all stars, the back to back MVP, a championship, the record best NBA season of all time then ads the previous MVP who came from a team with multiple MVP's and multiple trips to the finals just almost beat them 3-1 in the playoffs AND the best center in the league somehow you're all still sitting here being whiny dumbass band wagon bitches about Lebron James.   Grow a spine. "

Lebron James is a Russian spy confirmed. 
"Pretty dumb? LeBron James is NOT Ray Allen, the skill level of these players and age is what you're not getting. Such a simple concept but u don't understand. It's a completely different situation when it's a top 2 player IN HIS PRIME."
"If you define ""playmaking"" as ""scoring off the dribble and **passing**"" and remember that the original comparison was to **Steph Curry and Lebron James**, then it's actually very easy to say that Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and (especially) Anthony Davis are deficient by comparison."
And LeBron James is losing to the Warriors because of the trickledown effects of his own moves. So?
"&gt;So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.   You have an opinion bro. No one is stopping you from that. Other people who have watched both in their prime have said LeBron is better. Some prefer LeBron, some prefer Kobe. You’re just dickriding Kobe hard."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"&gt; Replace this statement with any superstar.  You can't seem to make your mind up, the whole point of your bullshit is that he doesn't make his teammates better, but now you're saying he does to the extent that any superstar does?    &gt; name something he elevated for any player.  For one, that is spoken exactly like someone who is just making an argument centered around shooting percentages with a basketball reference tab in the background. I'll name something he elevates for players - win totals.  Both Melo and PG left a weaker conference, and still won more games this year than on their previous teams.   &gt; have opportunities to score and force an assist instead  When? In the last game of the season vs Memphis? When he's trying to get teammates going because he's bricking? I think it's a pretty hard sell to try to assert that Westbrook purposefully gives up buckets at the detriment of his team. For one, because he is *always* trying to do whatever it takes to win, and for two, year before last he won the fucking scoring title (31.6 ppg)!  &gt; literally the same  In the comment before this one, the point you were making was that after KD left, Roberson's shooting percentages and other stats had not increased. KD leaving is not LeBron arriving, Roberson is not Bosh, and the 2017 Thunder are not the Heatles. I can't think of a shittier extended comparison that someone has honestly tried to make to me in my life. Are you saying Mario Chalmers made LeBron James and Chris Bosh better basketball players?  &gt; Oladipo [...] got better after he left  Oladipo's numbers got better after he left because he was handed a franchise, along with a personal drive that got ignited in him when he left which resulted in an enormous amount of work being put in on his part. To attribute his season to being away from Russ is reductive to the extreme and not fair at all to Vic.    &gt; parroted BS that gets repeated here  [Weird to say for someone who is just parroting an article from the Ringer.](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/12/13/16770062/victor-oladipo-russell-westbrook-okc-effect)  &gt; His energy inspires, sure.  &gt; For some people it may make them work harder.  I'm not saying that Westbrook is magical. No one is. I'm just saying the same thing you're admitting left and right here. There will always be variables that fuck with a statistic when it comes to sports. You can't make assumptions as if these are experimental conditions, with stats revealing concrete truths about interactions between players' games. Who knows what these players' stats might look like in a vacuum? But we can clearly see that Westbrook drives other players to try to match his energy and intensity, echoed by the words of his teammates, present and past. If you don't consider that beneficial, then I don't think we're going to change each others' minds, man."

LEBRON JAMES
LeBron James
"I'll jump in. First, I think KD is the best player who has come into the league since LeBron and it's not particularly close. If KD retired today - I would likely have him as high as #9 on the all-time list for players who came into the league 1979 or later.   But, as far as why I don't think it's a competition between him and Kobe:  1. Durant was a passable or slightly above-average defender through most of his career. He started to turn it on and focus more on that end in 2016, but even then, he has never been a lock-down one-on-one defender. Kobe was a top-3 perimeter defender in the league for a solid decade and he would always take the toughest perimeter assignment in playoff match-ups, while still playing 40-plus minutes per game and expending a ton of energy on offense. Which brings me to...  2. Kobe's conditioning was insane. He was relentless and put more pressure on teams offensively and defensively, from start-to-finish, than basically anyone in the league. The only other player post-Jordan who committed that kind of maniacal intensity to both sides of the floor from start to finish was KG. KD, for as amazing as he is, has a tendency to float through games for large stretches. Sometimes you even forget he's on the court for quarters at a time - that was never the case with Kobe.  3. KD is an extremely versatile scorer. His three point shooting is much better than Kobe's ever was. While KD is hyper-efficient, he's not secretive about caring about his efficiency and advanced stats and playing to that, which just was not what people cared about or paid attention to during Kobe's day. When things got tight in the playoffs and KD had to go to higher volume than he preferred, his efficiency dropped pretty dramatically. 43% in the 2016 playoffs, 46% in 2014, 45.5% in 2013. He did shoot an insane 52% during the 2012 run. I don't think it's fair to look at KD's efficiency these past two seasons, since he got extremely easy shots since he plays with Steph and Klay. And while it may be fair to say Kobe had Shaq, they never had great three point shooting and Shaq clogged the lane, so there just wasn't the space like there is in the NBA. When you look at Kobe's best playoff years - they're actually more efficient than most of KD's years in OKC. In one-on-one situations, Kobe just has an arsenal of moves that KD lacks, although you can argue it's easier for KD to get off his shot since he's 7-foot, so he doesn't need to build that arsenal. In any event - if you conclude KD is a slightly better scorer than Kobe, that's basically the only aspect of his game that is better.  4. Playmaking - Kobe was a much better passer than KD, even if reluctant to do so at times. Kobe averaged 5 assists or more in the playoffs seven times in an offense that suppresses individual assist-totals. KD has averaged more than 5 assists in the playoffs once in his career.   5. It sounds corny saying ""mental-edge,"" but that's part of the game. Kobe would have the psychological edge over most of his opponents. Sometimes that translated to winning and sometimes it did not. But KD certainly just doesn't have this.  Just a reminder - that we're splitting hairs here. There are two of the best players of all-time. Just because I think that Kobe was a better basketball player doesn't take away anything from KD. I think James Harden is an amazing bball player, but he still doesn't touch KD."
"The internal conflict Kobe stans feel on a daily basis now that Lebron is a Laker is hilarious to me    This guy is an excellent example. 3 days ago he said “Sorry that players thrived playing with MJ, but their numbers seem to go down with LeBron”    And just one day ago he said “The fact that LeBron James is on the Los Angeles Lakers still hasn't hit me yet. The greatest player of this generation and arguably the greatest player of all-time is playing for us” "

LeBron James
There's a good breakdown on LeBron's feet here  https://www.thegaitguys.com/thedailyblog/lebron-james-and-his-funky-toes-we-have-the-scoop
&gt; The media needs to start being fined for tampering  Bruh what are they supposed to do? report why LeBron james wouldn't join their team when he's FA? and there's a reason why big market teams have a pull on FA because of the exposure they get on top of their salary.   You ain't gonna convince anyone that LeBron wouldve been interested to join the Grizzlies 
He was described as the heir to Jordan *then*: https://www.si.com/vault/2002/02/18/318739/ahead-of-his-class-ohio-high-school-junior-lebron-james-is-so-good-that-hes-already-being-mentioned-as-the-heir-to-air-jordan
"""Remember when we got to see LeBron James vs Kevin Durant in back to back finals as well as four times every regular season"".  Anyone old enough to remember feeling deprived of an LBJvKobe final should get this.  To be honest most of the shit people complain about rn they'll probably miss. "
"For a dude who's team hasn't had the success of a team like the Lakers, losing a guy for the second time, that anyone who's a fan of their team could have mixed feelings over LeBron James joining their team is just like lunacy. "
"??? I mean I know shaq was a beast but are you saying AD, KAT, boogie, shit even Lebron James all don’t even qualify as legit post players? Besides isn’t the argument usually that the W’s guards would get stifled by all the physicality that was allowed back then? But somehow our frontcourt wouldn’t be allowed to take advantage of that same physicality? "
Over/Under on the percent of the telecast that will be devoted to LeBron James discussion? I'd be shocked if it's not on the over side of 50. 
He actually said that today. [link](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24113118/lavar-ball-boasts-beat-lebron-james-one-one-says-back-my-heyday-hold-me)

"We talking Horford signing with the 48 win Celtics that lost in round one, or Hayward signing with the 53 win Celtics that lost by 50 to LeBron James?  You're right, they're totally the same thing. What was I thinking"
yes lebron james does that

"There were pictures that showed one hand looking swollen compared to the other, that existed before that story came out. At least there’s evidence to support it as opposed to the elbow, iirc.  Edit: https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/06/11/lebron-james-hand-injury-photographic-investigation/"
But Yao Ming had foot / ankle issues his whole career. While Lebron James looks to be entering his prime in his 15th year in the league...

“LeBron James with no regard for human life! Has just given the cavaliers their largest lead of the game!” 
"&gt;Lebron did that chased down block on Andre before Irvings three.  Wtf. That's what I said.  &gt;He did the chase down block then he missed the layup.   Who missed a layup? Kyrie missed a floater, Lebron chasedown block, Kyrie 3, Lebron free throws.  &gt;Comparing 2011 Mavs title to Cavs 2016 just shows everyone how deluded lebron james fan  How? Lebron was the only all-star on the Cavs Kyrie and Love were not all-stars. Yes Kyrie made clutch shots but so did Jason Terry for Dirk. You are just showing how biased you are.  "
"Gary Harris is just a older less promising Josh Hart  We're only paying 10 million more per year for LeBron James than you are for Jokic.  I can understand the saltyness, I would be too if you were trying to compete against a team you have no hopes of competeing against.   We had prime Kobe, what, 5 years ago?  Now we have Prime LeBron..   I can understand your frustrations."
"Celtics would abuse them. Brad Stevens the mastermind has 3 intelligent experienced superstars which allows him to run more complex schemes to discombobulate every laker besides James. He can exploit the youngsters weaknesses in ways that I just don’t think the Lakers have enough experience to adjust to yet. Lebron’s patience is going to be tested. I can see him getting frustrated early in games and deciding to take over, and the Lakers aren’t built to succeed if Lebron decides to play like he did in Cleveland. People are making it as simple as Lebron beat them twice in Cleveland and now has a better supporting cast but the Lakers won’t be as good as Cleveland was their first year, despite having more talent. The Lakers are building a team with a play style that has a higher ceiling than Lebron carrying but it’s a process to reach that ceiling."
Wtf are you talking about?  The warriors were **overwhelmingly** the favorites in Vegas.  The betting odds had GSW with a 2/3 chance of winning.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/06/02/betting-odds-2016-nba-finals-warriors-cavaliers-stephen-curry-lebron-james/85312676/
wrong. Lebron did that chased down block on Andre before Irvings three. He did the chase down block then he missed the layup. Comparing 2011 Mavs title to Cavs 2016 just shows everyone how deluded lebron james fan are plus you are now probably lakers fan
"The Cavs won the chip in 2016 with 1 All Star, LeBron James."
"One time I saw LeBron James wearing Lakers shorts and flip flops, so I bought Lakers shorts and flip flops"
"Because his name is a large part of his marketability - the brand is LeBron James. That's a silly comparison. Gatora is loving your post though! Look at all the people talking about them. I'm going to go get an Orange 2 for $3 right now, thanks. Wonder if that has something to do with them agreeing to give the NBA tons of money in exchange for slightly altering the name of one of their products."
But the dleague was trash before gatorade...LeBron been amazing since the womb.  If LeBron was smush Parker before Nike found him I'd be totally fine with him changing his name to LeNike James.
LeBron has a Nike contract. They're sponsoring him. That doesn't mean he should change his name to Nike James. You can improve things without disrupting an obvious convention. 
"I mean you did have 6 players averaging more than 10 points that series. Only lebron james and love averaged more than 10 points for the cavs and kevin love(all star) only averaged 12 points with under 40% shooting including 26% from the 3 point line oh and also george hill the point guard averaged less than 2 assists....The lakers roster is completely different to the cavs roster because in every possible shape and form its better. Lakers would've been a playoff team if they shot better from the FT line they woulda won enough games to be in the playoffs, in the westeren conference. Cavs wouldn't even be a playoff team in the eastern conference without Lebron. Think about that "

"LOL he scored 50 on the Warriors, he in no way shape or form would make them worse. I understand ""fit"" but it's lebron james, don't think for one second that KD is better than him. Please don't be a prisoner of the moment"
"Because people want Lebron to win and have the best team possible. Lebron can join Kd and James Harden and people wouldn't say dumb stuff like ""oh his rings don't count"" I have never heard the awful narrative of a star's championship outweighing others in value until Lebron started losing frequently in the finals.   The Jedi mind tricks his fans play are laughable. In reality he's 3-6 but Lebron fans math goes 6-3 because his Cavs win equals three in value and his loses to The Warriors don't count because they had a better team and Kyrie was hurt one year. It's pathetic the lengths his fans go in order to validate his greatness"
Me: “Sir we’ve been robbed..”  Manager: “Did you chase?”  Me: “Nah”  Manger: “Picture?”  Me: “Yeah and Autograph”  Me: “ We were robbed by Lebron James”
"Well I'm not talking about Kyle Korver and Jeff Teague, I'm talking about Lebron fucking James and Dwyane Wade.  The Heat won 47 games in 2009-2010 with Wade as the only all-star. If Chris Bosh had already been there Lebron would have been joining a 60-something win team. It's not like he took some rag-tag team and transformed them into a contender, they created a completely new team. Comparing the pre-Lebron Heat to the pre-KD Warriors is a stupid argument.  It wouldn't have been surprising if the Heat won 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. in a row either. Everybody expected them to dominate the 2010s. They didn't, because dominating is hard. The Warriors learned that in 2016 and again in the WCF this year."
"You do know MVP doesn’t make you the best player in the league. James Harden is most definitely not the best in the league. If it were about being the best, LeBron would be winning years on end."
"Oh, come off it. People are making fun of it because it's an actual neckbeard. Not even LeBron James can make a neckbeard cool. "
"Are you saying that the Warriors indirectly assisted in Lebron James losing to the Mavs?  Man, this rivalry has broken through space-time."
"Yes, you are literally the living proof that it’s overrated.   So you are telling me an injured Curry and Andre, without Bogut could be a 73 win team?   Jesus Christ.   Lebron James beat an injured, crumbled team. Stop overrating it. "
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Well if you played the LeBron James system, LBJ would keep his stats or elevate them while MJ's would go down, especially his assists. If you played any other system, both of them would go down or up accordingly to usage rates."
"That's correct. Less FG attempts, less points obviously. But how does LeBron make Kevin Love better? Or Chris Bosh? He doesn't. He doesn't make any star player better (Wade, Bosh, Kyrie, Love). My argument was incorrect: LeBron makes role players better but that's it. His system revolves around him and only him. Meaning every other player on the court gotta adjust. KLove brings multiple facets to the game and on offense, while playing the LBJ system, only his 3 pt shooting is valuable. The same goes for Chris Bosh. The LeBron system is great for carrying and over performing with subpar talent (2007;2018) but it caps LeBron's star teammates output. And while it maximizes LeBron James' talent, it doesn't lead to as many championships as you'd think because it doesn't bring out the best of his best team mates"
A) Go play for your hometown Lakers with Lebron James and their young core in beautiful Los Angeles. B) Go play in a very cold city you have no affiliation with alongside a average roster. 
That's what I thought it said:   Is Lebron James j.r. The next J.R. Smith?
What's wrong with that?  It's Lebron James fucking dunking.
How do I get into Lebron James' inner wine tasting circle now that he's in LA. 
"*Police show up after call*  ""Can you tell us what he looked like?""  **""Um yeah, it was LeBron James.**  ""Sir I'm gonna need you to blow into this."""
"Since when is playing for a team for 15 years not ""committed long term""?   Can someone please tell me why the fuck you're all so damn salty about Lebron James?  Kevin Love is great. But why the fuck do you have to turn a complement to Kevin Love into a jab at Lebron for fucks sake? Kevin Love was never going to be the Lebron. He's not as good of a Lebron as Lebron. Kevin Love isn't an idiot and he knows that to create a good championship team you have to let the best player dominate. But for some reason you have to shit on Lebron for being good and asking another good player to take a slightly smaller role.   It's stupid. "
How the fuck would anyone know the texts between Lebron and KD?  &gt;The news about LeBron calling Kyrie soft after Kyrie suffered an injury in the 2015 playoffs? Fake  &gt;The news that Kyrie didn't want LeBron to come to Cleveland that came from the same report as the one about LeBron calling Kyrie soft? That is totally and absolutely true. No need to confirm with any other sources.  These are true. Lebron makes fun of Kyrie being injured right [here](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/lebron-james-kyrie-irving-celebration) 
"http://www.espn.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/news/story?id=6274778  &gt; This season's MVP debate is settled as far as LeBron James is concerned.  &gt; James said he believes Derrick Rose is rightfully the front-runner for the league's top individual award and that everyone else falls in line behind the Chicago Bulls point guard.  &gt; ""I think [it's] Derrick Rose,"" James said before the Heat's game Wednesday night against the Washington Wizards. ""What he's done for that team, with all the injuries they have and them being first in the Eastern Conference -- they're playing some really good basketball."""
"Who cares man? Seriously.   Magic has called Kobe a greater Laker than him and many still dispute it and rightfully so.   Don't try and act as if the player's word is definitive.   Edit:   This is what LeBron said by the way  &gt; ""Right now, statistically, it's probably one of the best years I've had,"" James said. ""But we'll see. The media kind of controls it. You've got some guys here that have done their job also. At one point, I thought Dirk was also [worthy] until he got hurt. But Derrick Rose definitely has gotten a lot of the exposure and a lot of the media attention because of the work he's done. He's playing some unbelievable basketball."""

Lebron James.
Tim Duncan. It goes beyond just longevity. He put up one of  the single greatest rookie campaigns ever. The guy put up 20+ ppg 12 rebounds and 2.5 blocks. He pulled 22 rebounds in his second road game against Rodman.   He won a championship within his second year and had already become the best player on his team next to the likes of David Robinson. His continued success and consistent output of quality season after season is extremely significant as he essentially made the Spurs a playoff fixture in the extremely competitive western conference. In addition to his many championships was the fact that he achieved all of this in the era of Shaq and Kobe - one of the most dominant 1-2 punch duos the league has ever seen. Beating that team essentially meant winning the chip altogether. He helped defeat a young Lebron James led Cavs squad (probably the least impressive chip to be honest) and then was instrumental in beating an even better Lebron James and an exponentially better cast than the lads time they faced off.  TD is the real deal and is the greatest power forward of his generation and quite frankly in my mind the greatest power forward in the history of the NBA.
"Isn’t Lebron on record saying he wants to be the first Lebron James, not the next Michael Jordan? Wouldn’t it be safe to assume that Michael Jordan recognizes that fact and stays out of Lebron’s limelight? Why does there always have to be animosity?"
"The thing that really ignited my passion in the NBA being from the UK was [this article about the 50 greatest moments of Michael Jordan's Career](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1524098-celebrating-michael-jordans-50th-birthday-with-his-top-50-career-moments#slide1) and going through and watching all the career top-10s on the [NBA youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhyANGHDDH8&amp;list=PLlVlyGVtvuVmZEMZBPdM61wry1SV040h7)  The NBA Finals mini-movies on the channel are also really great if you can find them, and the [top viewed videos of all time are good to go through as well](https://www.youtube.com/user/NBA/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid)  From there I kind of just read little bits here and there where I could, and I watched the Starters show on the NBA channel as well, as it was an easy introduction into following the league, and getting to know some of the players.  As far as picking a team is concerned, I've always felt that when you have a real passion in a new sport, you don't always choose a team, so much as a team chooses you, as corny as that sounds.  For me it was watching the all-star game in 2015, and seeing Russell Westbrook of OKC stand out, and that led to me watching the team, and getting invested in his performances, and then the team as a whole.  For most newbies who don't have a local team it's almost always their first favourite player that grips them and makes them a fan. So really, the best is to watch whatever games you can, find out what kind of basketball you like to watch, and who you like to watch and go from there.  Some big players right now to try to catch would be LeBron of course, Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Milwaukee, Steph Curry of Golden State, James Harden of the Rockets, Anthony Davis of the Pelicans, and Joel Embiid of Philadelphia.  When the season starts up again in October there'll be plenty of streams available to watch, and of course national TV too (I'm assuming you're in America)  Also playing NBA 2K is a really engaging way of getting into everything. Another common way for people to become a fan of a team is that they were drafted by or played for a franchise in MyCareer mode on 2K.  There's a number of beginners guides too if you google for them"
"&gt; Setting up teammates for some easy, open high percentage shots will contribute to more wins.  He does this all the time, every single game. He led the NBA in assists last year, and has been top 4 for four straight seasons. He's one of the best passers in the league; he constantly creates wide open 3's off the drive and kick, and he's deadly in the pnr.  Outside of LeBron James, there is no other player in this generation that can create as many shots for himself and others as Russell Westbrook."

"You might. I just don't think that recollection is there for the reasons I stated. The same would be true for the Cleveland team if you replaced Lebron with like James Harden or something.  I think Lebron is the only difference, as I stated, in this comparison. Jim Kelly isn't the football equivalent to Lebron James and that is why more people would have remembered a 0-4 cavs team."
"That analogy only works for actual Kobe and Lebron, not their fans.  It's more like you admire the most popular kid in school, and some other guy comes in and is even cooler. But you shit on everyone who likes the new guy because you liked the older guy. But in reality neither of the cool guys was ever friends with you, nor did they know you existed.  It's sad. The actual Kobe Bryant probably wouldn't give a fan of his the time of day if they ever crossed paths in public. Lebron James wouldn't either. They would both be surrounded by bodyguards and security moving fans away.  But here they are defacing murals out of some sad loyalty to somebody who they'll never meet or know."
"Are you serious right now? I literally picked out an entire decade of basketball from Melo, which included some down years, and compared it to  Wiggins' BEST season, one in which Butler wasn't on the team. If you look at Melo's WORST season from his rookie year all the way up to 2017, it was still better than Wiggins' best year.   If you want to be fair, compare their per100 numbers at the same ages. That would account for Wiggins' getting fewer possessions because he took a backseat.   For the first four years of their career:   Melo:  33.6 Pts, 7.9 Reb, 4.1 Ast, .539 TS%, .120 WS/48   Wiggins: 27.5 Pts, 5.8 Reb, 2.9 Ast, .526 TS%, .050 WS/48  And Melo was doing that as the only good scoring option on his team and the main focus of the defense, whereas Wiggins has never been the main scorer and didn't receive the defense's full gameplanning and attention. Melo was already a 2x All-NBA player in his first four seasons, and led his team to the playoffs every single year. This is a guy who almost won Rookie of the Year over LeBron fucking James."

After putting up huge statlines, all triple doubles in the first few games but somehow averaging 27/7/7, Drake spearheads an investigation along with other raptors fans concluding that DeBron James was LeBron James all along. Cornering DeBron James, they reveal that they know his true identity. DeBron James pulls off a prosthetic mask and reveals his true identity: OG Anunoby, who ends his second season with a narrow ROY win over Ben Simmons."

"No, you are just happy Lebron James is on the Lakers lol. "
the restriction is in the number of years. his final contract was 2 years.  https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-cba-changed-over-36-rule-lebron-james-200-million-contract-2016-12
"LOL ""Lebron James is a 15 WAR player"" - that's literally you right now dude.  Chill out - LeBron + Trash couldn't do it last year, I'm not sure why you think he can do it this year. I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone that believes he's worth 15 wins haha.  Lemme be realistic for, cuz your homer opinion is blinding the fuck out of you:  1. GSW 2. HOU 3. OKC 4. SAS 5. UTA 6. PORT/DEN 7. PORT/DEN 8. Twolves 9. Maybe u fucks?"
"Ya I mean we rested players against you guys when our team was already missing its superstar?  None of that matters, you look dumb when we all remember that your team was a 35 win team last season and you added Lebron James and then a group of troll-ass garbage players. How many more wins do you expect this season? We may have lost to you guys 4 times, but we beat far better teams many more times than that and were in fact a far better team (or at least the W-L would say so).  Ya'll sucked last year and you will suck this year, why can't Lakers fans ever just accept that ""No, we aren't going to get any more superstars, and we might just have to swallow a few bad years of bball."""
"He'll pass the reigns of the league to a just-in-his prime LeBron James, who has finally taken his talents to The Alamo to play for Gregg Popovich, who has just won his eighth ring as an NBA head coach."
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Carmelo Anthony  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Sweet Melon in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Melos game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Sweet Melon, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched MELO in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Sweet Melon is better.  You might be jealous of Melos zero rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Knicks fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Melo isn't even a top 100 player ever. So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Sweet Melon talk to the adults. Fair?"
"Pre-Achilles tear he was pretty bad. The Pelicans defense took off once he got hurt and AD started playing center with Mirotic at PF.  And it's not just about being ""not that bad on defense.""

"When [Kawhi Leonard](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/sports/basketball/kawhi-leonard-PESPT000010540-topic.html) started playing golf, he was fitted with specially lengthened clubs and extra, extra large grips so his catcher-mitt hands, which measure 9¾ inches from wrist to tip and 11¼ inches from thumb to pinky, wouldn’t swallow the handle.  The point being: There’s nothing standard, off-the-rack about him.  The other point being: It might not be good news for the Lakers.  Leonard was traded from San Antonio to Toronto on Wednesday, part of a blockbuster swap that also involved All-Star guard [DeMar DeRozan](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/sports/basketball/demar-derozan-PESPT0000010718-topic.html), No. 9 overall pick Jakob Poeltl and a 2019 first-round pick heading south and [Danny Green](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/sports/basketball/danny-green-PESPT0000010762-topic.html), a veteran guard who has won both NCAA and [NBA](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/sports/basketball/nba-15008001-topic.html) titles, going north.  Leonard coerced the trade with his impending status as an unrestricted free agent after the 2018-19 season but he couldn’t coerce the destination, as much as his camp hinted that, you know, a return to Southern California would be nice.  Instead … Toronto?  It sounds like Siberia for a kid from Moreno Valley and San Diego State, the NBA’s lone franchise north of the border, a team named after a dinosaur, a city with an average *high*temperature of 31 degrees in January and average winter snowfall of 47.8 inches, a country with higher taxes.  So Leonard will zip up his parka, play an obligatory season with the [Raptors](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/sports/basketball/toronto-raptors-ORSPT000118-topic.html), respectfully decline their offer for a lucrative long-term contract and bid adieu to the Great White North next summer … just as the Lakers, who conspicuously have been signing free agents to one-year contracts, clear salary cap space for him to join [LeBron James](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/sports/basketball/lebron-james-PESPT008359-topic.html).  Right?  That’s the off-the-rack take.  Here’s what someone who knows Leonard as well as anybody told me privately: “He’s going to fall in love with Toronto – it’s going to happen. He’s not going to leave, I’m telling you.”  Raptors might become rapture.  For seven years, until things went sideways over the diagnosis (or misdiagnosis) of quadriceps tendinopathy that cost him all but nine games last season, San Antonio seemed like the perfect place for a quiet, unassuming guy who doesn’t covet money or fame or individual accolades, just titles. The coach, [Gregg Popovich](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/sports/basketball/gregg-popovich-PESPT000009508-topic.html), is creative and innovative. The city, low key. The fan base, passionate. The locker room, chill – refreshingly devoid of egos bloated by making $20 million to put a round ball in a round hoop. And the team was a perennial title contender.  Toronto?  It has a young, creative, innovative coach in Nick Nurse; a fan base that is loyal and passionate but will leave you alone in public; a cosmopolitan city that many rank the best stop in the NBA; a locker room full of versatile, defensive-oriented players who don’t care about scoring averages; a progressive front office that, unlike many franchises, helps players secure local marketing deals; a loaded roster that won 59 games last season and no longer has to worry about its nemesis, LeBron, in the Eastern Conference playoffs; and Green, one of Leonard’s closest teammates from the [Spurs](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/sports/basketball/san-antonio-spurs-ORSPT000116-topic.html).  The club president is Nigerian-born Masai Ujiri, the only non-American to be named NBA executive of the year. Leonard has called meeting [Barack Obama](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/topic/politics-government/government/barack-obama-PEPLT007408-topic.html) during the Spurs’ visit to the White House following their 2014 championship “one of my greatest experiences.” Ujiri is tight with Obama and spent last week with him in Kenya opening a basketball court by Ujiri’s Giants of Africa charity.  Leonard likes listening to rapper Drake. Toronto is Drake’s hometown. He’s courtside for most games.  “We welcome you,” Drake wrote in an open letter to Leonard posted on social media, “to the most intense and supportive city in NBA basketball!!! You have always been a poised clinical warrior, and I can’t wait to see how Toronto inspires your fight.”  Or listen to Sharon Powell.  She’s the mother of Norman Powell, the Lincoln High alum who played at UCLA and was initially drafted by Milwaukee, only to be quickly dealt farther east to Toronto. A Southern California boy shipped to the Great White North.  He’s been there three seasons and last fall signed a four-year extension. Sharon, who lives in San Diego, likes it so much that she vows to attend every home game this season.  “The first time I went, it was freezing cold – cold like you just don’t know,” Sharon says. “But it was the best, it was amazing … Norman loves it there, he really does. He likes the city, the people, the team. The fans are so great, so supportive. They’re humble, they’re nice, they’re cordial. I haven’t seen pushy people yet.  “It’s just a fabulous place. Everybody has treated us with open arms. I’m hoping when Kawhi gets there he’ll feel the same way. I know he’ll be treated the same way.”  It’s a message she will share with Kim Robertson, Leonard’s mother whom she has befriended through basketball circles.  Ujiri will be telling her, too. The future of his franchise might depend on it.  “There’s something about this city, about this place, this team, that a star player hasn’t figured out yet,” Ujiri told the Toronto Star last year. “There will be a first one … it’s going to happen, for sure. Maybe not in my time, maybe 20 years from now, maybe 10 years from now, maybe five years from now.  “But I’m telling you, somebody’s going to figure it out. We haven’t won big, but people can see that and say: ‘How cool is that there? What if I came there? Maybe I can make it cooler. Maybe I can build it bigger.’”  Leonard isn’t saying if it will be him. He isn’t saying much of anything, as usual. He was in Toronto on Friday to finalize trade details, and the team hosted a news conference. With Ujiri, not Leonard.  But to prove the 2014 NBA Finals MVP and two-time defensive player of the year was indeed in town and diffuse speculation that he might refuse to report, the Raptors tweeted a picture of Leonard, Ujiri and general manager Bobby Webster.  Leonard is famously stoic in photos, to the point where teammates kid him about it. But look closely at the man standing between Ujiri and Webster, and you can see the corners of his mouth slightly upturned. You can see some teeth.  You can see – yes, there it is – the beginnings of a smile."
"Why not? Spurs have the greatest coach of all time, a solid roster and two all stars? Ok, Lakers have Lebron James and a decent team aroud him, but Spurs are surely better if the Lakers don't make some major signings."
"I believe Kawhi is going to stay with the Raptors. But I also believe that it’s going to take LeBron James, another star, for Brandon Ingram to play like a star, keeping Lonzo, Kuz, and for Hart, Svi and Moe to be real contributors if we are going to be contenders.

I see your point and even though there's no evidence he's had any kind of affair there's also no evidence that he hasn't. But as you said, it's crazy to think that its the worst thing he has been rumored to do compared to some other players, like Kobe who's being idolized basically everywhere. "
I feel like most of these awards are based on storylines anyway and have a lot to do with media coverage.   MVP Lebron James. They’re not going to not give Lebron James an award for his first year in LA. Lebron always gets media attention but it’s going to be multiplied by 1000 now.   COTY Brad Stevens. Should’ve won last year probably and the fact that he’s teams getting better with everyone coming back from injuries he’s a lock for his award too.

Show some respect kid  &gt;   Lakers will be in the 3rd to 4th seed range, won't even shock me if they got the 2nd seed.

And Wiggin's comp coming out of high school was Lebron James. Comparisons can be wrong. Harden with defense is like a top 15 player ever. 
"First you definitively state that you *know* what the Spurs were *not demanding*.  Right up next is conjecture - ""most likely"".  So basically you don't have the slightest clue (none of us really do), but insist on going down with your own version of events. Okay.  There's also a logical fallacy in your line of argument. Whilst I do agree that no player on our present roster with the exception of LeBron James should be seen as indispensable, it's foolishness to assume that you agree to include *any* combination of them in a trade for Kawhi Leonard.  The kind of flippant disregard for your own assets in a he'll bent pursuit of a superstar caliber player is the type of shit you see the worst execs this decade get fired for.   Look around you and see what the blueprint of success in the modern NBA is.

"We have Lebron James, try again sweetie.  . . . (I’m joking btw, I know what you meme)"
I guess that's a fair point. But LeBron James would've been a good tight end if he continued playing football. 
Yup and LeBron James is still the first thing I see when I open up r/nba on mobile. Lesigh 
"I listed their stats from the last 3 years. They are correct. Pay attention to what's relevant in the discussion.   &gt; Lowry is the second offensive option. Opposing defenses worry about derozan first then Lowry. Those other guys don’t have that luxury.  But muh gravity! Lol. Kyrie wasn't the second option to Lebron James (generational playmaker and demands way more attention than DeRozan) in 2016 and 17 while shooting a worse percentage from 3 on less attempts? I could've sworn he was. Lmao  &gt; Lowry may be more versatile but reddick three point shot in general is much deadlier so even if he can’t do it in as many ways he stills a better shooter so I give it to him.  Again that's fine. This is the closest comparison by far out of all the names you mentioned.  &gt; Lillard, Kyrie and Harden don't have much of an argument. Neither does Kawhi.   Yeah....their 3 point shooting stats are worse over the past 3 years. Kyrie less attempts, worse percentage, plays with as a second option to LeBron James, because apparently that matters so much to you, well it makes Kyrie looks even worse here lol. Harden shot 4% worse over those 3 years. That isn't worth the 1.6 more 3PA. Lillard has an even worse argument. 3% less efficient on only 0.6 more 3PA. And what argument does Kawhi have when you can't even use a 3 year sample size to compare the two? He was injured last year and didn't shoot the 3 well in 2014-15. Even if you only use 2016 and 2017, the volume isn't even close. He peaked at 5.2 3PA. They're not in the same realm behind the arc.    "
"Here is the gm survey result in 2012 after Rose won MVP  If you were starting a franchise and could sign any player, who would it be?  1. Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City -- 37.0%  2.

Yeah we're really sad that we only got LeBron James.   
Make no mistake - the Lakers are basically doing exactly what they did with Paul George. They lost on that transaction and they risk losing here too (on a far superior player). Leonard is easily a top 5 player and would constitute the best player James has ever played beside. It was a huge gamble to not trade for him. And everyone else (except obviously LeBron) on the Lakers’s roster is replaceable right now.
"&gt; Even that article is just a bunch of “I love Kobe” quotes with a few sprinkles of “I didn’t like LeBron in Miami or Cleveland because x or y” most of which is qualified with “but my mind will probably change once he’s a Laker”  I feel your overall point, but that's really not what the article says. The actual quotes were  &gt; Andrews grimaced. &gt; “I’m not a fan of LeBron,” he said.  &gt; many more sounded confused and annoyed... &gt; “I don’t even know where to start,” said Stephanie... “He’s such a diva sometimes.”  &gt; Jeremy Gonzales, a 20-year-old student from Long Beach, Calif., rattled through a list of criticisms, including his allegation that James is a lazy defender. (James has been named to the league’s all-defensive team six times.)  &gt; “I also didn’t like that he didn’t want to shoot,” Gonzales said. “And now that he shoots, I still don’t like that he doesn’t have a post game.” &gt; They do not love James. Not yet, anyway.  &gt; “I never liked him,” said Yumul...  “I always thought he seemed really cocky.”  &gt; “But I’m not excited about it,” she said.  &gt; “And dramatic,” Dawana said.  &gt;  She questioned his loyalty.  &gt; “Don’t get me wrong: He’s good,” she said as she pondered the seasons ahead. “Maybe I’ll feel differently once he wins a championship for the Lakers.”  The article shows a mix. Some are just finding it a bit uncomfortable because they've rooted against lebron for 15 years, so it's a weird transition to rooting *for* hi. But others think he's a diva, overrated, choker, etc. Charactarizing the article as saying that '“I didn’t like LeBron in Miami or Cleveland because x or y” most of which is qualified with “but my mind will probably change once he’s a Laker”' just isn't right, straight up.   And that last quote is particularly salient (and it's one that you were probably referencing). It wasn't just saying that they'll change their mind once he's playing for them, it's ""once he wins a championship"". That may well just not happen. Nobody doubts that the last of the haters will come around if Lebron wins a title, winning a title cures all wounds. But given the reality that the Lakers aren't title favorites, that's a crucial distinction.  There are a wide range of feelings on the issue. But again I wouldn't assume that the Lakers fans you talk to are representative of the whole city. You can check Facebook comments to get another such slice, where you'll see guys excoriating Lebron and saying that he's just trying to rip off Kobe's legacy. Again, one very likely reason is that serious Laker fans *are* the ones excited, because no shit Lebron is on their team! But there are huge swathes of people who aren't as engaged with the team, grew up idolizing Kobe, probably followed basketball a little less the last few years when the Lakers were rebuilding, and are going to still keep on disliking Lebron until he wins it all (which he may never do).  This just isn't a subtle phenomenon. You don't have to look far to find it. And I think it's important that people understand that the people they know and talk to might not represent the whole fanbase. Boston fans take a lot of shit for various things, often justifiably. If I told you ""Uh, none of the people I know do that"", you wouldn't think that was a definitive stance on the issue."

"[Here's one sample writeup](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/sports/lakers-lebron-james-kobe-bryant.html) by the NYT looking into the weird fact that there are so many Lakers ""fans"" who are upset at the Lebron signing. You can also get a sense of how common this is by checking out the cesspool of Facebook comments and basketball Twitter.  Most likely, you know people who are serious Lakers fans, and it's pretty damn hard to be a serious Laker fan and *not* be excited for the best player in the world signing with your team (duh). But don't assume that that applies to the general populace. Kobe Standom runs *deep*, and it's not just some fringe nutcases, but a pretty prevalent thing.  I'll also note that it's likely to get louder as the year goes on. I mean obviously if Lebron wins championships, the haters will go away. But the Lakers aren't title favorites, and when they encounter adversity, the Kobe Standom will get louder and louder and the regular fans of the team will get just a tiny bit quieter. "

Without his allstars he was getting beat in the finals or making movies with Amy Schumer. You dont see that with Klay Thompson. Also in the 60s they didnt have these elite beards. No one that can compare to a Harden or chris Kaman.  Lebron is just Lonzo who can lose his hair really well and doesn’t sell premium shoes. LeBron is clearly better.

This is set up to be a hot mess.  The best thing y’all could have done was trade Ingram for Kawhi. Kawhi is only 27 and you win this year with him, next year you get more people to join the squad.   If you get your asses handed to you this year, the shine is off the apple.  This was a classic case of scared money. "

Lebron James - On the Lakers  Lakers - In the NBA  ???
LeBron James Sr is. 
"ROY - Trae Young - hes gonna get the most opportunities to score and hes shown an ability to get to his spots in SL. He shot like shit in SL but even if his efficiency is shit hell still put up at least 14 PPG with the amount of looks hes gonna get.   MIP - Brandon Ingram or Jamaal Murray will take this one, depending on who is going to be a bugger option for their team. I’ll be a homer and say BI with 23/7/5.   COY - Brad Stevens or Luke Walton. If the Lakers finish with a top 4 record in the League it will to to Luke. It Boston wins 57+ it will go to Brad.   DPOY - Anthony Davis if he stays healthy should be a lock for this. He’ll average 3+ blocks and close to 14 boards with almost 2 steals.   MVP - LeBron James. Hes now in the biggest market in the NBA, all he needs to do is put up LeBron Numbers and finish with a top 4 seed and its his award to lose. "
"So LeBron is liable to take the TOV title in 2-3 years  If he slows down or moves off ball, Westbrook could instead take the title in roughly 4 years  James Harden would have to play at his prime level for *another 8 years* to catch Karl Malone's made FTs"
"Kawhi is our Darth Vader, the chosen one who fell from the NBA's Jedi order (the Spurs). Then we have the man behind the curtains, the Emperor, Masai. Then the rest of the team are the Storm troopers, all the equipment/ training in the world, but always seem to miss their shot up against Luke Skywalker (LeBron James)."
The difference is Lebron James 
"LeBron James has gone full White Bronco. Repeat, full White Bronco."
I feel like the improvements the Lakers make in that trade wouldn't make them better than the celtics. It's not like Boston is just losing all these pieces. They also get LeBron james. The guy has been the main reason for each of his team's reaching the finals for the last 9 years
"Fans idolize their heroes, but eventually the find flaws, magnify them, and turn their heroes into villains.  I think it mirrors what happens in childhood with our parents.  Younger fans may not believe this, but during his playing career Michael Jordan was considered incredibly nice.  It was Charles Barkley who was the bad boy.  After their careers, it turned out Jordan wasn't necessarily nice and Barkley could be nice.  Keep in mind that LeBron James redeemed himself after taking a heel turn in Miami.  It's possible that Durant's reputation will improve in the future."
"Celtics win this one, either that or Houston.    Celtics:   Stolen player - Lebron James Cut Player - Jaylen Brown  All-NBA 3rd team player - KAT  Starting five: Kyrie Hayward Tatum Lebron Horford  ————   Houston:   Stolen player - KD Cut Player - Eric Gordon All-NBA 3rd team player - KAT   Starting five:  Harden Paul Durant KAT Capela    "
"I think I just take KD and use a combo forward lineup of Durant and James. Who is my 3? Who is my 4? Who cares, both will destroy you. (Bird can accomplish the same thing but Durant is a better defender and since I have Curry and LeBron, not sure I need Bird's passing)"

"&gt; I mean, if theres an actual source, I'd love to read it, but people were just reading their lips? And iirc, that story got popular because someone on the bench said they heard it, I dont remember who but it'd be interesting if it WASNT true after all  Incorrect.  This story did not come about because of lip-reading, it came about because of Brian Windhordst's pure speculation that people took as fact.  [Here is an example of an article](http://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-steph-curry-blocked-shot-trash-talk-finals-2018-6) that runs with the story that Steph said ""Couldn't you let me have that one"", citing Windhordst on The Lowe Post.    However, if you listen to the [the Lowe post podcast episode in question](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=23669539), at 32: 25 here is what Windhordst says:  ""...when Steph goes up for that layup and Lebron pins it off the glass....and Steph turns to him, I think this is what he said, I obviously don't have a microphone recording but I think this is what he said - 'Oh you couldn't let me have me that one?'  And Steph was basically like joking, you know cause the game was over and Steph being Steph right?  He was just trying to have a little bit of fun or whatever.  And Lebron basically told him to get the BLANK out of his face...""  Everyone ran with this complete speculation, but Marcus Thompson (writer for the Warriors who got the story directly from Steph) reported that this was not the case.  [Here's an excerpt from an article he wrote](https://imgur.com/a/Hmt2Twt) that details the real situation.  Lebron actually talked first and Steph responded.  So Windhordst made that story up to make Lebron look better and Steph look worse."

"https://www.sbnation.com/2015/6/15/8780599/lebron-james-nba-finals-stats-mvp-warriors-cavaliers  One article stating lebron should have been finals mvp the year his hobbled team took a healthy warriors team 6 games.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2496459-win-or-lose-lebron-james-deserves-2015-nba-finals-mvp  Another article stating the exact same thing.  Are you one of KD's twitter handles?  He wouldn't be making alt accounts to defend his actions if anything you said was true.  Lebron beat KD's thunder team that had KD, Westbrook and Harden.  3 mvps on the same team.  Did you just starting watching basketball in 2016 like most other warriors fans?"
"Really kind of sick of this attitude. Yeah sure they get paid a shit ton of money but they’re allowed to feel upset about being traded. DeMar gave his heart to the city, took a discount on what he was worth to help the team, and still got traded. And yeah the benching sucks, but it’s freaking Lebron James. DeMar will be fine in the long run I’m totally aware, I just don’t think the way they treated him was cool. But you’re the Raptors fan, so I can’t tell you how to feel, gl with FA next season. Edit: Added last sentence"
"wait is my joke 20 years old or does it belong in diapers?!?! I can't understand your ""flame"" is my joke really old or really young? I don't get it. Bruh never said that the only LAKERS HOF that i saw were Shaq &amp; Kobe just that the only HOFers that I saw were Shaq and Kobe. But i guess that's easy for you to misconstrue when you try to jump into the middle of an argument that didn't pertain to you. Born is 77 you ass hats... I was 11 when they won the last Showtime title, 12 when the All Time Leading Scorer retired. Does that count as a Laker HOFer? How bout James Worthy? Magic still counts right?!?!? So I can't speak for you babies in Cleveland but we spot wearing diapers by age 3/4 at the latest. But since your whole town is shit, I presume everyone wears diapers for some odd reason... I won't even address the mildly racist and inaccurate comment you made about looting. I guess i should expect as much tho from ""Trump Country""... you fucking jamoke... don't worry i'll let you root for my team when you guys have another 17 win season again this year. You just mad that ""Dad"" chose our family. He doesn't love you anymore. He said he was going out for a pack of smokes and never came back. Ohios ""chosen one"" didn't chose you back TWICE!!! Why don't you put up a mural/memorial to him in Cleveland. Just like how your mom drinks and still bitches about your father leaving you but still hasn't removed his clothes from the closet.... Please can a Celtics, Bulls, Spurs, or even GSW fan please join this thread?!?! I only want to hear from ppl that win anymore... these losers are getting too much pub... YALL DONT EVEN KNOW THE SCORE OF THE GAME BRUH!!! You fuck up at every turn... i'm making a documentary called ""Cleveland: a history of losers""... and i'm going to produce it in a fire damaged building in LA. That lebron still would rather be at than anywhere in Ohio.... And who steals an xbox?!?! you broke ass mafucka. Then shits is like $299 or something. You need to step up your game. But i presume $299 is like a weeks worth of tires made in cleveland... good luck not rooting for the Lakers next year YA LOOZA!!!"
"To those who had forgotten, LeBron James and Rajon Rondo will be playing for the Los Angeles Lakers next season"
"I got this one          We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Joel Embiid.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 weeks old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple hours. So you never watched Joel in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Embiid’s game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest social media user ever, and one of the 5 best centers to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Kyrie Irving is better than Joel Embiid, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Jojo in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Joel is better.  You might be jealous of Embiid’s sick dunks, or jealous of his status as the greatest tweeter in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're volleyball fan from Africa, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Embiid isn't even a top 1000 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Joel talk to the adults. Fair?"

"""We are getting reports that LeBron James has stolen Cleveland's championship banner and is on the run"""
"What’s there to excuse? Not being an asshole doesn’t change results, being a good GM does and obviously he made the right move. Phoenix signed him to a nice secure contract and traded him straight off the bus in the same season. I think that’s worse than being traded right before your contract year in the off season with some time to adjust to new surroundings. And it’s not like Ainge sent him to the Hawks, he was given the chance to contend for a title with LeBron James. "
"&gt; if he didn't have to explain himself why did he lie when he did?  Because he felt like it.   &gt; Why bitch about deal to take a smaller one than you were offered?  Because he wanted to. Because he feels he's worth a max deal, and r/nba agrees he's a max player if he's a healthy. Because 2/40 is disrespectful to a player that we can agree is top 3 at his position if he's healthy.   &gt; How is getting limited touches going to showcase his talent that hes a max player?  Because he isn't.   &gt; Hes going to be available around playoff time when the game gets more physical coming off his injury?  Yes.   Is your biggest concern here is that you feel slighted an NBA player lied to you? You keep saying how he could've gotten the same deal from any team, as if this is only about the money. Could any team offer him the same deal, plus the option to rehab at his own pace, while also giving him a legit shot at his first championship in his career? Meanwhile, you're neglecting the fact that the Warriors weren't even his first choice lol. **The Lakers passed on him.** So if he could've gotten that deal from anywhere, and the frikkin Lakers with Lebron James decided they didn't want him, why the hell would he go waste a year in Orlando or somewhere else? Some of ya'll are so angry that a player dare take a chance by betting on himself.    "
"It's weird actually. It's the best run that the Raptors had, but it's also...not really enough.  This article will give you an idea of how bad the Raptors are in the playoffs: https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/12/raptors-playoff-problems-run-much-deeper-than-lebron-james/  Basically:  * Lost to the Nets in 7 despite having HCA. * Swept by the Wizards despite having HCA. * Barely scraped by the Pacers in 7 despite having HCA. If Solomon Hill makes his game tying three in Game 5 before the buzzer, or Frank Vogel brings in Paul George earlier in Game 7, the Raptors don't win that series honestly. * Barely scraped by the Heat in 7 despite having HCA. Although Lowry's monster Game 7 was awesome. * Scraped by the Bucks in 6 despite having HCA. Powell was inserted into the starting lineup to win 3 straight, but the Bucks nearly took Game 6 on a 34-7 run that could have forced a very uncertain Game 7. * Scraped by the Wizards in 6 despite having HCA. Should have won in 5 games tbh. * Swept by the worst Cavaliers team since 2010 despite having HCA, meanwhile the Pacers and Celtics took this same team to 7. * Never won a Game 1 ever until the second Wizards series. * Swept 3 times in 4 years.  Had Masai run it back with DeRozan, who knows. Maybe the Raptors would scrape by the Hornets before being pounded into dust by the Celtics or Sixers. Progress!  Now, for the 2019 playoffs at least, the Raptors have the best player in any playoff matchup until the Finals. A potential MVP who can get it done on both ends of the floor, and elevates his game in the playoffs as seen in 2014 and 2017."

"Lebron James played for 9 seaons taking the worst team in the NBA to the NBA finals. KD had just come from a team with 3 all stars who was up 3-1 on the best NBA team of all time.  Lebron James joining a past his prime D Wade and a mid tier all star Chris Bosh on a lottery team 3 years after the Celtics big 3 had been winning championships and going to finals for 3 years wasn't weak, it wasn't unusual and it wasn't unprecedented. The NBA lost it's damn mind over Lebron creating a team that couldn't even win a championship against the Maveriks in it's first season.   Lebron James has never made unfair moves. He's always been the center pin on competitive teams after a decade of playing by himself on the worst team in the NBA. KD never did that. He signed with a team that was instantly comptetive for his entire career and then jumped ship to the best team of all time because it was too hard.  KD joined the best NBA team of all time who already had the back to back MVP, THREE all stars, the record most wins EVER in a season.   To even PRETEND for 3 seconds that that's the same thing is an exercise in mass self delusion. "
"He's doing it to himself. Look at LeBron James for example, he's one of the most slandered players (Post-Decision, GOAT Comparisons, LA Move, Finals Record, etc.) in NBA history but he handles criticism with grace compared to Kevin Durant."
Lebron “Kyrie Irving” James Jr. 
That’s probably fair. It’s so hard to grade primary and secondary players on the same scale. Maybe what’s skewing my perception is feeling like the top 5-10 players in the league are on their own plain. So grading LeBron James as an A+ on offense and Brown as an A- feels wrong. But when you put it into percentiles type thinking. It makes more sense
I would like to thank Lebron James for being a media robot and holding this kind of shit in for 15 years.

"[Average Flight prices from Kayak, we will assume tickets are bought reasonably in advanced, not on holiday weekend, etc, so they hit those costs.](https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/Los-Angeles-LAX/Atlanta-Hartsfield-Jackson-ATL)  **Plane Tickets**  Month	|	Cost :--	|	:-- OCT	|	 $242  NOV	|	 $273  DEC	|	 $299  JAN	|	 $231  FEB	|	 $210  MAR	|	 $294  APR	|	 $270   **Game Tickets**  Average ticket prices are going to be hard to estimate. But here we go...  Earliest data I have for the Lakers and Hawks is 16-17 season. Lakers were terrible and didn't have Lebron and it cost $139/ticket on average. Hawks were ok and came off a relatively good season so likely were boosted a bit by season ticket holders buying in the previous year. Average cost was $57/ticket. Economy has been great so we will assume the economy has held up the tickets from dropping a ton, **let's assume Hawks tickets go for $50 on average the 18-19 season**.[2013-14 Cavs tickets cost $47/ticket. 14-15 tickets cost $195 on average](https://www.barrystickets.com/blog/nba-average-ticket-prices/), which resulted in a +$148 increase and 314% increase YOY. [The Lebron bump on the Lakers is actually looking closer to the % increase rather than the dollar increase](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/heres-how-much-lebron-james-is-already-affecting-lakers-ticket-demand/). Not a great example but opening game tickets are going for $425 to GET IN. In 2017-18, the Lakers' Oct. 19 opener vs. the Los Angeles Clippers featured StubHub tickets for as low as $60.   Let's assume ticket costs are on average $139*314% = $436/game  **Other Assumptions**  * Travel to and from arenas net out - public transit looks to be pretty convenient @ 30m and cheap @ $2.50 per 3 hour ride on MARTA to get to Philips Arena from the Airport.  * Parking will be fucked for Lakers games but will also be fucked at LAX. We'll assume these net out even though LAX is likely cheaper than Laker game parking * No concessions included in calc * Food you eat in atlanta outside of the game cost the same as what you would eat in LA. * Time it takes to get there is not a cost to you  **The Calculation**  Assuming the flights are the only fluctuations which won't be true since a team like the Lakers or Warriors for instance will adjust the ticket prices but let's roll with it:  ATL Game MIN = $210 + $50 ticket + [$72 hotel (average)](http://www.budgetyourtrip.com/united-states-of-america/atlanta) = $332  ATL Game MAX = $299 + $50 ticket + $72 = $421  Average LAL game = $436  LAL is more expensive without including concessions. You save $15 to $104 before concessions so up to 20 beers (or chip @104, candy @52, hot dog@33, Pizza at 26 or any combination)  can be basically free  **tl;dr** there are a lot of variables going on but yes, if properly planned and the Lebron ticket bump holds flying roundtrip from LA to ATL, getting a hotel and watching the game will be cheaper on average. This did not include concessions. "
"&gt;Right now, KD's reputation is basically at the lowest point it has ever been  Ehh... don't know about that one chief  [Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Kevin Durant Top Most Popular NBA Jerseys List](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2770986-stephen-curry-lebron-james-kevin-durant-top-most-popular-nba-jerseys-list)   "
"I thought LeBron might be good enough to carry them, and Kevin James is big enough to create a wall, but Google has him at only 5'8"" so I'm reconsidering. "
Kevin James and Lebron would be unstoppable 
"Nash's two MVPs were pretty widely panned at the time and looking back they are just an absolute disgrace to the sport.   Garnett, Shaq and James were all substantially better than Nash in 05. Nash didn't even finish in the top TWENTY in minutes, points, rebounds, blocks, steals or FG%. He was 17th in PER. 6th in 3FG% and FT%. He led in assists. He was a mediocre defender.   Then to right this egregious wrong, they gave it to Nash again in 06. Kobe averaged 35. LeBron averaged 31. Nash averaged 18. And if you say ""but assists"" then LeBron averaged 6.6 to Nash's 10.5, hardly enough to make up for the 13 point differential.  I like Nash, but he should give both of those MVP's back.   Edit: Steve, is that you downvoting me? Sorry baby."
"For reference: Lebron James and Dirk Nowitzki are the only active players with over 30,000 points "
"His quote on no one liking great things is ridiculous.  If that was true Lebron James and Michael Jordan would be the most hated players in nba history.  Instead Lebron and MJ are almost universally loved because of their greatness.  KD has every excuse why people don't like him, but he can never just accept the fact that joining a 73 win team was a weak move.  "
Time is cyclical. The same things we are saying about KD is what was said about Lebron James when he went to Miami and social media existed then. And what happened? Not 10 years after Lebron's move nobody even acknowledges it because it is so far out of sight and out of mind. The same will happen to Durant.
"Lebron james, I mean this season"
* 1) LeBron James * 2) Kevin Durant * 3) James Harden * 4) Kawhi Leonard * 5) Anthony Davis * 6) Stephen Curry * 7) Russell Westbrook * 8) Giannis Antetokounmpo * 9) Paul George * 10) Joel Embiid 
1. Anthony Davis  2. Giannis  3. Durant (Maybe a stretch at 34 but I don’t see his game deteriorating quickly)  4. Embiid  5. Jaylen Brown  6. Donovan Mitchell  7. Ayton  8. Tatum  9. RJ Barrett (Since it’s just speculation I love Barrett and can see him being one of the best fairly quickly into his career)  10. Lebron James (Will probably still average 23-8-6 somehow)
"1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Steph Curry   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard  6. Russell Westbrook 6. Anthony Davis   7. Giannis Antetokounmpo   8. Chris Paul   9. Jimmy Butler   10. Paul George  Kawhi needs to be top 5 at least. He gets a lot of flak for how he sat out last year (and deservedly so), but that doesn't take away from his game on the court. He's suffocating on defense and has a complete game on the offensive side.  Dame is a top 15 player to me. Fantastic shooter and scorer, but leaves a bit to be desired on the defensive end. He's stepped up his defensive game, but he's no Chris Paul when it comes to D. On top of that, CP3 is a better floor general who can run an offense and get others to score. This makes him more valuable overall since he improves the entire team, whereas teams who play the Blazers can focus on stopping Lillard in particular.  Embiid is fantastic early on in his career, however we need to see his high level of play sustained. I don't think he's quite there yet, but with another strong year under his belt this year I think he can crack the top 10. He's a tough matchup for anyone, but others have gotten the best of him whereas guys like Jimmy Butler and Paul George are permanent threats. It's tough to compare a center to a wing and argue their value. All of Butler, PG, and Embiid are fantastic defenders, but I think Butler and PG can shut everyone down whereas Embiid still struggles against some matchups.  Butler and PG make the list due to their suffocating defense paired with a very strong offensive game. They're similar players overall that just do it all and always find ways to score."
Without much thought into it:  1-LeBron James  2-Kevin Durant  3-James Harden  4-Steph Curry  5-Kawhi Leonard  6-Anthony Davis  7-Russel Westbrook  8-Giannis  9-Kyrie  10-Embiid

Not a bad list.   Personally mine would be   1. Lebron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. James Harden  5. Antony Davis  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Russell Westbrook  8. Kawhi Leonard  9. Joel Embiid  10. Damian Lillard.   Really just comes to perception.   The 10-20 range however is really tough   
When healthy  1. Lebron Raymone James Sr.   2. Kawhi  3. Curry  4. KD  5. Harden  6. AD  7. Giannis  8. Westbrook  9. CP3  10. Paul George
 * 1.) Lebron James   * 2.) Kevin Durant  * 3.) Stephen Curry  * 4.) James Harden  * 5.) Kawhi Leonard   * 6.) Anthony Davis   * 7.) Russell Westbrook  * 8.) Joel Embiid   * 9.) Giannis Anteokoumpo   * 10.) Kyrie Irving 
i will reveal the answer right now.   it’s lebron james. 
LeBron James. 
"I don't think it should be retired by the NBA either but calling Jordan and Lebron ""really good players"" is a huge understatement. James has become bigger than basketball at this point when it comes to the stuff he has done off the court."
Yeah it's a shame what happened to Grant Hill. He could've been LeBron James good if it wasn't for injuries.
"cool stuff OP, heres a similar search i did for LeBron and Kobe a while back:  using the parameters from OP's search adjusted for the last 30 seconds, Kobe shot 30%  Changing it to the last 15 seconds, Kobe shot 5/21 or ~24%  http://bkref.com/tiny/7QjnB  Lebron James has gone 19/48 within 15 seconds in a playoff match for 39.5%  Expanding the search to 30 seconds, LeBron has gone 30/69  http://bkref.com/tiny/JJYfW  I'm not familiar with Shot Finder on BBref (although its really cool) so im assuming OP did everything right"
Lmao Lebron James has basically dad dicked the Eastern Conference into irrelevance and y'all are mad at KD. FOH

"""Celebrity makes perverts of us all."" The best quote from [this spiked-Nike article](https://deadspin.com/just-undo-it-the-lebron-james-profile-that-nike-killed-1602381429) that actually shows what it's like to be around these guys for weeks. "
"Who's the best sprinter of all time? Usain Bolt. Who's the greatest sprinter of all time? Jesse Owens. Best is literally who the best player was. Greatest encompasses more - it's a measure of who they are in relation to their era, what they achieved, and their overall magnitude.  Jesse Owens was great. He was dominant in his era, and what he accomplished put him in a tier of greatness that no other sprinter has ever matched. Usain Bolt would beat him in a race, without a doubt. At Owens' fastest ever speed, he wouldn't qualify for the finals in the 100m these days. Usain Bolt is fast, but that's all he is. Fastest ever, but he's just fast.  Lebron James is the best player there's ever been. Jordan was amazing, but he couldn't do all the things Lebron can do at an elite level. Jordan went 6 for 6 in the Finals, and was the most recognizable athlete on the planet. Still today, people who have never seen him play buy his shoes and talk about how great he is.   There's a difference between best and greatest, hence my two lists."
"He was not clutch as a young player. Just because you linked one good playoff series does not overcome his numerous short-comings early on. I'm just gonna link a few things that I think you should be aware of.   Lebron's clutch shooting from 2007-2016 seasons. https://twitter.com/thesteinline/status/704327702845612033 Here's an article that compares this same stat and gives a bit of an explanation: http://www.espn.com/blog/marc-stein/post/_/id/4396/clutch-shots-are-tough-just-ask-lebron-james  Here's the PTI people discussing him being unclutch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IJctLSbqiU&amp;t=5m55s  Lebron James 4th quarter struggles  http://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/8778/the-lebron-james-4th-quarter-experience  List of his worst performances https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1191352-2012-nba-playoffs-lebron-james-5-worst-playoff-chokejobs-of-all-time#slide1  I'm from Ohio and I've followed Lebron since he's been in the league and have looked up to him. In his early days he wasn't clutch or at least nearly as clutch as he is now. Anyone can look at a particular series and make an argument but we have to look at his body of work in clutch situations. Did him not being clutch factor into his inability to win a ring while in Cleveland? This was a legitimate question in my mind watching him in those days. He had great playoff performances, but he wasn't like he is today. I remember one particular moment he went 0-2 on free throws in the final 5 seconds of a Miami game, and that just solidified the fact he wasn't clutch for me. A lot of narratives about Lebron aren't true, like him being a bad teammate. But the narrative that he wasn't clutch was absolutely true in his early days.    "
And Miami only gave up role players and got Lebron fucking James and Chris Bosh.
PG: Mario Chalmers  SG: Lance Stephenson  SF: Adam Morrison  PF: Lebron James  C: Javaal McGee
Lonzo Ball  Kawhi Leonard (2019)  Brandon Ingram  Lebron James  Anthony Davis (2020)
Jrue Holiday Jaylen Brown Kawhi Leonard LeBron James Anthony Davis
"PG: Lonzo Ball  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: LeBron James  C: Nerlens Noel  With a bench of Rondo, Beasley, Hart, Lance, Wagner would beat Golden State. "
47 wins is irrelevant when you add Chris bosh and lebron James in the offseason. It was a completely different team at the start of the season. Kd's move was weaker but quit with the bs that lebron joined a 47 win team. That's twisting the narrative big time. 
Lebron James is one of SAS enemies 
"The Cleveland Cavs signed Vince Carter to a one year deal today.  They say they need Lebron James Jr to have that leadership in the locker room.  On another note,  the Cavs have not returned LBJs message that he will return to the Cavs for the vet minimum and spurn the Lakers Max deal. "
"So,   Lebron James loses to the Celtics.   He literally waited until Wade and Bosh signed, to create the best team possible.   How is this any different? This man was so desperate to win a ring, he WAITED to make sure he could play with two other superstars. Lebron joined the best team possible to win it all, that team he joined was easily the best situation in terms of talent.   I understand Lebron got tons of shit for it, but KD has been getting way too much hate for his decision.   I understand the 72 win game argument (Which is pretty much trash, considering Warriors gave up Barnes, and Bogut, and some depth for Kd, hence why Warrior's SRS never came close to that 2016 season), but Lebron, relatively speaking, did the same fucking thing. The Heat had a top 2 player in Lebron, a top 3 wing player in Wade, and a top 3 big in Bosh; That's fucking insane.    Lebron's legacy is never questioned among users here, and his 2016 finals is even exaggerated.   If KD is not playing well and he's winning rings, I understand the criticism, but he's been destroying Lebron in the finals and has been insane in many of his runs.   I don't even think too highly of KD, I have Steph &gt; KD, but my god, the double standards are hilarious.  Lebron's rings are all well deserved, so are KD's  It's kinda crazy, if people believe KD didn't LEAD his team to a title, that's a perfectly fine comment to make, considering Curry is better.  But you cannot say he didn't DESERVE the ring when he shot whopping 75% against Lebron last year in the finals, and had to be guarded by Richard Fucking Jefferson and Iman Shumpert, creating a shithole defense for the Cavs.   Edit: Oh man, Lebron stans trying to rewrite history. "
Lebron would have no rings without James Jones
"Nah, James shut him down, but a lot of defenders could have at that point. It was Rose vs Wade, LeBron and Bosh.....He was gassed. He had to score or assist on everything pretty much, THEN be guarded by James."
"&gt;LeBron just takes the high-road every time.  [umm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp1J4tabsy0)  [so](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/11/14/phil-jacksons-posse-comment-irks-lebron-james-business-partner/?utm_term=.77b07a81b84f)  [about that](https://mashable.com/2017/01/31/lebron-james-charles-barkley/#HIepXAVgtOqJ)  [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoOXKha7uL4)  [i mean](https://stuffflypeoplelike.com/62408/lebron-james-to-haters-you-have-to-go-back-to-your-unhappy-lives/)  He's good about avoiding monster incidents, but it's moreso that he has a large enough base that will erase anything that happens outside the desired narrative."
"&gt; Times like this really make you appreciate how Lebron James (even if you like him or don’t) is an outstanding citizen, role model, and figure in the sports community.   Bro - KD literally won a Humanitarian award like a week ago lmao.  Times like these really make me realize how un-self aware people in this sub are"
"Yes he did, which is why he metaphorically called it the “hardest road.” He knew everyone would be critical, he knew why, and that’s why he’s constantly trying to defend / justify himself despite being one of the most well-known, talented, and rich athletes on the planet.   Can’t tell if you’re kidding, but there are many players who were not welcomed back by the team they left. Your flair, ironically, is probably the cause of the most infamous - Lebron James following the decision. "
Which of these players are worse than him?  Michael Jordan  LeBron James  Larry Bird  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Shaquille O'Neal  Tim Duncan
"Lol you really think KD was the best player in the league this year? Your delusional. Basketball is a team game. Lebron has been busting his ass in the gym for the past 15 years and it shows. He’s been the best in the league ever since Kobe’s last championship in 2010.   There’s nothing more Lebron could have done this year to beat the Warriors. The man dropped 50+ and still lost because his teammates didn’t know the score. James Harden won the freaking MVP yet his team shot a collective 7-44 in Game 7.    You have no idea what you’re talking about.  You clearly dropped the soccer discussion once you realized you’re wrong. And now you’re trying to justify KD’s decision because he gets easy rings and gets to live in a better city than OKC. LOL you really think players as rich as him care what city they live in? Every big name player spends their summers in LA or whatever city their heart desires. And then during the season they’re traveling 50+% of the time so they really don’t spend that much time at their home city.   The fact that KD took a pay cut for easy rings pretty much proves my point. He’s soft as hell. That don’t mean he’s bad, and I can definitely tell you he’s not better than Lebron. It simply means that he joined the best team ever assembled (with KD that is, but they did go 73-9 the season before) to get easy rings.  End of discusssion"
"https://www.sbnation.com/2017/8/4/16094458/michael-jordan-kawhi-leonard-nba-best-2-way-player  https://www.slamonline.com/nba/shaq-kawhi-leonard-nbas-second-best-player/  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/01/07/fundamentals-kawhi-leonard-spurs-gregg-popovich-lebron-james-kevin-durant  https://news4sanantonio.com/sports/spurs-zone/espns-tim-legler-ranks-kawhi-leonard-as-nbas-second-best-player-do-you-agree  Its almost as if players evolve and get better so those who considered the best at one point drop off and those that fixed flaws in their game move up.  And btw saying kawhi was the second best player isn't revisionist history, the majority of these are from 2016, 2017 before he got injured."
"You’re right he’s not... but if you think his teams record will be worse off than San Antonio, Minnesota, or  Denver, that’s just nuts. If I remember correctly the Lakers were about 12 games behind 8th seed. Lebron Freakin James is worth a lot more than 12 wins even if he’s playing less. Not to mention their young core SHOULD be getting better. The Lakers as built right now will probably win between 48-53 games."
I love how you exclude a 26 year old Lebron James from this.  Such a joke how you guys give him a free pass. HE WAS THE ORIGINAL RING CHASER!
"I just want to provide some material to enhance understanding on how truly great this guy is.  Summary of the Video:  PEAK SEASON NUMBERS  - Wade, in his best season (2008-09) recorded 30.2 PPG, 5.0 RPG. 7.5 APG, 2.2 SPG, 1.3 BPG (for a guy 6'4??), and a whopping 30.4 PER - For PER comparison, and in their best seasons, Iverson held a 24.0 PER, George Gervin a 24.0, Reggie Miller a 20.8, and Clyde Drexler a 23.6. - Wade, in his best season (2008-09) averaged 49% from the field, 56.7 TS%, and EFG of 50.4% - For efficiency comparison, and in their best seasons (in order of FG%, TS%, and EFG%): Iverson (42.5, 51.8, 45.2), Gervin (50.4, 56.4, 50.7), Miller (47.1, 61.4, 54.4), Drexler (47.2, 54.7, 48.6)  KEY ACCOLADES  Dwyane Wade - 3x NBA Champion - Finals MVP - Scoring Champion - 12x All Star  Allen Iverson - Regular Season MVP - 4x Scoring Champion - 11x All Star  George Gervin - 4 Time Scoring Champion - 9x All Star   Reggie Miller - 5x All Star  Clyde Drexler - NBA Champion - 10x All Star  Note: Iverson clearly beats Wade in Regular Season accolades, however Wade sacrificed some regular season accolades by allowing LeBron to come to Miami and join forces to go to 4 straight finals together.   2006 NBA PLAYOFFS  Dwyane Wade led a 33 year old Shaq, Udonis Haslem, a 35 year old Alonzo Mourning, James Posey, a 37 year old Gary Payton and Jason Williams.  He led his team to the Eastern Conference Finals in his third season (imagine Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, or Jamal Murray putting up postseason stats in their third seasons like below- all entering their 3rd seasons)  Eastern Conf Finals against the 64 win Pistons coming off 2 consecutive finals appearances and a championship:  27 PPG, 6 RPG, 5 APG, 62% FG, 81% FT  NBA FINALS 2006  After 2 sub par performances on the road in Dallas in Games 1 and 2, and obviously falling into a 2-0 series deficit, Wade went onto to lead the Heat to 4 straight victories and the Miami Heat's first championship in Franchise History, on the back of these numbers, here are the key games:  Game 3: 42 PTS, 13 REB Game 4: 36 PTS Game 5: 36 PTS, 10 REB, 5 ASTS, 4 STL, 3 BLK  AVG: 35PPG, 8RPG, 4APG, 3SPG, 1BPG  John Hollinger wrote in 2012, that this series performance by Wade, may have been better any of Jordan's 6, ahead of Magic, Bird, Kobe, or Duncan, Russell.  ""Whilst it seems strange to having anyone besides Michael Jordan in the top spot for the greatest finals performance of all time, the truth is, Jordan never dominated a finals series to this extent. Many called Wade's 2006 finals ""jordanesque"". They may have been selling Dwyane Wade short"".  Definitely a debatable quote by Hollinger, but you get the message about how great it was.   WHAT HAPPENED AFTER?  For those who aren't aware, Dwyane made a decision that he would later regret for the rest of his career - choosing to remove his meniscus in his knee in college after listening to poor medical advice.  The meniscus plays a crucial role - without it the long term risks to knee damage are severely high, including loss of cartilage amongst other ailments. For more info on Wade's injury history, here's a link:  http://heathoops.com/2013/11/through-severe-knee-injuries-dwyane-wade-continues-to-endure/  After winning the championship in 2006, D-Wade battled the knee that was beginning to show bad signs and his body began to give up on him, leading critics on the path of wandering if Wade was going to be the next T-Mac - possibly the greatest who never made it there. He missed super large chunks of the ensuing 2006-07 season, as was shut down for the majority of the 2007-08 season, where the Heat finished with a mere 15-67 record, leading to the selection of Michael Beasley with the 2nd overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft.  The critics at the time were out there loud and clear after multiple knee and shoulder surgeries: ""Will Dwyane Wade ever be the same he once was?"" - with the latter agreeing to ""No."" LeBron James enjoyed a remarkable ascension during these missed years that Wade was out.   Wade worked out with Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant's trainer during the 2007-08 season and 2008 offseason, Tim Grover, who believed Wade wouldn't just come back to the league, he'd be back at a higher level.  Well that statement turned out to be an understatement. Wade went onto lead the 2008 USA Olympics Team in scoring (off the bench), and played a pivotal role in delivering the Gold medal after Team USA's loss to Argentina only a couple of years prior (the Redeem Team).   And that was just the beginning of Wade's monster return.  In 2008-09, Wade led a supporting cast of  rookie Michael Beasley, Mario Chalmers, Udonis Haslem, Daquon Cook etc to 43-39 and a playoff spot.  He joined 2 other players in NBA history to rack up 2,300 points, 350 rebounds, and 500 assists in a single season.   Those players are Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  And he didn't even win the regular season MVP this season, It took an all time campaign from LeBron to trump him. Lets look at their 2008-09 stats side by side:  D-Wade 30.2 PPG (1st) 7.5 APG (9th) 5.0 RPG 2.19 SPG (2nd)  LeBron 28.4 PPG (2nd) 7.3 APG (10th) 7.6 RPG  1.7 SPG (7th)  LeBron that year, had the 12th most win shares of all time (the most since Jordan in 96'), led the Cavs to the best record in the league, it took that campaign to trump Wade's amazing all-time season.  WRAP-UP:  During the LeBron Heat years, you could clearly see with every season that went by, Wade's knees were just not up to the task of the gruelling grind of the long postseason runs.   In 2011 against Dallas, had the Heat won that series and LeBron not have had a shocking series, he would have been named finals MVP.  From 2012, Dwyane had decided it was best to take a clear backseat to LeBron, in order to preserve his longevity in the league, due to the health problems mentioned above. Imagine the luxury of having quite possibly the best second option in league history - because we all know when D wade was 80%+ healthy, he'd go tick for tack with LeBron when they went up against each other, and you couldn't really see a major gap between their playing abilities.   In 2012 Against OKC, he played a massive back up role to LeBron averaging 20+ PPG alongside him.  In 2013, you could begin to see LeBron taking even more of a larger role due to wade's health decline. Wade averaged less than 20PPG that series, however had a key game 4 that was essential to avoid a 3-1 series deficit. From there it was the LeBron show.  LeBron left straight after the near sweep to the Spurs in 2014, as this was the peak season of Wade's ability decline. He could see his health has set him back where could no longer be that old D-Wade, so the timing was perfect to return home and make good on his life long promise of delivering that city a championship.   It's amazing how Wade is considered a top 3 SG despite all this adversity he had to go through with health issues that it leaves us to think - IMAGINE had wade enjoyed the health fortune of LeBron throughout his entire career. There was a reason he was growing comparisons to the young Michael Jordan during his prime years, and it wasn't a laughable comparison.  He slashed like him, shared his explosion to the rim, his relentless at playing at full intensity and throwing his body around, and delivering in crunch time moments.  He offered all of us moments that I will pass onto my kids one day, an all timer, a first ballot, and a player you could always count on, over and again.  Just as you thought he was finished over the last 3 years, he started to tease us with vintage Wade flashes and moments, like the clutch performance that stunned Charlotte against the purple shirt man. Or the return to Miami after 2 long years away, and hitting the dagger in Ben Simmons face to remind him he was a rookie.  We'll miss you, man.          "
The answer is always LeBron James
Cavs - LeBron James      Heat - LeBron James      Lakers - LeBron James 
"Here's the last 9 MVP awards, I think you'll notice a trend and which one doesn't fit...   * 2008-2009 LeBron Jame MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2009-2010 LeBron James MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2010-2011 Derrick Rose MVP: ....LeBron led the league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2011-2012 LeBron James MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2012-2013 LeBron James MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2013-2014 Kevin Durrant MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2014-2015 Steph Curry MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2015-2016 Steph Curry MVP: Led league in win shares per 48 and value over replacement player.  * 2016-2017 Russell Westbrook MVP: Led league in value over replacement player. (Durrant led the league in win shares per 48).  If you provide more value than the next closest player in the league you pretty much get Most *VALUABLE* Player. The only exceptions to that rule in the last 10 years are Kobe Bryant in 2007-2008 and Derrick Rose in 2010-2011. Personally, I think LeBron should have won both of those MVP awards."

"Like it was said guys are going to have ups and downs, nobody is going to hit every clutch shot so you look at it as a whole as their career goes on.  See I think we have different examples of clutch too. To me clutch is when there is a lot on the table. If your team makes misses the playoffs every other year then yes a regular season buzzer beater could be a clutch moment because ultimately you know that you need every victory you can get to be able to make the playoffs. A team that is a perennial high seeded playoff team does have the same value on regular season wins and it's usually not clutch.  I think LeBron is decent in clutch situations as a whole, he wasn't clutch early. The started building it a little but then had the epic choke in 2011 and has been more hit than miss since then but has his share of misses. My point was earlier you said that LeBon is the most consistent because there is no clutch. Let's say there is no clutch which I don't believe. LeBron's 2011 was epic and there have been other players who have never done choked to anywhere close to that level. How is LeBron ""the most consistent"" then? I'm not even arguing that LeBron isn't consistent, I saying how is LeBron 2011 James the MOST consistent? Most implies more than ANY other player.  Again this is why guys shit on LeBron. Could just say one of the most or amoungst the most but went straight with the most. Smh LeBron Stan's are the reason his murals keep getting defaced, not Lebron"
"Just googled it, you mean this?  &gt; Asked what rookies have caught his attention this year, he didn't mince words.  &gt; ""None,"" Simmons responded promptly. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James], [Stephen] Curry, Russell [Westbrook]. Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""  &gt; ""I don't really listen to comparisons,"" Simmons said. ""You can compare players and whatever it is, but at the same time, everybody is their own player.""  &gt; ""Coming off a broken foot is definitely not an edge, but people are always going to say what they want to say,"" Simmons said. ""But at the end of the day, this is my first year in the league. If you're a guy coming from overseas, you're still a rookie and you can be 30 years old. So there's a rule in there.""  &gt; ""Who would I pick? Me, 100 percent,"" Simmons told ESPN at the Ritz-Carlton in downtown Philadelphia on Saturday.  &gt; ""I think I have been playing solid all year,"" he continued. ""If you look at the numbers, you will see. People who know the game know.""  &gt; ""He put me in position as the point guard, and I don't think he thought it would work out this well as it has,"" Simmons said. ""I think it is a lot of credit to Coach for sticking me in that position and trusting me.""  &gt; And although the Rookie of the Year award may be the first personal goal he would like to obtain, he has loftier goals in sight.  &gt; ""Championships,"" Simmons said. ""I want to be the Defensive Player of the Year ... MVP. There's a lot of accolades I want to get, but I ultimately want to win a ring.""  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23089422/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-says-100-percent-rookie-year  Doesn't sound cocky, sounds like every athlete ever. Faith in himself, competitive, lofty goals, but credit your coach, object to direct comparisons, just say you're chasing the greats. ""No other rookie impressed me"" is twisting his words."
How the fuck can you continue putting out banana yellow jerseys when LeBron gatdang James just joined the team.
Lebron James is a Hobbit who must cross middle earth to destroy the one ring of power. The best part is Lebron is depicted as a hobbit but I want him to be his actual size. 
LeBron James Harden have 8 of the last 10 lol. 
So true.  This sub's main problem is that they're too young to remember how great lebron james is.  If only their were older people on here to talk more about how great lebron is all the time /s
Offensively Lebron was at his absolute best last season. He’s declined slightly athletically (yes he’s still one of the absolute most athletic people on the planet but it’s unarguable he used to be even MORE athletic than he is now) but his skills have gotten better. His shot is better than it’s ever been. But his defence took a huge decline. He can still lock in and play defence for stretches but it just isn’t the same. It’s tough to say but as an overall player I’ll most likely take 2013 James even if last season was his best offensive season. 
"Klay Thompson &gt; Lebron James    Better shooter, better defender "
Dude is 2 plays from being 1-8 in the finals while constantly changing teams for better situations. Freaking James harden just got 3 wins off this warriors team in one series while LeBron has 1 win in 2 series. Like missing all your shots in overtime

"I mean, you didn't say anything wrong (assuming your stats are accurate). The guy is the most clutch player in the NBA and he hasn't made game winners or tying shot in the finals. It can be interesting.  I haven't seen any more clutch player than LeBron James."

"&gt; LeBron is all about promoting LeBron  If he was, he would've named the school ""LeBron James Elementary School"" or something like that. But he didn't. If he wants to put his pictures inside the school, then so be it. I know you're a troll, but you're not even doing a good job of that. "
"lebron james is 33 lol, Cousins was a one-and-done and hasnt been around nearly as long as Lebron , even without check his age you could tell hes a lot younger than lebron just based on that"
"&gt;On Monday, LeBron James sat down for an interview with CNN's Don Lemon to promote a new public school that his charitable foundation -- along with the Akron school system -- helped build. In the interview. James and Lemon talked about race, President Donald Trump and the state of the country.  &gt;It's worth checking out the entire interview -- it's only 15 minutes long -- but one line from James in it really jumped out at me. Asked by Lemon whether life was harder as an African-American living during Trump's presidency, LeBron responded: ""No, I think it's always been there, but I think the President in charge now has given people -- they don't care now. They throw it in your face now."""
"If you want a coherent argument here it is: After Shaq signed here which he openly admitted was influenced heavily by the entertainment industry you’ve been dry for free agents for years. The Shaq Kobe teams were surrounded by basic role players or aged out players looking to hop into some late career success. After Kobe and Shaq’s issues it scared off free agents for years as no one wanted to sign in LA and play next to Kobe. But every year there was always rumors of who you’d get and it never happened.   Then, you stumbled into the Pau deal which made you look like a genius when in reality Memphis at the time got fleeced (Marc Gasols value was a throw in at the time) and dealt a disgruntled star not all that dissimilar to how the Kings lost Boogie for not much at all. Now you look competitive and got Artest on his last legs looking for a ring. Once Paus career went sour you tried for the next big thing which was getting Dwight in a trade, not signed as a free agent. The moment Dwight could leave he did, practically ran outta town by Kobe and by how the fans treated him during the season. Then , after treating him terribly the Lakers had the audacity to put up a billboard begging him to stay and he fled. Now that he’s gone the billboard comes down and now it’s like you never wanted Dwight back anyway. Kobe’s on a fat contract preventing significant moves, a dumb trade for Nash set you back years and no one wants to play next an old grumpy Kobe while fans on Twitter photoshop player after player in a Laker jersey, and Adam Levine literally makes an Aldridge jersey which was memed to hell. An old , talentless roster with no cap space. You were not a free agent destination.  I’m comes Magic who goes for a total youth rebuild and clears a ton of cap space. Just in time for Lebron who was looking to move into a huge market as he is clearly ready to move into the mogul phase of his career. He even openly stated recently he thought about joining the Rockets or Philly but wanted to help a team more in need. This doesn’t sound like a ring chaser , this sounds like someone who wants to be competitive to a respectable point while pursuing the things important to him off the court. Credit to Magic, he built a positive environment out of a negative one. Which is impressive and is what made Lebrons move possible. If you were in the same situation you were in two years ago he doesn’t come.   But to say you have been a dream FA destination is absolutely revisionist history as before James it was about twenty years before you were a FA destination. That’s what an actual argument looks like if I wanted to have one to prove my point. Congrats you’ve been humored. Now when I say “enjoy your clout” that was a que for me saying to you it’s not that serious. But that went over your head "

"Expecting to be downvoted, but as a moderate I can’t stand when athletes get involved in politics. Do I love Trump? No. Do I hate Trump? No. I watch professional sports because they traditionally keep politics out of the picture and it’s something everyone can enjoy.   LeBron James is a great basketball player and has done many great things for young Americans, but I don’t see the point of him continuing to go at our president. I understand people don’t like him, so go out to the polls next year and vote to deny his re-election, calling him out over the Internet and interviews to drum up attention comes off as pushing his own agenda rather than taking steps towards a different outcome in the 2020 election.  And before people comment on my username, H.W. Bush was a fantastically stylish man, and fashion is a hobby of mine, I wasn’t even alive when he was president.  Peace and Love "

"I don't think GSW is as invulnerable as everyone pretends.  The Rockets were up 3-2 vs the Warriors, and with huge 1st half leads in both G6 and G7. Their main lineup was:  - Chris Paul / Eric Gordon - James Harden - Trevor Ariza - PJ Tucker - Clint Capela  Seems like any of those 5-permutations is better than this Rockets mix, given that you're replacing PJ Tucker with Giannis/Lebron and Clint Capela with Anthony Davis."

" &gt;Joker and Murray are better than any current member of the lakers not named Lebron James and it’s not really close   Joker I understand.   But Murray? I would rather have Lonzo even though Murray was better last season. I think Lonzo will be the better than Murray by end of his rookie contract. Murray is good, but very inconsistent player in all regards.   Harris is better than Murray IMO and better than anyone currently on the Lakers young core. Unless the Lakers young core guys make a massive leap next season, that won't be changing.  As it stands based off last season. Jokic and Harris are better players than anyone on the Lakers currently outside of LeBron. "

"Not the 2006 FIBA world championships, but related nonetheless...     *At the Beijing Olympics, surrounded with such talent and possibility, the Cleveland Cavaliers began to lose LeBron James to free agency. The beginning of his departure came in small moments on the daily bus rides through the city’s choking smog and bigger ones on the basketball court. Together, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and James kept talking about the summer of 2010, about the chance of a lifetime to chase championships and roll like a touring rock band.*      *And yet before Pat Riley’s free-agency vision for the Miami Heat could ever be validated, James had to first become a member of that 2008 Olympic team. The public never knew what those on the inside of American basketball’s elite power structure did: In the years and months before Beijing, that was very much in doubt for James.*      *Back when the Heat’s three new superstars had signed short contract extensions and started to explore the idea of free agency thrusting them together, a different discussion had played out within the NBA and USA Basketball: What should we do with LeBron?*      *From Team USA coach Mike Krzyzewski to managing director Jerry Colangelo to NBA elders, the issue of James’ immaturity and downright disrespectfulness had become a consuming topic on the march to the Olympics. The course of history could’ve changed dramatically, because there was a real risk that James wouldn’t be brought to Beijing based on fears his monumental talents weren’t worth the daily grind of dealing with him.*      *When the mandate had been to gather these immense egos and get the NBA’s greatest players to fit into a program, no one had a more difficult time meshing into the framework than James. Other players made it a point to learn the names of staffers and modestly go about their business without barking orders and brash demands.*      *No one could stand James as a 19-year-old in the 2004 Athens Olympics, nor the 2006 World Championships. Officials feared James could become the instigator of everything they wanted to rid themselves for the ’08 Olympics. For as gifted as James was, Krzyzewski and Colangelo subscribed to a belief that with Kobe Bryant joining the national team in 2007, they could win a gold medal in ’08 with or without LeBron James. Behind the scenes, officials had taken to calling James’ inner circle, “The Enablers.” No one ever told him to grow up. No one ever challenged him. And yet, James was still a powerful pull for his teammates, and everyone had to agree they could no longer let his bossy and belittling act go unchecked. These weren’t the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Team USA wasn’t beholden to him.*      *After the NBA witnessed the behavior of James and his business manager Maverick Carter during the 2007 All-Star Weekend, the commissioner’s office sent word to USA Basketball the league wouldn’t force James on them for the Olympics. Before Team USA gathered for the 2007 Tournament of the Americas in Las Vegas, an unmistakable message had been delivered to James through Nike: Unless you change, we’re serious about leaving you home.*      *“Legacies were on the line,” one league official said, “and they weren’t going to let LeBron \[expletive\] it up for everyone in China.”*      *Through Nike, James ultimately heeded the message and became more tolerable to coaches, teammates and staff. Team USA assigned Jason Kidd to babysit him at the Tournament of the Americas in 2007, to try to teach him something the Cavaliers never had a veteran to do: professionalism.*      Basically, Lebron was young and immature, wasn't professional, and didn't know how to win. It did take a while for him to ""grow up"" out of that phase. I think he should get a pass because he wasn't the Lebron we know now. Team USA was a mess before the Redeem Team. Not even Duncan could do anything to help that squad in 2004.      [http://www.webcitation.org/5u6WgX5XH](http://www.webcitation.org/5u6WgX5XH)"
Lebron James with regards to human lives!
"Normally I wouldn't care, but with your denigration and holier than thou attitude, I think it's time you been taught the truth about PR vs reality.    i.e. The LeBron James scholarship foundation which LeBron has been praised near universally for in sports media and online discussion forums. You know, the one where LeBron is paying for all those kids to go to school in Akron?     Reality: The $41 million is being paid entirely by the University of Akron's scholarship fund, LeBron is simply being used as the face of the campaign. The University has been in shambles for the past decade and is hoping to use LeBron's brand and reputation in order to increase their own public standing. LeBron gets free PR, which helps his brand both in promotion, sells, and his endorsement potential.    And here is the truth, straight from [LeBron's own foundation website](http://lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org/page/universityofakron#uaoverview)   &gt;THE ANNOUCEMENT At the 2015 Family Reunion at Cedar Point, our families received news that would change their lives forever. They learned that JPMorgan Chase would be dedicating a technology team to develop software to track the academic progress of Foundation students. That The University of Akron’s College of Education would be renamed the LeBron James Family Foundation College of Education. **Most importantly, they learned that in conjunction with the Foundation and its partners, The University of Akron would provide Foundation students (who meet a certain set of requirements and graduate from Akron Public Schools) with a tuition and fees scholarship to The University of Akron.**      Also given these are at risk children, it's very likely that many of them will not meet said qualifications down the line and thus will forfeit their scholarship. The real amount to be paid out by the university of Akron could be far less than the ""promised"" 41 million.

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there. People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant. The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.   Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime. And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores.

With TT and JR, management had lots of leverage but not 100%; they were capped out ans could not get a suitable replacement. And no team would have done a sign and trade for the contracts/money TT and JR were asking.  With every top superstar, there's a pressure not to waste his prime years; to build contenders.

Second Cavs stint = The Ghost of Tom Joad / Live in New York City / The Rising / Magic. Took his career in a surprising direction before releasing an absolute comeback masterpiece to shock the world. Later efforts still excellent but not with the same level of efficiency as earlier work (Win shares / amazing songs per album)  Lakers stint = Wrecking Ball? Trying some new things with a new supporting cast. Interesting and enjoyable, and remarkable output at this stage in his career.   I missed a few albums out to make the narrative fit, but the main point is that they both go out and give it everything they have night after night after night when logic suggests that they should both be winding down at these stages of their respective careers.

That would just guarantee him another 3 Finals losses. Embiid is there best player and is a big and LeBron isn't a fan of bigs taking up the paint.  The Lakers have a lot of young talent, is the top location and have one of the best cap situations in the league.

"I was wrong on the claim he felt he was a lesser star than LMA, however my point about being second fiddle to LeBron is correct.   https://www.ibtimes.com/kawhi-leonard-rumors-spurs-star-prefers-clippers-over-teaming-lebron-james-2697744  &gt; However, in a big twist, it seems the 28-year-old is now having a change of heart according to ESPN.com's Michael C. Wright, who said on Thursday that Leonard does not want to play second fiddle to the three-time NBA champion.  &gt;""The Lakers are not Kawhi's preferred destination anymore,"" Wright told the Back to Back podcast, as quoted on Bleacher Report. ""He wants to go to the Clippers. Because he doesn't want to go and be second fiddle to LeBron. That's what I was told. I was told by somebody that would know. So right now the Clippers are where he wants to go.""  There's also some quotes from Shams suggesting Bron being in LA could alter his opinion of going to the Lakers. "
"Maybe I dreamed it, but I thought there was a report that he wanted to be *the* guy for a team, and LA at the time had no one. Now obviously James is there so if he thought second fiddle to LMA or Timmy was rough, he'd be in for a wake up call when LeBron eventually pulls the ""I have no help"" card. "

"Agreed. This was a fucking no brainer for so many reasons.   If he loses to anyone in the playoffs, “Whatever the Lakers are fucking terrible”  If he loses to Golden State, it’s not another Golden State Beating LeBron in the Finals Season  If he wins the ship somehow, it’s equally as impressive as what he did in Cleveland, plus he’ll have led 3 different teams all the way  Live with his family fill time in LA and build his businesses too and just fucking chill out and be Lebron James living in Los Angeles and not sweat anything since your legacy is secure  Why would y’all think he was gonna do anything else "

"&gt; LeBron's legacy is already set in stone regardless if he wins one in LA or not.   What are you basing that on...?

"Actually let me put it another way:    - If we really look at what you're saying, you're saying there's an actual cutoff to how many stars you can have, and what level those stars can be.  It's ok to have LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and it's ok the have Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.  But you can't add another star?  Of course you can.  Any team or fanbase would want that.  That's never been a rule.    - So where's the talent-level cut-off?  If we get Paul George instead of KD, is that ok?  Where's the talent cut off?  Can you pinpoint it on a number?  It's ok to get the 3rd-best player but not the 2nd?  Or it's ok to get someone who is 11-20, but no one in the top ten?      - You see how ridiculous it sounds if you critically look at what you're saying?  We built a super team.  It involved some luck.  Quit whining and come and get us."

You'd think Jerry fucking west would be able to work out some trades to free up space if LeBron James showed some interest lmao
"I didn't say he'd drop 100 points lol. That's retarded.   No shit I don't know, no one will know. You can still use common sense to a degree. I bet if you put up a poll and asked if MJ would be better or worse if he worked on his 3 point shot, a solid majority would say better. Obviously. He's a competitor and still regarded as the GOAT, you don't have to go that far out on a limb to guess that if he were to play in today's NBA, where everybody and their grandma jack up threes, he wouldn't focus on shooting threes or improve.   Like if LeBron wanted to play like Karl Malone for a whole season, post up, back to the basket, I would wager that he'd get in the gym and probably improve his post up game, because he's ya know, LeBron James. Same basic logic with MJ."

That's quite pathetic  &gt;    FYI, without the ""super rich"" folks funding money on places, there wouldn't be a education systems, hospitals, police stations etc.. There wouldn't be any internet, or video games, or cars, or phones, or literally anything everyone loves and depend on.. There wouldn't be any Hollywood without people funding, there wouldn't be any tv shows , and the music industry would be dead. There wouldn't be Reddit, Youtube, or anything literally  &gt;   Everything is created/discovered because some of the ""super rich"" funded on things. EVERYTHING is run on money. This world would be stuck in the old age, without the money and the super rich funding on things    &gt;   I know, that countless rich people are the worst human beings in the world, who cares about nothing but themselves.. but there was and there is countless super rich people who gave and gives back more to the people and never forgets to show gratitude, never forgets to be a nice ass person, and really cares about the people.   &gt;   LeBron James is one one of them.. He ain't some super rich folk. He never had a father, and nobody still knows who is his father.. Dude was raised by a single mom and he comes from poverty. He built his entire empire all by himself.   &gt;  Dude was labelled ""the chosen one"" at age 16, and his highschool games were covered by ESPN and all other big networks. Since age 16/17, Bron has been under the tiniest media microscope. He was offered $10million from Reebok when he was 17, and even at that age, he was not greedy and stupid, but smart enough to decline that and wait for Nike, Adidas or Jordan. Nike ended up offering that kid $90 million shortly afterwards.. Now LeBron has the only lifetime billion dollar Nike deal, and he'll be officially a billionaire even before he hits 35, and dude's still nowhere near retirement  &gt;  Not even ONE black or negative scar, even at this media centric day and age. LeBron is still happily married to his high school sweet heart, and has bene a great father, something he never had himself. Now that's a role model  &gt;   **Bottom line** is, LeBron is a legendary player, might even be the GOAT, but he's an EVEN GREATER human being, which sounds surreal, but 100% true.. That's what Jemele Hill just mentioned. So she's absolutely right. If you can't understand that simple shit, then you are just an imbecile, who's just miserable.

"&gt; Dude had to play lebron james year after year with his best player as kyle lowry no disrespect but u need more than kyle to take down a guy like lebron.  It's funny, I remember Kyle playing out of his mind that series. Shot like 72% TS and did everything else at a high level. Kyle provided as much gravity as he could with his shooting while defending well. DeRozan did everything imaginable badly, the worst of which was letting the ghost of JR Smith and Kyle Korver shoot lights out from 3 the whole series, when they were garbage against Indy and Boston. But no, blame Kyle. You're obviously a salty Raptors fan that's sad DeMar got traded. I liked the guy too, but his struggles in the post season cannot be understated. It was time to move on. "
Having the pressure on beating lebron james in his own conference which hes been ruling is too much to put on a guy whos not top 10

I think you could make an argument that JR Giddens is better than LeBron James 
I know I am in the minority but I give Kareem the slight edge over Jordan in terms of being the GOAT. 1. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 2. Michael Jordan 3. Bill Russell 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Lebron James 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Magic Johnson 8. Tim Duncan 9. Shaquille O'Neal 10. Larry Bird
"............... oh yes, if Lebron James could develop a better jump shot and better portability, he could easily be the goat.   If Tim Duncan was more dominant offensively, Tim could easily be the goat.   It’s pretty fucking hilarious, once again, if his shot selections were so bad why is his offensive Impact always so high?   Why is this complaint about defense not held on to Lebron, Harden, Etc? Whose defense has been far worse than RW by every impact metric possible? So defense is suddenly needed to be an elite player but completely forget most players in the top 5 are pretty fucking average at it? If not horrific?  Funny how this works, right? You guys have some weird hatred for this guy. "
Lakers won 35 games while being injured. Are we really saying a healthy team with lebron James is only 6 games better? 
Lebron James?
"&gt;if LeBron gets injured for a couple of weeks or has a mid-season slump   That's the funny thing, because San Antonio has a higher chance of missing the playoffs in the West right now, than LeBron getting injured or having a ""slump"" lol It's LeBron James fam, he's the sole definition of *consistency*, which is one of the most underrated aspect about him and his whole career "

LEBRON JAMES WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
Imagine having the young Lakers who won 35 games last year to only around a ~6 game improvement with LeBron James and a year under Kuzma/Lonzo/Hart. Ill be honest we had so many winnable games last year but lost to our poor FT shooting.   I cant see the Spurs missing the playoffs either with DeMar who will play if hes healthy
1. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 2. Michael Jordan 3. Bill Russell 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Lebron James 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Magic Johnson 8. Tim Duncan 9. Shaquille O'Neal 10. Larry Bird
"Agree with this.   1/2. Lebron/Curry 1/2. Lebron/Curry 3. Anthony Davis 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antekoumpo  Pretty definitive Top 6. I won’t put Kawhi there after this past season, but he would also be in this group if he returns to pre-injury form.  Ignoring Kawhi, I would probably go Butler 7th, Westbrook 8th, but I could see the case for Chris Paul over him. "
"The bar gets lower for LeBron the further the season goes on. Back in October there was a contingent of fans who argued the Cavs had a shot to win the Finals, by May it was ""LeBron James just getting to the ECF is one of his greatest achievements."" "
Literally nobody's opinion of LeBron James has changed since he went to Los Angeles. He isn't rated ANY differently than he was 2 months ago.   You're just being extra ~~soft~~ sensitive because he's your player now and you're noticing it more.
"Is lebron james a hof lock?  he's pretty good, but is he good enough?"
"And got fucking swept lmao  Lot of good their “bench mob” and top 5 offense + defense did for them.  What’s more believable? That every Toronto raptor actually has a mental block to competing with LeBron James, oooooor the Raptors just weren’t as good as their record and advanced metrics would have you believe.   I think it’s easily the later, especially considering the 3 other teams the Cavs faced pushed them to 7 and swept. "
"I honestly thought you were commentating and was waiting to hear ""This guy will be better than LeBron James"""
"Let me tell you a couple reasons:      -He's by far the superstar with the lowest bbiq;      -He doesn't play 'all out' as his fanboys seem to say, he slacks off on defense more than anyone except for lebron james;         -Farming triple doubles by not contesting shots to get rebounds and other shenanigians ;      -Most people who hate him think his mvp was undeserved;        -He is extremely selfish having gone through countless different coaches and not changing his playstyle one bit. He refuses to move off ball and seems to prioritize stats over winning.          Inb4 Carmelo does well in houston and WB again will look bad. "
"Yea, Dirk’s legacy is exempt from negative criticism because LeBron James got a tattoo at the age of 18 and said something at a pep rally that hurt your feelings. Wtf kind of logic is that "
"1. Anthony Davis (I think he is almost there now, if the Pelicans can replicate the success of late last year this won't be a fringe opinion) 2. James Harden 3. Kevin Durant (but in decline of course at this point) 4. Joel Embiid 5. Giannis  I think Embiid will play Giannis due to better defense and a better PG to feed him shots. I won't rank Kawhi until we see him play again at an elite level, he definitely makes the top 5 if he is great this year. Ben Simmons has a chance of making the cut too if he gets a halfway decent jumpshot.  I just don't see LeBron being top 5 in 3 years personally, obviously I could be wrong. I still think he will be all-nba level though, just on a lower team. I think Curry will be in decline by this point enough that he won't be top 5 either. Westbrook was the hardest to leave off for me, I definitely think he will still be in the mix for top 5 in 3 years."
LeBron James 😥
I'll take a LeBron James for the Bulls
Charter schools exist across all community spectrums so while some cost money from parents others do not. The main difference is that there is a private industry running the school not the school board(public). In some areas they get all their money from government because the state allows it to run the school with public funding.  Other charter schools are test based and are for specific studies (math and science).   It makes a difference in the Lebron James school as since it is public it means it’s not being run as a business(charter school).   
"I support the topic of the post.  Thompson, being trashy, would of course punch someone for pointing out the truth. The truth being that he cheated on the mother of his child, and filmed himself doing so, as trashy people tend to do. And the other truth being that he's a trash player on a trash team, and would be irrelevant were it not for LeBron James"
"Ok so while this is a very humorous comparison, what exactly is this $8million figure referring to? Because people are acting like it refers to the overall cost of the entire school, and at a glance I can tell you without hesitation that isn't even close to right. It's not even in the right ballpark. Do you guys have any idea how expensive stuff like, everything is? Salaries and benefits for not just the teachers, but all the administrative staff?  If you could educate 200+ kids for 5 years for $8million, man would education be a lot easier.  So a brief Google search for where this $8.1mil figure might be coming from, the best I can find is [here](https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/the-multimillion-dollar-school-support-and-resources-pour-into-lebrons-i-promise-school-opening-monday). This is the amount that the school is projected to *cost the local district* over the five year stretch. This article doesn't have a figure for how much the school itself costs, and says  &gt; The LeBron James Family Foundation has led the way in time and funding, though officials say the exact amount it’s given is unknown because the support has been a combination of financial and in-kind donations, some of which are still being quantified.  &gt; Others in the community, like the Hudson-based Peg’s Foundation, also have made hefty financial contributions.  So not only are people treating the $8mil figure as the amount Lebron donated (when it's literally the amount that he *didn't* donate), I don't see any figure for how expensive the school is overall. And if you're comparing ""the cost of educating a child"", looking at the cost to the local district in a school that is notable for its charitable fundraising makes no sense.   I can't tell what people think that $8mil figure is referencing. As best as I can tell, it's just referring to the costs of the school to the local government, which is a pretty random and arbitrary statistic that doesn't provide any context. If anything, I think some very confused people might not realize that it costs the local district *anything*, when uh, it's still a public school. It's just receiving a substantial amount of funding support by Lebron and other people he's gathered together."
"Joel Embiid, Udonis Haslem, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Rajon Rondo, LeBron James, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Lauri Markannen, John Wall, Bradley Beal, Dwight Howard"
"Doesn't make any sense. Ya'll basically didnt have Kawhi last year, so adding any positive starter in place of that should be great. Adding DeRozan should add a couple more wins, not 10 more losses.   We're only 6 games better adding LeBron James lol. "
"People are really sleeping on this Lakers team. It's not like we won 17 games last year. That was so 3 years ago! We're a 35-win team. Do people really believe adding LeBron fucking James to that doesn't carry us into at least 48-win territory? I can break down how we get there. I think we start off slow, but end the year on a high note. Get either the 4th or 5th seed.   Also should mention, this feels like shit ESPN is creating just to stir up drama. Every show is going to be talking about this today. It's a day of content, so why the hell not. "
"I would disagree, LeBron James appears to be very intelligent; never had any scandals, made sound business decisions, and puts a very high value on youth attending college.  And maybe on the Knicks, where the GM is a dumbass, player intelligence wouldn’t mean much, but brad and Danny are smart enough to be able to use jaylens physical and mental gifts and turn him into something very special."

This dunk just happened but Jayson Tatum over Lebron James this playoffs has to be my number one and I’m not even a Celtics fan. That dunk was absolutely insane 
"I am somewhat of a ""Lakers sympathiser"", but I don't really like Kobe. His rape case was definifely not helpful for his legacy. At best it was adultery which I am not a fan of either. Thankfully we have role models like LeBron James and Steph Curry in the NBA now. "

"Let's destroy this awful argument;)  &gt; Point to where I said Kobe got open looks. I said Shaq was the center of attention and priority one for the defense, and teams were built around stopping him.  But I can give you heaps and heaps of film where teams were fixated on trying to stop Kobe. What game plan are you talking about? Like I said, It's always one playing hard double against Shaq; this has always been the case.  Almost every playoff highlight of Kobe's features heavy dosage of horrible spacing and tons of defensive fixation. To a point where you can watch two-three players follow Kobe in a possession.  &gt; That's retarded. Yes, Shaq was not an efficiency juggernaut like a Curry or a LeBron, grinding big man ball is less efficient than guard or wing play, but he was a fucking dominant force and it's absurd to suggest Kobe was hurt by playing next to him just cuz he clogged the paint.  Is Cuz a word? lol  Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? Shaq is one of the least portable superstars ever. He has no ability to move without the ball and dominates only one portion of the floor. Dude, are you suggesting he's actually portable compared to Kobe? Are you actually trolling? Wait, you know what's even more hilarious? Shaq was relatively average in PnR as well lol.  So, outside Shaq's individual brilliance, how come most players saw stagnation, even inefficiency when coupled with Shaq?  That stuff is why portability matters. Unless Shaq is paired with a Ray Allen or Kevin Durant he is going to obstruct the imprint his wing will have...an alternative way to conceptualizehis stiffing of the offense blunts the otherwise (presumably) additive effect of talent stacking (as indicated by whatever +/- metric you are using). We see it over, and over, and over again. There is too much overlap in the areas of primary expertise and not enough off-ball elevation that can't be found at the exact same level in a role player. When paired with O'Neal Kobe/Flash/Penny's playmaking is de-prioritized in favor of Shaq's post-passing and, because they aren't spot up giants (Penny being the best of the three) their giant step back in productivity does not correspond to a rise in efficiency. Because of where he sets up defenses can still trap whenever the wing and Shaq are on opposite sides and not have to worry about Shaq fading to the far corner for an open jumper. When they penetrate he's a great big body to have as an off-ball finisher but he isn't special or GOAT-tier in this regard...guys like Deandre, Tyson, and pre-injury Bynum provide just as much if not more synergy when used as a P&amp;R partner and off-ball finisher (heck, just watch one of the 1st 35 games of the 2008 Laker season for confirmation...the league wasn't ready for it – he rocked a 127 ORTG off Kobe lobs and dumps).     &gt; The 90s East was not horrible like the 00s East or 10s East. I also never said it was more ""impressive"", I brought up Shaq turning 3 teams into championship contenders to counter your bullshit claim Kobe is more ""portable"" and ""there's no discussion"".  LOL no.   Magic's route to the finals featured total opposition SRS of around  6.6. Their best competition was the decent Pacers. They played a bad Celtics team and a Bulls team that got a rusty MJ. He was also given some incredible supporting cast as well.  Lakers is clearly a given; one of the most dominant players ever while wearing this uniform.   Heat? Shaq was given such wide open looks from wade, was missing most clutch situations (Missed around 40% of all close games in the playoffs that year), AND was incapable of playing a fundamentally sound defense. Dude, this is a clear example OF HIS LACK OF PORTABILITY.    Probably a good time to mention considering you seem to lack the actual knowledge to have a decent conversation:    Portability does not mean, at all, that one player is better than another; KD is probably the most portable player I have ever seen and is so much more portable than a guy like Lebron James. Is KD better than Lebron tho? Fuck no.   It's just another piece to the puzzle.   &gt; Literally cannot literally. Really struggling with words, at least when they're not analytics buzzwords.  Sure, so what does cuz mean? lol  &gt; Never denied Shaq's defense, just not letting you gloss over Kobe being a sub-50% true shooter in 02.  Once again. when adjusting for positional average efficiency, their difference is around 3%. Not really that huge of a difference. LOL.    &gt; You're actually the one fixating on efficiency, citing tons of modern analytics about an era before analytics dictated strategy. I imagine you think Barkley was better than Shaq?  .......I used efficiency to highlight how Shaq actually deflated many of his teammates' output. All data supports this, and efficiency is one of the easiest ways to prove it. How else should I prove it? LOL  When have I ever claimed this: ""citing tons of modern analytics about an era before analytics dictated strategy.""? Dude if you are unable to understand the most basic concept, why are we having this conversation? Positional TS is essentially average ts for each position and difference between a 2 and a 5 is almost always around 3%.  "
"Lebron James obv  Edit: The Chosen One, grows up without a dad, single mother, gets drafted to home team. Has very well-written failure arcs (leaves home and still loses) before ultimately triumphing with the back to back in Miami. The Spurs make a great philosophical antagonist. Popovich gives an incredible monologue in the ""older japanese mentor"" voice they always have.  And then the return to the Land, and another loss, and then..."
I mean he should be ashamed of himself. Big Lebron James. What has he ever done
"I'm already fed up with hearing about Lebron James' 13 year old kid.  Set your kid up for failblog.org, or, just like Jordan or Kobe did, let your sons play speak for itself.  Or just emotionally cripple him. That'll do too  For all we know the kid likes to model clay, not play basketball. The media interference is going to be strong with this until it's NOT  "
"Team B: First off, there's a huge mismatch with Ilgauskas and O'Neal, and I'd say a prime Gasol and Bosh are close to even. Team B's defense with Artest, James, and Shaq is fairly dominant, but the three guards on Team A can definitely score. Even if Kyrie, Wade, and Kobe were having a decent game offensively, I think the big guys on Team B (including James) could reach the same amount of points on more efficient shooting. Nobody on Team A is really capable of stopping Shaq, and they've got Gasol to space the floor along with LeBron who can do whatever they need him to do. I don't see much resistance against their attack. Another notable mismatch is Fisher and Irving. Fisher is solid and by no means a liability, and I don't think they'd need to depend on his offense anyway. He fills his role out, and Artest can hold his own against the backcourt."
Lakers future does not depend on Kawhi at all. Magic already did his job when he got Lebron James. Plus there are other good free agents next season if Kawhi doesn't come. Trading your entire young core for Kawhi/PG is a stupid thing to do. 
Lmao how does kyrie work better with teammates?   He didnt want to work with lebron fucking james.    Meanwhile everybody whose played with russ has nothing but positive things to say
"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-kyrie-irving-waxes-poetic-about-playing-with-lebron-james/  &gt;Since he was in ninth grade, Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving has had a relationship with LeBron James. Irving went to James' camp twice, and when he was sidelined with a foot injury at Duke, the superstar dispensed advice. When he was drafted by the Cavaliers a year after James left, he had to answer question after question about his mentor.  &gt;Now, obviously, the two are teammates and trying to win a championship. On Friday, Irving was asked if James is, right now, playing better than ever. He paused for a few seconds and then had whole a lot to say.  &gt;""I was just speechless,"" Irving said. ""I became a fan, to be honest with you. I just told him that it’s a different feeling when you’re on a team with someone that you’ve watched for so long. When you get to see them up close and the work that he puts in, the dedication that he has and the drive and the will that he has, he literally, I feel like we all just — we were together, I don’t want to say we jumped on his back, but we were all there for him. He was doing his thing, but I think the true testament of him is that he embodies a leader that leads a team.  &gt;""The true testament of the word ‘team,’ I feel like, is embodied with the guys that we have here,"" he continued. ""We have so many different personalities, so many different guys. When you have a leader like that that brings you up and lifts you up in every situation — there’s never going to be a time where you look at him and he’s going to look frazzled or look like he doesn’t know what he’s doing. He always knows four steps ahead and it’s just like, ‘Whoa, I wasn’t even thinking about that, like, what the heck? He saw that coming?’ So it’s just a learning experience and you’re just constantly, constantly on your Ps and Qs because he just expects you to be at your best, and he wants you to have your best.  &gt;""So if you have a guy like that, the basketball stuff will take care of itself. I mean, he does amazing things. I appreciate seeing that, I don’t take that for granted, but the nuances of the game that just go unnoticed sometimes, that not everyone can see or experience, it’s just a different feeling.""  &gt;Irving finished off by saying, ""Great speech by me, by the way. 'Cause it really came from the heart. Crazy."" He's right. Irving has spoken about the bond between the two of them on the court during this postseason, but he hasn't quite said anything like this. That's a heck of a quote.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78WUmIPXuIo  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/lebron-james-kyrie-irving-celebration  https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kyrie-irving-lebron-james-2017-18-mvp/"
"He had a 48.7 TS% in the playoffs that year. It was a miracle that they got to the finals that year.  Chicago got super fucked by bad RNG, Butler locked him down. First of all, they should have went up 3-1 if the refs properly called a technical foul on David Blatt for calling a timeout with no timeouts left. Beyond that, they got further screwed with Pau Gasol getting injured and missing the last two games of the series....  but that's not where they got fucked, RNG is where they got fucked. While Butler shut Lebron down (46.0 TS%), the rest of the Cavs became godly from the field. Mike Miller 75 TS%, Dellavedova 70.4 TS%, JR Smith 68.3 TS%, James Johnes 65.2 TS%, Tristan Thompson 60.2 TS%, Kyrie Irving 58.5 TS%. Unbelievable efficiency from the supporting cast. "

"Low-key the Heat have a chance to be a top 3 defense if we get everyone healthy back. Our biggest defensive liability who plays a lot is Wayne Ellington and even then he hustles for everything and puts 100% effort. Winslow and JRich are all defense type defenders. A healthy Hassan showed that he could be a elite rim protector in 2016-2016 when he stopped hunting for blocks. James Johnson can guard 1-4 effectively and is one of the best LeBron stoppers in the NBA. Dragic is will give up his body to win, same as Tyler Johnson. KO isn't a great defender but he isn't bad by any means and Bam has shown that he can guard guards effectively, and if he adds more mass then he could guard the best bigs in the NBA."
Lebron James is the Greatest basketball player ever.
"But LeBron has come off the bench. In the 07-08 season he asked to come off the bench to offset any negative reaction fans might have toward Varejao, who during messy on-and-off negotiations and said he didn’t want to play for Cleveland again.    “I thought it would raise the intensity of the fans, having me, Larry and Andy come in at the same time — and it worked,” James said. “I thought by coming in with Andy it might stop some of the boos Andy might get, just protecting my teammates.”"

"&gt; Do guys like ur cousin work at it as hard as Bron or Curry? &gt;  &gt;   Have you ever seen LeBron James up close? He doesn't look human and he's so wide (not fat) that you think he was a statue.       Curry is  a great example, but remember he had Dell growing up. "

LeBron James Net worth $440 million - plays basketball.  Tiger Woods Net worth $740 million - plays golf.  Hmm...seems like its better to play golf than basketball because you get to do whatever the fuck you wanna do AND you get paid more.

Did they have enough capspace to sign LeBron James after resigning Nikola? Or are you assuming Paul Millsap is traded before LeBron James is signed? 
LeBron James is who we all wish Michael Jordan had been.  We are lucky to have LeBron.

Lebron James and being a terrible role model
"So is your argument that the stats listed here which OP used to predict MVP determine outright who the best player in the NBA is? If so, that's fine. My point of view is that because of what he brings to the table, I would rather have LeBron James on my team than James Harden. Harden and Dantoni work wonders together, and the offensive scheme run in Houston is conducive to high scoring. Obviously Harden is a phenomenal player but there's a reason almost everyone but Skip Bayless would still say LeBron is the best in the game: he isn't in a great system with a great supporting cast, he isn't reliant on drawing fouls, he's still very high efficiency, he's still the best passer in the NBA, his BBIQ is the highest in the NBA among all-stars, and though his defense has gotten worse, it's still there when he uses it. I stats indicate a lot but these models created by OP rely on what statistics were favored in MVP voting throughout the years. It's not some be-all end-all for best basketball player, that's still a subjective thing that can't be defined. Hell you might think Harden is better than James, but I have a feeling that your flair influences that and OPs models favoring Harden influence how seriously you take those models"
"Wow, this single video makes me feel like LeBron James is the greatest player of time. I am a casual Thunder fan and I don't follow the Cavs or LeBron for that matter, but know of his scoring ability and playmaking, but this part of his game was new to me. His awareness and creativity with the ball is staggering. Really wish I had started watching the NBA when he was initially on Cavs and then on Miami. Some of those plays are mind-blowing. "
"&gt;leadership? they just signed LeBron James, so that isn't it.  Leadership? Lebron? Wait until mid-season when he complains about the team being top heavy.

"He's reached peak confidence in his offensive abilities. Before you could still make LeBron second guess himself by taking away his comfort zone and forcing him into being a jumpshooter.

"Smart plays the Draymond role of being the vocal defensive floor general calling out plays and coordinating players in our switch-heavy defence.

So if he is only paying half the bill why is it called the Lebron James school?
"You know just enough to be more uninformed than somebody who never read the headline of [that article](https://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/08/whos_paying_for_lebron_james_n_1.html). If you actually read it, you'd see the following quotes:  &gt;The exact breakdown of expenses for the new I Promise School is unclear, since the district and the LeBron James Family Foundation are still sorting out final details of their contract. But the district will pay more than half the costs - perhaps around 75 percent - once it is fully running.  &gt;The foundation says it's spending about $2 million for the school's first year, including startup costs. It has also committed to spending $2 million or more a year when the school has grown to capacity. The exact amount is still to be determined.  &gt;The foundation says it has spent about $2 million this year, largely to redesign and refurnish the building at 400 West Market St., a district building which has been used for several schools over the years. Most times, it was a temporary home for students while their main school was being demolished and rebuilt.  So of the $8 million/year that the school will *eventually* cost, James has committed to spending **at least** $2 million/year, and as much as $4 million/year. He's already spent $2 million retrofitting the building.   And that's just the cost to run the school. It doesn't include the cost of providing every student a bike  &gt;James and the foundation have also provided each student with a bicycle. James has said that he used to ride his bicycle to escape his neighborhood at times, so he wants students to have them.  Free tuition  &gt;And then there is James' offer of free tuition at University of Akron to students in the program who graduate. **They're not official costs of the school**, which stops at eighth grade and doesn't include high school, but are part of the program's mission.  and coordinators and social service people to help these at-risk kids in ways that the Akron ISD budget can't allow for.  &gt;This year's costs also include hiring two people to manage the ""wraparound"" social services the school will have for students. The school will follow the same pattern of providing social services to students - like counseling, health checkups, food pantries, clothing and tutoring - used by districts like Cincinnati and Cleveland, along with a few other Akron schools.  &gt;The foundation will hire a coordinator for the school, who will work with different service agencies to locate help for students. Sometimes other agencies provide the services for free, though there can be costs at times.  You saw an article propagate that LeBron will spend at least $2 million/year on just the running of the school, and they made it click-baity so that people would click on it (they didn't have exact numbers, used guesswork, said he would pay *just* $2 million/yr, and left out the costs of coordinators, bikes, and tuition, as well as retrofitting the building) and you gladly spread that misinformation around like you knew something.

They are the exact same player.   Dame's most recent playoff run was the worst of his career. Kyrie's came on a team with LeBron James.

"Thank you.  Median would have been MUCH more useful to see.  On average, you are not getting Paul George with the first pick.

"There's a difference between ""I wouldn't be surprised if he did"" and ""he's a lock."" Those are two very different things.  A lock means that, unless the guy becomes OJ Simpson, he could not score a single point for the rest of his career or do anything else and he'd be in the HOF. LeBron James is a lock.

"&gt; Didn't vote for him. &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Don't like him.  Defending him anyway though.   &gt;And you wonder why I'm questioning your rationality?  Tbh I don't really rate your ability to reason very highly.  I've my point pretty clearly, multiple times, and all you've apparently gotten is ""wait, I said I didn't like him, why are people still saying I'm full of shit?!?""  Lemme sum up my point: Lebron made what is, in the end, criticism of Trump's policy.  You may agree or disagree with it, but it was something he clearly believes and something that is arguably valid, given the clusterfuck that has been the NFL kneeling thing.    Trump responded with insults.  No defense of his policies, no attempts at spreading understanding or seeking dialogue, just flat out insults.    Now leaving aside a shitload of other factors (the president of a country really shouldn't be resorting to playground insults, for starters), the issue I (and other people, based off how much you got downvoted at the start) have with your comments is that you seem dead set on redirecting the conversation towards what fault, if any, James has in this scenario.  In your view, it appears as though James is also at fault for this because he gave his personal views on a social topic which is very much related to who he is as a black athlete.    You've repeatedly tried to shift the conversation and blame towards Lebron, with statements like ""well, he threw around insults too"" (even though that was over a year ago) and ""well, he isn't helping"" (which lead to your very flawed analogy).  So what, Lebron simply shouldn't comment on social issues?  ""Shut up and dribble""? Do you really not realize why you're coming off as a Trump supporter?   Oh, and since you've refused to answer the question, might as well pose it again:  &gt;Trump's tweet was him being a douchebag, LeBron's response (not what he said before Trump's tweet) was him calling Trump a name and throwing an insult on top of it.  Lebron has not, to my knowledge, responded to Trump's tweet.  Are you making this up?"
"There's a major difference between ""does he have a chance at getting in"" and ""is he a lock to get in"".  LeBron James is a lock to get in. Andre Iguodala has a chance to get in. There's a difference.  Zydrunas Ilgauskas might not even have a chance to get in, let alone be a lock."

"Him learning how to shoot like young Lebron is like saying Don learns how to pass like 26 year old Steve Nash. Its not impossible but its also really improbable. Everyone on the list can have ""the highest ceiling"" if they somehow become a below average guy on something that they currently do not posses. Imagine if Jayson all of a sudden is half the playmaker that Jimmy is or Jaylen getting half of James Harden's handles. Again, its not impossible since player development isn't linear and superstars sometimes come from guys you never thought would even be a top 20 player but the chances of them becoming serviceable on their biggest weakness has a super slim chance of happening "

Durant has literally outplayed LeBron head to head, in the regular season, and in the postseason excluding stats vs sub 45 win teams, which LeBron got 1-2 free series a year against in the East to pad his stats while KD was facing legit contenders every round. Just look at 2014. KD faces the 50-32 Grizzlies and DPOY Gasol in the 1st round, who played at a 60 win pace when healthy, as they were in the playoffs, the 57-25 Clippers and CP3 in RD 2, and the 60-22 win Spurs and Duncan/Kawhi in the WCF who annihilated Miami in the Finals. Meanwhile LeBron faced the 43-39 Bobcats and 22 year old Kemba in round 1, the 43-39 Nets and 38 year old Paul Pierce in rd 2, and the Pacers team that collapsed down the stretch winning 10 of their last 26 games after the PG13-Hibbert drama.

"Probably because advanced metrics are largely a joke and are heavily skewed in favor of ball dominant players rather than efficient players.    i.e. can anyone explain to me how Jordan had equal if not better advanced stats in 1998 than Durant did in 2018?     **Context is irrelevant in terms of Durant's role being easier than Jordan's as that is void in the role of advanced metrics. They are simply measuring statistical impact of players relative to league average adjusted for pace. The argument isn't that Durant's season was more impressive, it's discussing how advanced stats could have possibly reached that conclusion when they're simply analyzing numbers in a vacuum.    Note: Advanced stats use pace adjusted numbers, so here are their stats adjusted to 100 possessions    |Rk|Player|Season|Age|FG|FGA|FG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PTS| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2017-18|29|13.1|25.3|.516|7.4|8.4|.889|0.6|9.0|9.6|7.6|1.0|2.5|4.3|37.1| |2|Michael Jordan*|1997-98|34|14.9|32.1|.465|9.6|12.2|.784|2.2|5.8|8.1|4.8|2.4|0.8|3.1|40.0|    |Rk|Player|Season|Age|G|MP|PER|TS%|WS|WS/48|OBPM|DBPM|BPM|VORP| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2017-18|29|68|2325|26.0|.640|10.4|.215|5.0|0.7|5.6|4.5| |2|Michael Jordan*|1997-98|34|82|3181|25.2|.533|15.8|.238|4.6|0.0|4.6|5.3|  So Jordan attempted 6.8 more FGA, 3.8 more FTA, averaged 1.6 more OREB, 1.4 more STL, and 1.2 less TOV. Since it's assumed a possession=1 shot attempt=1 stl=1 tov=1 oreb and the coefficient of 0.44 is used to determine the possessional value of a FTA relative to a FGA, Jordan used 4.272 more possessions than Durant.     With those 4.272 possessions, Jordan managed   2.9 more points, 3.2 less defensive rebounds, 2.8 less assists, and 1.7 less blocks.    Let's just assume that blocks and defensive rebounds are completely worthless to a team, which is absurd.    Jordan averaged 2.9 more points and 2.8 less assists on 4.3 more possessions. Let's say that assists are irrelevant as well and the scorer is the only one that deserves credit, how the fuck is Jordan considered superior when he scored 2.9 more points on 4.3 more possessions? That's 0.67 points per possession, barely half of the NBA average(1.06). You telling me that somehow makes them equal in value? Jordan 1.6 less points for his team than expected not even including Durant's 2.8 more assists, 3.2 more drebs, and 1.7 more blocks.    Here's another example where somehow assists become hugely valuable again despite being of no value in the above    2015 LeBron vs 2018 Durant playoffs    |Rk|Player|Season|Age|GS|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PTS| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2017-18|29|21|807|13.1|26.8|.487|8.4|9.4|.901|0.8|9.2|10.1|6.1|0.9|1.5|3.1|37.5| |2|LeBron James|2014-15|30|20|844|14.2|34.1|.417|7.6|10.5|.731|2.3|11.8|14.2|10.6|2.1|1.3|5.1|37.7|    |Rk|Player|Season|Age|G|MP|PER|TS%|OBPM|DBPM|BPM|VORP| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2017-18|29|21|807|25.1|.606|5.7|0.8|6.4|1.7| |2|LeBron James|2014-15|30|20|844|25.3|.487|5.9|5.1|11.0|2.7|    LeBron is +7.3 FGA, +1.1 FTA, +2.0 TOV, +1.5 OREB, +1.2 STL which works out to 7.084 possessions.    With those 7.084 possessions, he averaged 0.2 more ppg, 1.1 more dreb, +4.5 assists, and 0.2 BLKs.     If 98 Jordan is ~= to Durant in PER with    2.9 more points, 3.2 less defensive rebounds, 2.8 less assists, and 1.7 less blocks on 4.3 extra possessions    how the fuck is 2015 LeBron~=2018 Durant with   0.2 more ppg, 1.1 more dreb, 4.5 more assists, and 0.2 less BLKs on 7.1 more possessions.     Using the 1.06 multiplier(NBA league average ORTG) for average points per possession, LeBron's example is telling me that an **assist is worth roughly 1.63 points** excluding DRB and BLK, which are irrelevant as 18 RS Durant has even higher discrepancies over 98 RS Jordan than 15 PO 18 PO LeBron over 18 PO Durant.    Meanwhile Jordan's example is telling me each assist is worth **-0.59 points.** Yes, that's a negative.    so -0.59~=1.63 according to PER??     Using the same value for assists from the Jordan example, LeBron's 7.1 more possessions should yield 9.9 less points than expected if the possessions were used at random by a league average player     There's 0 consistency. Not to mention that if you apply a static value for assists making for the differential between LeBron and Durant career wise, Stockton should be the GOAT according to advanced stats. And yet he's nowhere close    "

Dirk championship had a lot more to do with Jason Terry &amp; Lebron James than reddit wants to admit.  
"&gt;To be fair, weren’t Jordan’s midrange shots very efficient. I’m on mobile so I can’t quite look it up, but Jordan was never really an inefficient player, except from the 3, which was really due to the fact that the only 3’s he’d shoot were incredibly difficult last second shot clock shots.  Jordan was an amazing midrange shooter. I'm not saying he was an inefficient scorer, just less efficient than Lebron. Midrange shots are in principle less efficient than 3's and right-at-the-basket shots. Sure, Jordan was significantly than pretty much everyone else at making those midrange shots but they are still inefficient uses of a possession. This isn't Jordan's fault: people back then didn't fully realize how much more valuable 3's were.  &gt;Also defense was different, I’m not enough of a basketball historian but every single basketball analyst and previous player had said that defense was a lot tougher back in the day, especially due to the lack of space that’s generated nowadays.   This is a common idea, but it's not really true. Players from that era are the ones on TV so they like to talk about how much tougher everything was in their day. In reality the biggest change has been the legalization of the zone. The lack of handchecking now does a bit to offset this but not nearly as much as people claim. Just think about it, handchecking helps a defender prevent an attacking player from getting by him and into open space. An even more effective way of doing this is to have another player strategically cover the space just behind the primary defender. Modern defenses are zone/man hybrids, and teams practice and perfect this much more effective style of play. The talk about how much tougher defenses was back in the day is largely just plain wrong. There were some cases of physical play that wouldn't fly today, but generally speaking todays players are more athletic and better practiced at team defense. The per game scoring in the NBA was much higher in the 80s-mid 90s than after the zone was legalized, and has just started to come back up due largely to the 3 ball revolution. The data and the eye test just doesn't support the idea that scoring was harder back in the 80's and 90s. It's actually exactly the opposite.   &gt;If Jordan shot 100% from contest midrange shots, then they’re efficient for him. It doesn’t matter if everyone else shoots 30% from there.   But he didn't. And no one else does either, because it's impossible. There's nothing magical about the midrange, especially the long 2 midrange. Stepping back a few feet, you get a favorable tradeoff between the lower chance of hitting the shot and the greater value (3&gt;2). It's all about what maximizes the amount of points you get per possession. Some midrange shots are totally acceptable given the game situation: defenses will succeed in cutting off the more efficient options and when that happens a midrange shot is OK to settle for. The midrange FG% a player would have to have in order for those shots to be consistently better choices than 3's or drives is not possible to attain.   &gt;I think this is closer than you’re giving Jordan credit for, but I think the sheer size of Lebron helps him in this category.  I certainly didn't mean to imply that the gap between them was huge--my bad if that's how it came across. Jordan is arguably the best player ever, and reasonable arguments can be made for either him or James. Efficiency is just an empirical thing we can calculate so there isn't much room for disagreement when it comes to Lebrons being more efficient than Jordan. How much you value that is a matter of interpretation though. Personally, I value it greatly because I think generating the highest Points Per Possession shots consistently is the best way to win. A lot of this is era dependent: Jordan played in an era where it was ok to take a shitload of midrange jumpers. This would be a terrible strategy in today's game.   &gt;I don’t think he sounded like an asshole in his post  I just got annoyed at the immediate ""enough of this zone bullshit"" response.  Anyway, thanks for the reasonable comment."

Jordan is not the best mid-range shooter. Durant is. Dirk is better too. Lebron shot 42% from 10-16 feet this year same as James Harden. That's very good.
The tuition for Akron is not being funded by James. Not sure you were saying that but it kind of reads that way.  I appreciate LeBron is working with public schools to try and fix the issues with education in lower income / disadvantaged areas.  I just hope he worked with educators to understand what could work -- too often rich people come in with money and put their vision into place instead of people who understand more.
"Conventional wisdom is four generations. So the James clan will be new money until Bronny's grandkids. Or, roughly around the time LeBron exits his prime, if that helps visualize it better."

I think it’s tough to compare efficiency across generations, but if you have the time I’d like to see a comparison between Jordan and players in his positions efficiency vs James and people in his positions efficiency during their respective eras. I’m sure from there we can get a fairer relative efficiency accounting for league differences.   The type of shot matters for the greater statistic analysis, but when you’re talking about an individual you have to stop thinking about things so generally. If Jordan shot 100% from contest midrange shots, then they’re efficient for him. It doesn’t matter if everyone else shoots 30% from there. As I said, not sure about the statistics for sure, but I always remember Jordan as an efficient player for his time period. Also Jordan was a very good driving player, he had entire systems built around him to stop his drives. I think this is closer than you’re giving Jordan credit for, but I think the sheer size of Lebron helps him in this category.   Just a secondary note, I don’t think he sounded like an asshole in his post. It seemed like a reasonable discussion to me, but I’m a third party so I might not understand the nuances of your discussion. "

"[Here](http://time.com/money/5354265/lebron-james-i-promise-school-akron/) is a brief article that goes over multiple facets of the school including funding. It wasn’t the exact article I read but it does go over the jist of what I said.

"Sure, I'll expand. Fans have historically been quick to discredit a player's MVP season based on his postseason performance. Westbrook's 2017 MVP campaign was shaded pretty hard after his first-round exit and Nowitzki's 2007 run was treated as a punchline when he had to accept it after his team had already been eliminated.   Typically, LeBron James is the best player in a given NBA postseason, so during the playoffs, fans malign anyone who else who won the MVP, even if that player had a superior or more consistent regular season than James. I think that if the NBA threw in a third MVP award for the season, the soft power of winning a reg. season MVP (most current hardcore fans can name the MVP from every season they've watched) would be greatly watered down.   Fans in future generations would look at the three lists (reg. season, playoffs and Finals MVP) side by side and the more exceptional regular season runs of recent history, like Derrick Rose's 2011 or perhaps Steve Nash's 2005 and 2006, would be totally disregarded.   The more long-term consequence? Every great player would rest at least a quarter of the regular season, because the allure of winning an MVP would be greatly diminished from its current pedestal. It simply won't be worth a player's health or effort to attempt a truly great reg. season campaign if they can simply lock in during the playoffs.   So much already rests on the two months at the end of the season; if we're being honest, much of the regular season isn't worth the time investment unless you're a diehard fan of a player or team. Players vying against each other for the MVP create one of the major storylines that make the 82-game slog worth it. I'd like to see the award and the reg. season at large retain their importance, even if it means great individual playoff runs are shortchanged.  "

"I've seen a shit ton of your posts blowing LeBron bro, we all know what's up.  First I think times in LeBron's career he has had more help than Jordan at other times less help. You said he has done more with less. Let's pretend like James has had less, how is how 3 titles more than Jordans 6? Even if he has had less which I don't agree with he would have done less with less which doesn't confirm anything.  Point is until LeBron started losing guys didn't hudge every series by number of all stars. You guys make LeBron look worse, you guys make him look mentally week who can't overcome anything and goes into series with a losers mentality because they other team has more all stars. That's not how Dirk approached it"
"&gt;But Harden won 3 games against them this year and had a very good shot at win 4 if CP3 doesn't go down.  Maybe because he's playing on an inferior roster.

Lebron does this and its a toss-up overtime game lol.   &gt;If other guys can win with less top players why is it an excuse for someone you claim as the goat?  Nobody in this entire thread has mentioned Lebron=GOAT so why are you even bringing it up? Seriously? It's like every Jordan fan in existence is itching at the opportunity to shit on Lebron because he's knocking on the door.   Also to elaborate on this point: Lebron has done more with less throughout his entire career. Aside from 2011, name an achievement in which he underperformed, or even performed at the expected rate.

"&gt; The series is titled “Shut Up and Dribble,” taken from conservative pundit Laura Ingraham’s remarks to James in February when players from the Golden State Warriors declined an invitation to the White House after the 2018 NBA Finals. The controversy serves as a prologue to the series as it chronicles the modern history of the NBA and its players, starting with the 1976 merger of the freewheeling ABA and the more conventional NBA of today.  &gt; The league soon became an incubator for many of its top athletes to grow their brands beyond the court, becoming powerful players in commerce and fashion, and transcending the game to become cultural icons. It will premiere on Showtime in October.  &gt; “Shut Up and Dribble” is a presentation of Showtime Sports Documentary Films and James’ SpringHill Entertainment. James will executive produce along with Springhill’s Maverick Carter and Rich Paul, Martin Desmond Roe, Chris Uetwiller, Datari Turner, and Gotham Chopra, who will also direct.

"Russell Westbrook has been top 5 in MVP voting the last 4 years (ever since he missed half of the 2014 season to get three different knee surgeries).    Only LeBron James can say the same.     Westbrook was an MVP caliber player long before he actually won his MVP, and while KD was still on the Thunder. "
"Margin of victory was absurd. There's really no point to mentioning the predicted result of the series if the series has already played out. This is like falling back on the notion that Jordan was an underdog in 1991 when in fact Vegas hadn't factored in Byron Scott and James Worthy's injuries which played a significant role. Part of my ""underdog"" commentary is supposed to reflect how much control Lebron/Jordan had over winning the series.   &gt;got outscored by Kawhi in those games  Just blatantly untrue. He outscored Kawhi in Game 4 and 5. "

Other notable shooters who have played with LeBron and shot over 1.5 3's per game at above league average efficiency are Mike Bibby, James Jones, Kyrie Irving, Mario Chalmers, Shane Battier and JR Smith. And that's aside from Love, Frye and Korver and at that higher metric. Guys like Mike Miller are on the cusp.  By contrast, [here](https://i.imgur.com/JomQlDc.png) is the offensive firepower Jordan had when he averaged 8 assists in a season.  And yeah, this isn't to diminish LeBron or circle jerk Jordan, but let's stop acting like situation isn't relevant.

SA explaining to Kawhi what's happening is no skin off their backs, in fact - it's important because they need to relay his input to the teams that are looking into him. That is a completely different situation than Toronto, who has a star player that they want to keep happy, and all of a sudden they are offered a very lopsided trade opportunity to make their team better.  edit do you think if LA offered the spurs lebron james for rudy gay that they would consult Gay before pulling the trigger? obviously that's a bit more extreme of an example than DD for Kawhi, but I think the Spurs front office pull the trigger on a trade like that, and then break the news after the fact because there's no way that what Gay thinks of that scenario matters to them. They aren't going to not do the trade because Gay doesn't want to. "
"LeBron isn't paying for the tuition, it's being paid entirely by the University of Akron's scholarship fund, LeBron is simply being used as the face of the campaign.

"Since you did not read the article   Just because Jordan didn't publicly speak about issuses does not mean he did not do anything. Jordan wanted to be a symbol of black empowerment. In terms of pure monetary contributions Jordan has donated way more than Lebron.   &gt; To dismiss these words and deeds as merely taking care of friends and family, is dismissing them as sellouts too. It's saying Deloris Jordan raised a sellout and James Jordan's name is on a foundation that does nothing. That the tens of millions of dollars in scholarships his associated foundations donated have affected nothing. It is avoiding the fact that all of these endeavors andmore are almost solely for the betterment of underprivileged black and latino families. It is ignoring the S.T.E.A.M. curriculum of his programs, the effective utilization of corporate sponsorships, and their striking similarity to the foundations of LeBron's I Promise school.  &gt;Just as the highest ranking black executives within Nike work for Jordan Brand, more black executives work for the Hornets than any other team in sports, including the NBA's only black COO, Fred Whitfield."
"He did this though, he changed the over 36 rule to benefit himself and his friends in power at the NBPA.

From what I have seen that is not as much as the LBJFF has put in. 2. However, the article states,  &gt;The Lebron James Family Foundation has led the way in time and funding, though officials say the exact amount it's given is unknown because the support has been a combination of financial and in-kind donations, some of which are still being quantified.  So I don't know where you got that his foundation is not the number one contributor, it seems that information is not yet available.  Regardless, I feel like people are being simple or naïve about how people raise money for charity.  If anybody thought that LBJ was paying for an entire school and hundreds, maybe thousands, of college tuitions out of his pocket...I don't know what to tell you.  At the end of the day this was his vision, and he has used his fame to raise a lot of money for good causes.  He does not have to do any of this, but he has the means and the motivation, and IMO his efforts should be applauded."

I don’t really think this is worth an argument because it’s just a fact that’s how it was reported and it wasn’t just headlines and reddit titles.

Literally says Lebron opened an elementary school and set the kids up for life. 
"1. The school is being called the ""LeBron James Family Foundation I Promise School"" because it would not have been built had it not been for the foundation's efforts.  I think it is fair to call it that. 2. If you are concerned about who is financing the school, as you indicated in your comment, then the line that I quoted from the article clearly shows that it is a public school.  Public School = Public Financing."

"Literally nothing in the article gives the impression he's entirely funding it, either. Plus it includes these quotes:  ""The school, a project of the LeBron James Family Foundation and Akron Public Schools, provides students with a slew of awesome perks.""  ""James, who has given millions to the project, told CNN, ""We want every kid to walk through this school to be inspired, to come ... away with something. Something where they can give back.""""  The only way you take this as a claim that he's paying everything is if you can't read. Especially the second quote, which makes it clear that there's more to the project than what LeBron is giving."
3 rings in an era with no handchecks and a historically bad conference that is basically a clear path to the Finals every year! LeBron James is the GOAT and it's not close!
"I don't think I've seen a single outlet actually try to give this impression. It's only in the the rebuttal that I've seen this claim. It's a straw man.  ""LEBRON JAMES FUNDS SCHOOL WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS""  ""They're lying! He's only *partially* funding the school with those millions of dollars!"""
"The first scholarships to be awarded could only start in 2021 so literally nobody is funding them atm, it’s pure speculation that LeBron isn’t going to be funding them.  &gt;The money is coming from the LeBron James Foundation which is essentially LeBron James raising money and it’s tax deductible for LeBron.   This is hilarious, wtf is your point here? The whole point of taxes is to fund social needs (like public schools), who gives a shit if he doesn’t get taxed on money that he’s literally donating to help impoverished kids..?  &gt;His foundation is supposedly on the hook for $500,000 per year currently which is less than 1% of LeBron’s salary per year.   Did you even read the title?"
Bullshit.   It was clear in literally THE FIRST article I read about the school exactly how much he had donated and how that stacked up to the total funding needed.    [Here is an article from Aug 1](https://www.gobankingrates.com/net-worth/sports/lebron-james-i-promise-school/) that breaks down in detail how the funding stacks up.   Just because you people are to lazy to read an article doesn’t mean anyone was misled.

"He is LeBron James, a famous basketball athlete who is being considered as one of THE best NBA players of all time and is also making millions and millions of dollars... that being said he is also considered as a prominent figure outside of basketball because of his involvement, stance and opinions on serious issues such as civil rights. In addition he comes from a specific background, which has impact on how a lot of people view him - mind you, we still live in a world where many judge people on their ethnic, social, and economic background as well as physical appearance - take all this into consideration his actions of good will, contributions, positivism, that help millions never be enough in certain people's eyes."

That’s not moving the goalposts at all. I guess I didn’t realize that people didn’t understand distinction between a profit and non-profit organization. It never dawned on me that people would try and compare the two.    Your argument is the mere fact that this school wouldn’t have existed without lebron makes him the founder. I pointed out a counter example and now you are angry. You’ve escalated the intensity of this debate at every turn and then tried to accuse me of things. It’s ridiculous.    I’m not up in arms. Talk about a loaded rhetorical device. I am simply off out because LeBron and his team absolutely tried to imply this school was being funded 100 by LeBron James. I also think it’s ridiculous that you can get a personal shrine to yourself paid for with tax payer dollars. I think jock worship is cancerous and id prefer the government stayed out of subsidizing it. 
"&gt; Dude if amazeballs Lebron James was Lebron James but white and he said the same shit he'd be treated the same way.   The claim here *exactly*, is that your statement is proven false.  If Lebron James was white Donald Trump wouldn't have said anything, as proven with Eminem."
You're moving goalposts. The fact that this school specifically would not exist without LeBron James *founding* it means he's the founder. Money has *zero* relevance to what it means to be a founder of an entity. And you act like LeBron wouldn't have put in 100% of the funding if he could.

"I’m not saying that LeBron is at fault by this but the guy I’ve seen reporting it (Clay Travis) has been making the point because he feels like the media isn’t accurately telling the story right now.

His foundation is supposedly on the hook for $500,000 per year currently which is less than 1% of LeBron’s salary per year.

"&gt;“I feel like we’re all equal,” Wall told Yahoo Sports recently from his annual backpack giveaway at Barry Farm. “None of them won a championship. This is no knock on no other team. Don’t get me wrong. Boston is a hell of a team. Philly has great young talent with those guys [Joel] Embiid, [Ben] Simmons. And Toronto, losing DeMar [DeRozan], they still get Kawhi [Leonard]. Y’all might have been to the Eastern Conference finals, where we haven’t been to, but none of y’all were going to the Finals. It was one guy going to the Finals. Ain’t nobody separated from nothing. I know one guy that separated himself from the Eastern Conference every year and that was LeBron James and the Cavs. Other than that … if you lose in the second round, or the conference finals, you still didn’t get to your ultimate goal.  &gt;“On paper, everybody looks great,” Wall continued. “We look great. Boston looks great on paper. But how are all those young guys going to mesh with Kyrie [Irving] being back? Or Gordon Hayward being back? Nobody knows how that’s going to work. Now, they’ve got a hell of a coach in Brad Stevens, and [with GM and president] Danny Ainge, they’re going to figure it out. But you still got to put it all together. You’ve still got to make it work on the court. We don’t know how Kawhi is going to work. We know what Simmons and Embiid are going to give you, but it’s a new year.”  &gt;Wall is determined to not let Game 7 of the 2017 conference semifinals in Boston be where this iteration of the Wizards plateaus, and laughs at the notion that it has already happened.  &gt;“That’s funny. How have we peaked? I think this is deepest team we’ve had and I feel very comfortable with this team,” Wall told Yahoo Sports. “Everybody is going to put Boston No. 1, because that’s what you’re supposed to. They had a hell of a season with those guys coming back. You’ve got Philly, they got their pieces.

I will also mention that LBJ started ""lighter"" transition the summer when he went back to [CLE](https://www.businessinsider.com/experts-lebron-james-diet-2014-9). So he might really be bulking up? Maybe because he'll need some weight/size to play that 5. Lakers' center is McGee if it's not LBJ.  At the 5 position, LBJ can still beat most 5 men off the dribble and expose them easily on offense. LBJ can easily distribute at 5 since most bigs aren't trained or experienced at guarding ball handlers or play creators. Lastly, I felt LBJ has been working on his 3-point shot last year. He's taken both more 3's and hit at a better % than his career averages in 2018. Cavs tried to make KLove a stretch 5 to counter GSW, but ultimately it was not very successful. I'm not sure how LBJ will defend against the real traditional bigs since he's tried to avoid getting bashed down low in the regular season in the past and I don't think he's actually able to defend real 5's that well either. Maybe this new Lakers it's going to be offense oriented with a tough defense on every position outside of the 5 forcing the opposing 5's to ""win"" the games on their own (which might work in current NBA meta since most of the top ""stars"" are guards/wings).  TL;DR King going **T H I C C**"

"Went to a Cavs game in Cleveland last year. First time ever in Cleveland. Absolutely in love with Lebron James. I decide to get to the game early to walk around and see the arena. Two promo girls come up to me to ask if I would partake in a contest. Basically all I do is go on the floor after the first timeout in the 1Q and play the price is right. Every time I get one right I get to move closer to the goal to shoot my shot. Right before I go on the court, a promo guy tells me all the answers! I obviously fan girl walking out there since I'm on the same court as Lebron. My plan is to do the infamous Lebron Silencer after I make the shot considering I know all the answers and it's a layup. (I want to point out here now that I played college basketball only a short 2 years ago) I correctly answer all of the questions and I get the ball on the block and I'm allowed to shoot a layup. Ball goes up, hits the top of the square, front of the rim, and out... I was boo'ed off the court and they ended up giving me the $50 gift card out of pity...  Later on, they put a kid on the big screen that sat near me and he was dancing. The camera panned over onto me and I was boo'ed again. I have no excuses as to why I missed the layup, just one of those things. Sat in silence basically the rest of the night.  EDIT: Someone below found the video! https://youtu.be/jPFaqvb0x50"

"Early august and Ingram already linking up with Bron, this is the best thing that could have happened to Slenderman's career.  Ingram was already known as the hardest worker on the Lakers last season, had huge improvements from rookie to sophomore year, then went around the country and trained with 2 different trainers on his own dime for the first two months of the off season. Now he spends the rest of the off season training with Lebron James? sheesh "
They had Lebron James they also gave  - JR Smith $57/4  - Kyle Korver $22/3  - Tristan Thompson $82/5  Without Lebron they'd still be a non-playoff team
Winning is the point. But beating rivals and seeing them fail is almost as good. I hope James Harden misses every shot he ever takes and the Rockets never win another game. I hope the Mavericks stay crappy for eternity. I hope the Lakers implode and LeBron realizes that he joined a bunch of losers who care more about distracks than basketball.   Also who said anything about getting injured? I said ill on the court. What kind of sociopath must you be that you are always hoping people get hurt?

"How is shooting more important than BBIQ, vision, etc? Lebron is the best player in the league and probs only a top 20 shooter. That doesn’t add up. The intangible skills are what puts the player above and beyond. Plus It isn’t like Lebron falls behind in handling, passing, footwork, etc. He’s got the GOAT handles, passing and footwork for anyone above 6’6. It would be considered better than Kyrie and Steph, only problem is it doesn’t pass casual fans’ eye tests because he doesn’t look hella bouncy. That man is blowing by people and crossing fools while weighing 265. Have you seen that mans negative step? Have you seen how far people have to sag on him from outside the key? They have to respect that first step bc it’s literally the best first step in history. Watch attention to detail: LeBron James by By Any Means Basketball.

Indiana isn’t a bad choice to make it out of the East either though. They had a really good offseason on top of their young guys possibly improving a lot.

"1) Felecio - Yeah, he did take a big step back after signing the contract. Although, at the end of last year, he once again was looking like a serviceable backup. It’s a bit of an overpay, but seeing as how the bulls avoided over paying Ben Gordon, Loul deng, Noah, and generally have had some of the cleanest books in the league in terms of bad contracts, i wouldn’t be that disappointed with that as my FO major over pay.   2) yeah, in retrospect, there were definitely better players available than Doug. That said, context is important. The bulls thought they had a team with two MVP ballot caliber players, Butler, and Pau. It looked like if they added some shooters they could be in line to win a chip. They did not have roster space or minutes to give to all their potential draft picks, so packaging them and moving up to draft the best shooter in the class made a ton of sense. Even though he’s not a lottery caliber player, he still is the best three point shooting specialist from his class and has the bulls been healthy, he could’ve been a great role player as an 8th man shooting specialist.   Seeing as how the team drafted rose over Beasley, Noah over Spencer hawed, Butler at 30, taj in the 20s, Portis in the 20s, Niko in the 20s, Lauri at 7, WCJ at 7, etc. the team really has drafted well above average. Every team has some misses, but it’s clearly been a strength for the organization.   3) they would not have re-signed taj as a free agent that summer. They also were ready to move on from Doug. They traded two guys who they had no plans for, clearing up minutes for Niko and Portis, both of who drastically improved their performance by getting the extra court time. Niko ended up getting them an extra first round pick. Also, they got a lottery pick in Cam Payne from the trade. He looked like garbage, but after his foot surgery he actually was very impressive as a young prospect again at the end of last year. OkC now has none of those players, and got nothing for Taj. They honestly probably won that trade, but regardless it wasn’t a bad trade. We’ll get to the second pick in number 7.   4) yeah, smell needed to go. He’s had a nice resurgence with Milwaukee, but he was playing 30 minutes and putting up literally no stats, nothing, just 0/0/0/0/0. He had no trade value, and he deserved new scenery. I’m very happy he’s the played well. I also don’t hate MCW like is popular on this sub. He’s a great defender. Yeah, his offense sucks. We don’t harp constantly on Beverly for being a weak spot on offense. Sure, he’s not as good as Beverly, but you could never have traded a guy not getting any stats for a player as good as Beverly.   5) yeah Tyrus is easily this FO biggest mistake. It also happened 12 years ago. They never would’ve gotten Noah or rose if they drafted Aldridge and so maybe they wouldn’t have had a team fighting for contention. You just don’t know. Certainly a mistake, but every front office has them. If it was the norm they’d have to go, but it’s clearly been the exception.   6) Kyle Korver was not the same player at all for the bulls. Even he himself says he underwent a dramatic personal life evolution that has resulted in his improved play. There’s no way the team could know that, and it can’t be factored into his trade value at the time. https://www.outsideonline.com/1928041/one-day-year-fitness-plan (this is an AWESOME read BTW)  7) The Bulls never drafted Jordan Bell. They never would’ve drafted Jordan bell. They had 3 PF on the roster who are all clearly better than bell (Markannen, Niko, Portis). The bulls also had 14 players under contract. You can have 17 including your 2 two way contracts. If you draft someone in the second round, you have to rescind their draft rights in order to sign them to a two way contract. The bulls did not need a PF and wanted to get Nwaba off of waivers.   Had the bulls drafted bell, they either couldn’t have signed Nwaba, who was much more useful to them, or they would have to rescind his draft rights to sign him to a 2 way. If they had done that, GS could’ve signed him for free. The bulls were tanking and didn’t want any vets. No one is trading a young prospect for a second round pick. As a fan do I care about the money, no, but it’s a good sign that the FO got the absolute maximum possible value for a second round pick they could not sign rather than giving him up for free. They also got blakenley undrafted and he easily could have a remarkable career as a microwave off the bench. Again, much more useful to the franchise than another PF.   Sorry man, you really aren’t showing how they deserve to be fired. Are they the best FO in basketball, no. But they’ve had a lot of success, been derailed by awful injury fortunate, have steered clear of ever being finically unable to make moves, and have drafted well.   They managed to get RoLo trading away Rose’s Supermax. They got a very nice haul for Butler. They are one of only 2 teams that got a pick traded to them last trade deadline, and they traded Niko, not Blake griffin.   People really seem to ignore that both Wade and James have stated they tgo gut they were going to Chicago in 2011. It was only when the heat managed to free up space to sign all 3 that Wade and James changed their minds. They almost had a team of Noah, rose, LeBron, Wade and they still could’ve drafted Butler at 30. "
LeBron James is way to low imo
Kevin Durant/ Steph curry and Lebron James are **way** better than Russ
"please elaborate on your lebron james answer.  how does he control all aspects of the game. hes a defense liability.  yeah he can chase you down and block you from behind, other than that hes pathetic on D... distributing the ball, get the fuck out of here! he puts baby in the corner and dribbles for 20 seconds leading to no offense flow and passing it to a 3 point shooter with no time on the shot clock and complains when they miss. he played great this playoffs offensively ill give him that but you guys gotta think for yourself and not swallow everything media feeds you"
Anthony Davis will start at C this year and mostly playing that position.  Also Lebron will start at PF and play a lot of PF and C this year.  1. Lebron James  2. Giannis Antetounmkpo  3. Lamarcus Aldridge  4. Draymond Green  5. Kevin Love 
the lebron james 3 step then stiff arm
"Going back to 2013 (the year of The Fleecing) these are the trades Ainge has made:  -Garnett, Pierce, Jason Terry, DJ White for the corpse of Gerald Wallace, Kris Humphries, Keith Bogans, Marshon Brooks, and Kris Joseph along with 3 unprotected firsts in 2014-16-18 along with a pick swap in 2017.   We all know what happened here, Ainge completed one of his signature deals of his reign as GM in trading off aged stars in Garnett and Pierce for the future in James Young (2014), Jaylen Brown (2016), and Jayson Tatum (2017). None of the players were long for their destinations as Garnett and Pierce left after their contracts expired and same for the pieces acquired by Boston.  -Not a trade but signed untested young coach Brad Stevens from Butler. It was a risk as Stevens had little experience but he has seemingly become one of the best coaches in the league.   -Traded Humphries for a 2015 protected 2nd, basically an offloading of a contract for little in return, the pick never transferred  -Traded Rondo and Dwight Powell for Jameer Nelson, Jae Crowder, Brandan Wright, a 12 million dollar exception, a 1st round pick, and a 2nd round pick.   This one was a big one, while Nelson/Wright weren't important, Crowder was a key piece for the Celtics over the next season plus a couple of picks that turned into Yabusele Gueschon who was a stash pick and Demetrious Jackson. Neither have been major pieces outside of Yabusele's infectious attitude. Rondo fell out of favor in Dallas and was a bench player during their playoff run before leaving and becoming a journeyman over the past few years.   -traded a conditional 2nd for Perry Jones III and a second round pick in 2019. Another what the hell move, OKC needed to open up a trade slot and dealt a player they gave up on for nothing along with a 2nd in the far future to get the Celtics to accept.   -traded Tayshaun Price for Jonas Jerebko and Gigi Datome. Again Ainge dealt someone who was gone by the end of the year and wanted out of a ""tanking"" team. Jerebko was a solid role player for several years, Datome was a warm body for the end of the bench.   -traded Marcus Thornton, a 2016 first round pick (from Cleveland acquired when they were getting Lebron back and needed to clear room, ended up being 28th overall), and the 12 million dollar trade exception for Isaiah Thomas.   This was another big one. IT became a star and fan favorite in Boston and was acquired for an extremely late first, a bench player that is out of the NBA now, and a trade exception. This trade set up the Celtics for a run to the ECF and 1st seed in the East two years later.  -Not a trade but: signed Al Horford to a 4 year deal. Yes I know this isn't a trade, but this was the biggest FA signing in Boston of all time. Boston wasn't a big FA destination just about ever due to NBA players preferring the combination of warm weather, party destinations, and limelight that places such as LA, Miami, New York could offer them.   -traded the 1st overall pick (2017 Nets pick) for the 3rd overall pick and the Kings pick in 2019.   Ainge traded down from 1st overall and got promising rookie Jayson Tatum and another potential top-5 pick along with avoiding the shit show of what happened with 1st overall pick Markelle Fultz's missed season (Fultz still is very promising but missed a full season while Ainge's pick performed admirably in the playoffs as a top-2 option)  -traded Avery Bradley for Marcus Morris and a 2019 2nd round pick.   This trade was a necessity with Boston signing Gordon Hayward and needing cap space plus Bradley being a FA at the end of the season and likely demanding more than Boston would afford. Avery was an exceptional perimeter defender in Boston and was seen as an underrated player due to his skillset being not known to casual fans and analytics not judging him well. Morris was a role player and seen as a downgrade however Bradley had his worst season in years due to injuries and ineffectiveness in Detroit and then in LA after a mid-season trade to the Clippers.   -Traded Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic, and the 2018 Nets pick for Kyrie Irving.   This was the knife, with Isaiah Thomas out for half of the season, Ainge needed to remake the Celtics competitively and trading Thomas plus other assets for disgruntled Kyrie Irving made sense even if it was a knife in the back of a fan favorite. Ainge managed to get a PG that was more in line with the team's future core than an undersized PG that was almost 30. Thomas and Crowder are already out of Cleveland, leaving Zizic and Colin Sexton as the final pieces of the trade of Irving in Cleveland.   Hopefully this didn't come off as too braggy but that was step by step how he did it.   TL;DR: Ainge turned Garnett, Pierce, Terry, Rondo, Bradley, and IT for Brown, Tatum, Irving, Morris, and the Kings pick while opening up space to sign Horford/Hayward."

"Easily Lebron James in my opinion. Basically before he entered the league ,the media talked about him being a probable contender for GOAT. They obviously kept on pushing the narrative. Today we can see that the hype was warranted but back then many people saw him as a guy who would never be able to truly step up in the playoffs like MJ. The continous push from the media pissed many people off because it was basically herecy to even think about someone coming close to MJ.   It's not as bad as it used to be though. 8-10 years ago you could click on any youtube video related to the NBA and the top 2-3 comments would be negative comments about Lebron. "

"Bro, he's a 16-year-old basketball player lol, basketball isn't football, you don't need to be a grown ass man when you are that young to be successful. In fact, you don't need to be overly muscular at any point (see: KD). I'm sure he's on some bs training regiment that he fucks around and doesn't take seriously his biggest problem, and a lot of peoples problem at that age is most likely he isn't eating enough to get big. But again, he doesn't have to.   &gt; Definitely below where he should be  With the exception of LeBron James, most basketball players look like this when they're 16  Edit - Last thing, LeBron didn't start to look like an actual man (looking past his height, speaking physique wise) until junior-senior year so he was 17-18 years old.

Next thread: Lebron James would not have been a professional bodybuilder. 
LeBron James was just a bigger Eric Bledsoe. He didn't do much else. His defense was overrated. He was fast and sometimes took possessions off. I just don't get it. If Bledsoe had Bosh and Wade he would've won 2 titles also.   Not Miami LeBron. He was athletic asf. This is old LeBron on his third run with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2025

"lmao. Have you not learned anything about loyalty in the nba this year? Dirk took less because he wanted to win and front offices love that and pretend to be all lovey dubby about it and stick the loyalty label on it. Wade did the exact same thing in Miami until he was old. He put it off for the betterment of the team and he was screwed. At that point he had no power because was no longer as good.  If old man Dirk asked for the max when the Mavs were clearly a losing team anyways and had no reason to be worried about harming the team, Cuban still would not do it. If old man Duncan asked the Spurs for the max, the Spurs wouldn't max him. If old and no longer good Lebron James asked the Cavs for the max, they'd trade his ass. Michael Jordan got screwed by the Bulls and the Wizards as well when he asked to be part owner. He signed for less with the Wizards doing the 'right thing' and what they wanted, and then they screwed him when he was even older and retired and no longer valuable."

Controversial - A lot of people think Ben Simmons has a Lebron James ceiling. But his ceiling will actually be Lamar Odom. Which is not bad but I know everyone around here thinks everyone drafted has top ten potential.
"If Kyrie bailing out of Cleveland wasn't on some level a personal diss of LeBron, he would have come out and said it. He didn't, and there is clearly beef.  LeBron just tried to ""dad"" Kyrie one time too many. His arrogance and lack of self-awareness are what drove Kyrie away...well, that and the fact that Kyrie knew that Bron would bounce this summer, anyway, and didn't want to get caught on the sinking ship that is the Cavs. Kyrie was fed up with the scene in Cleveland, a scene which was almost entirely the creation of LeBron James.   He does this stuff to himself because he's not quite as smart as he thinks he is."

"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair? "
"Yes, Kobe Bryant is arguably the most overrated basketball player in history. He is often ranked among the Top-Ten players of all time, which I think this is absurd. The following are the reasons I consider Kobe overrated: Kobe is NOT an All-Time Great Scorer. One of the most prevalent arguments as to why Kobe is a all-time great, is his supposedly legendary scoring ability, which is often compared to all-time great, Michael Jordan. However, lets take a closer look at this claim and show why it is flawed: Kobe has only 2 Scoring Titles. Kobe has only lead the league in points per game 2 times, in 19-year career. In comparison: Michael Jordan has done so 10 times. Wilt Chaimberlain has done so 7 times. Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson have done so 4 times. (KD has been in the NBA, less than half the time Kobe had, and has twice the number of scoring titles) Kobe has a Career Points-Per-Game Average of 25. Kobe averaged 25 PPG, over his career. This is a fantastic average, however, it does not rank among the greatest career averages. Kobe’s PPG average does NOT rank among the Top 10. LeBron’s career average is 27.2 PPG, while Kobe’s career average in the same span was 24.8. However, Kobe is generally considered a greater scorer. Allen Iverson, who is generally not considered among the greatest NBA players ever, had a career average of 26.7 PPG, also greater than that of Kobe. Kobe has had the Worst Chokes in the NBA Finals. Kobe is often ranked among the most clutch players in NBA history. This is not backed by substance, and this is evidenced in some of his NBA Finals performances over the years. 2004 NBA Finals: Game 3 vs Detroit Pistons In Game 3 of the 2004 NBA Finals, against the Detroit Pistons, with the series tied at 1–1, Kobe had arguably the worst choke of any superstar in Finals history, which led to a loss by 20 points. Kobe finished the game with just 11 Points on a terrible 30% shooting, with 3 Rebounds, 5 Assists and 4 Turnovers. 2008 NBA Finals: Game 6 vs Boston Celtics Facing elimination, with his team down 3–2 in the series, with a chance to force a Game 7 in Staples Center, Kobe, the reigning MVP of the league, choked again in one of the biggest games of his career, which led to the Lakers losing the Championship. Kobe finished the game with 22 Points on a dismal 32% shooting, with just 3 Rebounds and a pathetic 1 Assist with 4 Turnovers. 2010 NBA Finals: Game 7 vs Boston Celtics With a brilliant chance at redemption, against a Boston Celtics team that defeated his Lakers two years ago, Kobe had a chance to cement his legacy as a clutch performer on the biggest stage of all: Game 7 of the NBA Finals, at home. Yet, he choked again. Kobe finished the game with 23 Points, of which he scored 11 from the free-throw line, thanks to receiving a ridiculous 15 free-throw attempts (ahem Referees? ahem). He scored 12 Points from the field on a awful 25% shooting, with just 1 Assist and 4 Turnovers, but did have a stellar 15 Rebounds. But thanks to the Referees (The Lakers got 20 more free-throws than the Celtics), the Lakers happened to win this game and Kobe won his 5th Ring. Compare these chokes with LeBron’s Finals: Game 4 performance against the Mavericks, which sparked conversation about LeBron being a Choke-Artist. LeBron put up a measly 8 Points on 27% shooting, but had 9 Rebounds and 7 Assists, therefore having about similar production as Kobe’s in the fore-mentioned games. Kobe has only ONE Regular Season MVP (Which he didn’t really deserve). Kobe Bryant has only one regular season MVP , which is put 12 players who have more MVPs than him. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has done so 6 times. Michael Jordan has done so 5 times. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson have done so 3 times. Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry have done so 2 times. Kobe Bryant did win the 2007–2008 season, but did not deserve it. Let us take a look at Kobe’s stats, compared to other players’ performances. Kobe Bryant: 28.2 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 5.4 APG, 1.8 SPG, 0.5 BPG, 46% FG, 36% 3P, with a record 57–25. Chris Paul: 21.1 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 11.6 APG, 2.7 SPG, 0.1 BPG, 49% FG, 37%3P, with a record 56–26. LeBron James: 30.0 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 7.2 APG, 1.8 SPG, 1.1 BPG, 48% FG, 32% 3P, with the record 45–37. Amar’e Stoudemire: 25.2 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 1.5 APG, 0.8 SPG, 2.1 BPG, 59% FG, 16% 3P, with the record 55–27. Kobe is an Extremely Inefficient player. Kobe Bryant has an Career Field Goal Percentage of 44.7%. Kobe Bryant, despite being a versatile scorer, has thelowest field goal percentageamong the Top 15 All-Time Career Scorers. Kobe Bryant has scored a total 33,643 Points, off 26,200 Shots. In Comparison, Karl Malone has scored a total of 36,928 Points, off 26,210 Shots. Which means, Karl Malone has taken 10 more shots than Kobe Bryant, but has scored 3,285 more points. Kobe has the Most Career Field Goals Missed. Kobe has missed 14,481 Shots in his career, which happens to be 1,064 more than the next player, John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant hold the record with the Most Missed Shotsin a single game with 30 while shooting just 36% against the Boston Celtics in 2002. In the Top 100 for most field goals missed in a game, Kobe hold 25 of those spots, making for a quarter of the total. Kobe Bryant is NOT a clutch player. Kobe does have some great moments in the clutch, but individual moments do not mean he is a great clutch performer. Kobe Bryant missed the last 15 straight game-tying/go-ahead FG in final 5 seconds of 4th quarter/OT of his career, and his last game-winner was in March 2012. Kobe Bryant has a Field-Goal Percentage of 29.1%, over his career, on game-tying or go ahead shots in the last 24 seconds of a game, over his career, only making 48 out of 164 attempts Kobe Bryant has received multiple Undeserved All-Star Selections. Kobe Bryant has been selected to the All-Star Game in the years 2014 and 2016, for which he was undeserving. He received these on the basis of legacy, rather than on performance. His stats for these seasons were: In 2014, Kobe Bryant played a total of 6 games, where he averaged just 13.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG and 6.3 APG. In 2016, Kobe averaged 17.6 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 2.8 APG. Kobe has been gifted Multiple Championships by Referees. Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, whether knowingly or unknowingly, have been subject to some of the most blatantly rigged NBA Playoff games, in history. 2002 Western Conference Finals In Game 6, of a tight western conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, where the reigning champion Lakers were facing elimination, the Lakers received a ridiculous27 Free-Throws, in the fourth quarter, compared to the Kings’ 9. Watch the video below to see for yourself: 2010 NBA Finals In Game 7 of the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics, Kobe shot a disgusting 6 of 24 from the field. However, thanks to the 15 Free-Throwshanded to him by the referees, compared to the whole Boston Celtics team got 17 Free-Throws, Kobe won his 5th Ring. Watch the following video to see yourself: Now I am not saying Kobe is not a legend, I am simply saying that he is given much more credit than some of his more deserving contemporaries. He deserves to be compared to players like John Stocktonand Reggie Miller who are fantastic players, but NOT All-Time Greats like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Tough question because most basketball experts do not overrate him. Most place him somewhere in the top 10–15. That’s about right. But most young basketball fans do overrate him. Many put him in the top 5. Those that do usually do not have strong knowledge of basketball history; usually overrate individual play; and usually overrate athleticism. Players that are definitely ahead of Kobe: Jordan, Magic Johnson, Jabbar, Russell, Chamberlain, Lebron James In my view, none of these are worth debating versus Kobe. Players that are probably ahead of Kobe: Duncan, O’Neal, Bird, Olajuwon, Robertson Players that are close and/or may finish their careers as close: West, Durant, Curry, Moses Malone So, in my view, Kobe is 12th at highest. Or somewhere in the 10–14 range. That’s still great. So what I say next does not diminish him but only puts him in context versus the other great players. Kobe Bryant is definitely the most selfish and least likable teammate of anyone on the list. (Chamberlain is close on the selfish front. Robertson is close on the least likable front). When I engage in these discussions with my fellow GMs, we set up the ground rule as who would I want on my team for 5 years. This is an important distinction because character/personality become increasingly important over time. Indeed, Kobe would likely be in the top ten if this was a single game or single series. Shaq is another guy that loses ground in this area. At his peak, he was crazy dominant but his laziness and selfishness are draining after a period of time. As a contrast, Duncan and Magic are rated higher than their athleticism might indicate because they are the ultimate team guys. But Kobe’s character deflates his teammates, unlike the majority of those ahead of him who elevate their teammates. Over time, team chemistry decreases. And, of course, losses or implosion occur. Is Kobe overrated by young NBA fans, yes. "
"I think lebron is clearly the better playmaker than Kd,  I just don’t think it’s this huge gap like people think it is.  A big part of playmaking , is pace, which I don’t think James harden gets enough credit for.  He is tremendous at getting assists with good pace.  And good pace tends to keep guys in rhythm.  Lebron plays at such a slow pace,  even tho he gets assists I feel guys who need pace (George Hill , Rodney hood) suffer in production cause they 1) aren’t used to playing so slow and 2) when they finally get the ball they have zero Rhythm and their production suffers. "
"He took a longer contract prior to that for more money and Bron and wade wanted him to be a free agent the same year but he wanted the extra year. Here is a link source. The rest is quoted from reddit post:     Carmelo had the opportunity to join LeBron and Wade in Miami but wanted to get paid more, Carmelo had the opportunity to join the Knicks in FA but gutted the team because he wanted to get there sooner  Here’s the quick version: In 2006, the members of the 2003 NBA Draft class were up for extensions. That included James, Anthony, Wade and Bosh. James was the best of the group at that point, but it was close, and he urged Wade and Anthony to take three-year extensions (with a player option for a fourth year).  ""And, uh, Melo,"" James recalled to Bleacher Report, ""Melo took the five-year.""  http://thelab.bleacherreport.com/brotherhood/  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8u870x/carmelo_had_the_opportunity_to_join_lebron_and/"

"LeBron James... He plays absoultely 0 defense nowadays and walks more than he runs and I hate ""the LeBron system"" of basketball"
"Being a centre isn't just about defending post ups though.   The Lebron we saw last season would get roasted as the primary defensive option at C by the warriors. In Miami he probably could have been able to do it, but he isn't that kind of player anymore on defense. You can't just have James as your primary rim protector against the Warriors. They will score a vast majority of their points in the paint on great efficiency imo in that matchup if Lebron is playing a lot of 5."
Lebron James. Wasted talent.
My favorite team is Lebron James
"**Speaking about the West,**  Lebron is locked in for a spot  Boogie is clearly out  **Questionable/Competitive for spots:**  Draymond green  Paul George  Lamarcus Aldridge  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Karl-Anthony Towns  **Some new guys who may make the cut:**  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Nikola Jokic  DeMar DeToronto  **Fairly safe list:**  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Lebron James  Klay Thompson  **Definitely not going to make the cut:**  Melo  A lot of these spots depend on team standing as well as individual numbers. The MVP players(James, Curry, Durant, Westbrook, Harden) can coast in based on reputation even if they are having a rough season."
"First and foremost, I want to clarify that I am not a perfect person. Quite the contrary, actually. I've been called names my whole life. I've been put down for the type of person I am. I was openly mocked for things that were out of my control.  But coming to this sub really changed my perspective on a lot of things. And r/nba opened its arms to a man who couldn't find a mutual connection anywhere else.  Let me explain my backstory a little bit; this past January, my dog abandoned me, taking my food and three beautiful puppies with her. She left me broke, depressed, and desperate. I turned to many outlets that I shouldn't have, trying to fill a void that was left by a dog who may have never loved me. It was the bleakest period of my life.  The primary reason she stated for our divorce, you ask? My ""unusual homosexual feelings towards NBA players, such as Lebron James or Brian Scalabrine"". She actually wrote that down on the divorce papers, and her lawyer approved it. What I was most ashamed of was suddenly out in the open. My dirty laundry was being aired.  However, I was able to maintain sanity by typing ""reddit.com/nba"" into my incognito Chrome browser on a nightly basis. You guys helped me feel like I wasn't alone.  Turns out, I'm not the only one who has sexual fantasies about riding a blow-up banana boat with LeBron James, or who imagines what it'd be like to have my cranium squeezed by Kyle Lowry's rock-hard glutes. These are all normal thoughts. I would've never been able to come out of the closet the way I did without the love and support of so many members of this community.  From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU."
"In a perfect world, they would absolutely do this. In the Eastern Conference, maybe. But in the bloodbath that is the Western Conference, they'll want to make a point of AT LEAST making the playoffs. And to do that, you play LeBron James. "
"The question is how reliable are they as creators and how much value does their playmaking add to an offense. The Lakers had a bottom ten offense last season and Randle was your best player, I doubt they’d be competent without James to fix this oddly constructed roster. Lonzo’s passing didn’t have a positive influence on the floor last year (LA’s offense was a tick better with him off the floor) and Rondo has long carried pedestrian offensive impact in the Rs because of his scoring limitations (Boston’s offense for instance was horrible when he began to assert himself as a creator) and penchant for ignoring open shooting opportunities for an assist. None of those wings are top 40 players, depth is cool but you’ll need experienced star power for LeBron   When you guys get Kawhi though it’ll be fine. Right now, I’d be surprised if LeBron didn’t lead the league in mpg and stuff the box score out of necessity  "
"Ok, so a few things.   First this list did not include Cousins, Gobert, Aldridge, and Davis for various reasons. If they were included he would drop even more in all of these rankings.   Second, these rankings are fairly consistent, that means they mostly agree with each other. If they mostly agree with each other, we can assume they are fairly accurate.  Third, there is a difference between comparing stats across eras and comparing stats over a single season. Different eras come with different rules, and different rules can affect stats.  Fourth, comparing full careers can result in funny business as a player who play more non-prime years can hurt their averages and advance stats.  Fifth, Charles Barkley was a top player all-time. I imagine most lists have him as a top 15 to 25 player all-time. Is it really that absurd that a player that good would have advance stats that say he is a top-5 player all time? The difference between the GOAT and the 25th best player all-time is very very small. We are talking about the difference between Lebron James and Kevin Durant here. That is a difference so small it is almost irrelevant."
The Lakers beating the Orlando Magic was spearheaded by Kobe Bryant. And that the Cavaliers were upsetted by that same team. It's one of the reasons why I don't consider LeBron James the best player that year. Because they had won a league high 66 games and couldn't get past the Magic. While the Lakers made relatively short work of the Magic. The Lakers had the better team and they had the better player. 
G: Michael Jordan F: LeBron James C: Shaquille O’Neal   VS   PG: Whitey Kachan SG: Johnny Jorgenson SF: Phil Farbman PF: Earl Gardner  C: Oliver Miller 
And the Lakers don’t have a Irving or Wade to take advantage of the single coverage while James is being denied the ball.  I’m pretty sure LeBron will have to one man army this team into the postseason. Not good enough to allow him to lessen his burden
Ummm Lebron James?? 
"Tatum, KAT, Kawhi (only because we haven’t seen him play in like a year) and Lebron James Jr (yes i’m calling a young child overrated, I absolutely went there)"
"Thats true, but atleast the sixers had a clear plan. The lakers where just fucking up and walked into LeBron James. "

"He’s a mid 30s 3 point shooter.   And if you take the ball out of lebrons hand on offense, you give up LeBron James’ biggest asset "
Magic Johnson  Pete Maravich  LeBron James  Chris Webber  Nikola Jokic
"I like the list, I would add some players that havent reached yet.  I know its early but I think RJ Barrett has an excellent chance to being a great player.  I think he is the best prospect since Lebron James..... I am not saying he will be great but I am saying that he has as good of a chance to be great as any player of  the past 15 years or so"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.  You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?  "
"I'm going to disagree with your first point because he was still a young player when he got injured. Every year up until that point he was adding to his game. Theres no reason to believe he would have settled on being an average shooter. He was so deadly before the injury that a prime defensive Lebron James had to be put on him. Let that sink in. Rose scared the Heat enough that they put LeBron on him. And that was with Rose having a questionable shot.   Fair points on your second paragraph. I do agree with you that. Only thing I can really say is Rose was a young player and young players tend to get better. Curry was a shit defender when he entered the league but hes turned it around and became a good enough defender to where hes not a liability anymore. I think Rose could have done the same.  Rose lead the Bulls team to a 62 win season before he hit his prime. Efficiency wasnt an issue with him. He [never cared about his stats](http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20101112/sports/711139797/)he only cared about helping his team win. And he did that when he lead those bulls to the ECF   My claim to this topic is a lot of ""what ifs"", so i understand why you have your doubts. I just have a lot of faith that the youngest MVP in league history would get better if he was healthy."
